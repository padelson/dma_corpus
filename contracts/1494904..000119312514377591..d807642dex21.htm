otherwise would have had to pay to resolve such claims due to the CompanyÂ’s
management of such claims inconsistent with the CompanyÂ’s management of non-
Section 2.5 Claims of similar category, nature and exposure, or (iii) that
the loss or loss adjusted expense reserves in respect of one or more Section
2.5 Claims which had not yet been resolved is greater by more than an
immaterial amount than the amount the Company otherwise would have
established for non-Section 2.5 Claims due to the establishment of such
reserves being inconsistent with the manner in which the Company establishes
reserves in respect of non-Section 2.5 Claims of similar category, nature and
exposure, then Seller shall deliver a reasonably detailed written statement
(the " _Reserves Adjustment Dispute Notice_ ") describing such objections to
Buyer within ninety (90) days of receipt of the Reserves Calculation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances may Seller set forth an
objection in the Reserves Adjustment Dispute Notice pursuant to clause (ii)
above unless Seller includes in the Reserves Adjustment Dispute
Notice specific factual allegations supporting the objections therein. Seller
shall be conclusively deemed to have accepted the Reserves Calculation except
to the extent that Seller has set forth specific objections in the Reserves
Adjustment Dispute Notice within such ninety (90) day period.

(g) Within twenty (20) days following BuyerÂ’s receipt of the
Reserves Adjustment Dispute Notice, Buyer shall send to Seller a reasonably
detailed written notice of its disagreement with the Reserves Adjustment
Dispute Notice (if any), or any component thereof (a " _Reserves Adjustment
Response Notice_ "). Buyer shall be conclusively deemed to have accepted the
Reserves Adjustment Dispute Notice except to the extent that Buyer has
objected to particular line items in the Reserves Adjustment Dispute Notice
within such twenty (20)-day period. Seller and Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any remaining objections among themselves within ten (10)
days following SellerÂ’s receipt of the Reserves Adjustment Response Notice. If
such objections are resolved between Seller and Buyer, the Final Reserves
Calculation shall be as agreed in writing between Seller and Buyer. Any
adjustments that are agreed to in writing between Seller and Buyer shall be
incorporated into the Final Reserves Calculation. If Seller and Buyer are
unable to reach a final resolution on all of the remaining objections
relating to the Reserves Calculation within such ten (10)-day period following
SellerÂ’s receipt of the

 



16  Reserves Adjustment Response Notice, such remaining objections (" _Reserves
Calculation Dispute_ ") shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Exhibit E_  hereto (the " _Reserves Dispute Resolution
Procedures_ ").

(h) The " _Final Reserves Calculation_ " shall mean the Reserves Calculation,
unless there has been a permitted objection thereto in accordance with
_Sections 2.5(f)_ and _(g)_ , and in such case, the Reserves Calculation as
adjusted in accordance with _Section 2.5(g)_ and the Reserves Dispute
Resolution Procedures.

(i) If the Final Reserves Calculation exceeds or is less than the Reserve
Calculation, then payment by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller, as
applicable, shall be (i) made promptly and in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the determination of the Final Reserve Calculation,
together with simple interest on such amounts at a rate of 90-day Treasury
Rate in effect on the Closing Date, from and including the Closing Date, to,
but excluding, the date of payment and (ii) treated by the parties for all
purposes as adjustments to the Closing Purchase Price.

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to

stock of the Company consists of 255,000 shares of common stock, par value
$20.04 per share, of which 209,580 shares (the " _Shares_ ") are issued and

shares are issued and outstanding, comprising 900 Class A Voting Common shares
and 100 Class B Non-Voting Common shares. Except as set forth in the

agreement, collective bargaining agreement, work rules or practices, or any
other labor-related agreements or arrangements with any labor union, labor
organization or works council with respect to any Employee. No labor union,
labor organization, works council or Employee has made a pending demand for
recognition or certification to the Company or USIS with respect to any
Employees, and there are no representation or certification proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened
in writing to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations Board or
any other labor relations tribunal or authority with respect to any Employees.
Since January 1, 2012, there has been no actual or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened unfair labor practice charges, material grievances,

or any filings with or notifications to, any Governmental Entity ("
_Government Approvals_ ") or Third Party Consents that may be or become
reasonably necessary for the execution and delivery of, and consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
In connection therewith, the parties hereto shall make and cause their

Governmental Entities that are or may become reasonably necessary under the
Transaction Agreements and Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
and shall provide and shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide such
information and communications to Governmental Entities as such Governmental
Entities may reasonably request. As permitted under Applicable Law, each of
the parties shall provide to the other party copies of all applications or

Agreement in advance of the filing or submission thereof. The parties agree to
supply the appropriate Governmental Entities with any additional information
and documentary material that may be reasonably requested thereof. The
parties shall reasonably assist each other in seeking to obtain all such
approvals and in making all such filings.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, within ten (10)

shall file with all applicable Governmental Entities requests for approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,

38  submitted as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. The parties, as
applicable, shall make or cause to be made any other filing that may be
required by any Applicable Laws. A reasonable time prior to furnishing any

to provide comments thereon. Each party shall give to the other party prompt
written notice if it receives any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and, in the case of any such notice or
communication which is in writing, shall promptly furnish the other party with
a copy thereof. Each party shall consult with each other with respect to
obtaining any Government Approvals or Third Party Consents that may be or may
become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to be made or obtained (as
applicable) by Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the
status of all such Government Approvals or Third Party Consents;  _provided_
, _however_ , in no event will any party hereto be required to disclose to any
other party any Trade Secrets or personally identifiable information or
personal financial statements in respect of a party or its shareholders
or Affiliates. Further, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the other partyÂ’s Representatives have the right to attend or
otherwise participate in any hearing proceeding, meeting, or similar event
before or with a Governmental Entity (excluding any such event or portion
thereof relating to matters that are confidential under Applicable Law) to the
extent relating specifically to any Government Approvals required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including the Restructuring Transactions. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly
as possible but in no event later than the Closing, any Third Party Consents
that may be or may become required, necessary, proper or advisable to be
obtained. The parties hereto agree that any reasonable costs and expenses
payable to third parties in connection with the procurement of any such
Third Party Consents shall be borne by Seller. In the event the parties
hereto are unable to obtain any such Third Party Consents (i) Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts in cooperation with Buyer to (A) provide or cause to
be provided to Buyer the benefits of such agreement or asset and (B) enforce
for the account of Buyer any rights of Seller and its Affiliates arising from
such agreement or asset and (ii) Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to

asset to Buyer and Buyer shall assume such rights and obligations.

(c) From the date hereof to the Closing, upon the request of a party, the
other shall, and in the case of Seller shall cause the Company and USIS to,
provide commercially reasonable cooperation and assistance to such party and
its counsel in the preparation of, and, at the direction of such party, the
submitting or making of governmental or regulatory filings as may reasonably
be requested by such party in connection with actions proposed to be taken or
agreements proposed to be entered into by the Company or USIS on the Closing
Date that relate to customary affiliate transactions with respect to Tax
sharing or Tax allocation, investment management, reinsurance or services
agreements (the " _Accommodation Filings_ "); _provided_ , that the
effectiveness of all such Accommodation Filings and the actions and
agreements

 



39  contemplated thereby shall be conditioned on the consummation of the
Closing. The parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly provide to the other party copies of any written responses to such
Accommodation Filings and reasonable assistance to the other party regarding
any information or document requests from any Governmental Entity in regard to
such filings.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
obligated to take or refrain from taking or to agree to it, its Affiliates or
the Company or USIS taking or refraining from taking any action, or to suffer
to exist any restriction, condition, limitation, requirement or effect which,
individually or together with all other such actions, restrictions,
conditions, limitations, requirements or effects would, or would reasonably
be expected to, (i) impose any limitations on BuyerÂ’s ownership or operation
of all or any portion of its, any of its AffiliatesÂ’, the CompanyÂ’s or
USISÂ’ operations or assets or to compel Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the
Company or USIS to dispose of or hold separate all or any portion of its, any
of its AffiliatesÂ’, the CompanyÂ’s or USISÂ’ operations or assets, (ii) impose
any limitations on the ability of Buyer to acquire or hold or to exercise
full rights of ownership of the Shares or (iii) have a negative effect on the
benefits, taken as a whole, that Buyer would otherwise reasonably expect to
derive from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements had Buyer not been obligated to take or refrain from
taking or to agree to it, its Affiliates or the Company or USIS taking or
refraining from taking any action, or to suffer to exist any restriction,
condition, limitation, requirement or effect and in the case of clauses (i),
(ii) and/or (iii), that would reasonably be expected to have more than an
immaterial adverse effect on the Buyer, the Company, USIS or any of their
respective Affiliates or the value Buyer expects to derive from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements
(in each of the cases of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "). Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller
shall not, and shall cause the Company and USIS not to, take any action or
agree to the taking or refraining from any action or accept any restriction,
condition, limitation or requirement that, individually or in the aggregate,
would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in a Burdensome Condition.

Subsidiaries to afford, to Seller and any Affiliates of Seller, and their
respective counsel and accountants, during normal business hours, reasonable

information from any Governmental Entity or securities exchange or (c) the

the parties or any of their respective Affiliates under any Transaction
Agreement), other than any such Books and Records that (i) are subject to an
attorney-client or other legal privilege which, as reasonably determined by
BuyerÂ’s counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such privilege, or (ii) are
subject to an obligation of confidentiality; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
order to facilitate access to such information the parties hereto shall

 



40  use commercially reasonable efforts, including entering into a customary
joint defense agreement or common interest agreement where appropriate, to
seek to permit disclosure of such information. All requests for access or
information pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be directed to such
Person or persons as Buyer shall designate. Each of the parties hereto shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, dispose of, alter or destroy any
pre-Closing Date records related to the Business possessed or permitted to be
possessed by such Person until the latest of (a) seven years after the Closing
Date, (b) such date as may be required by such partyÂ’s standard
document retention policies and (c) 30 days after giving notice to the party

requesting party for (a) the performance by a party or its Affiliates of
their obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (b) the
inquiry, investigation, filing, submission or request for documents or
information from any Governmental Entity or securities exchange or (c)

to claims between the parties or any of their respective Affiliates under any
Transaction Agreement), other than any such pre-Closing Date records related
to the Business that (i) are subject to an attorney-client or other legal
privilege which, as reasonably determined by counsel of the party in
possession of the records, constitutes a waiver of any such privilege, or (ii)
are subject to an obligation of confidentiality; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in order to facilitate access to such information the parties hereto shall
use commercially reasonable efforts, including entering into a customary joint
defense agreement or common interest agreement where appropriate, to seek to
permit disclosure of such information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
_Section 5.5_ shall not apply to the Tax Returns and other materials covered
by _Section 9.7_.

 

(b) Before the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days from the date hereof and (ii)
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall work
together in good faith and shall use their reasonable best efforts to develop
and implement a plan that will result in the delivery or transfer, subject to
compliance with Applicable Law, of the Books and Records to Buyer (to the
extent such Books and Records are not in the possession of the Company or USIS
as of the Closing) at the Closing (or at such later time as the parties may
agree in writing) in the manner reasonably requested by Buyer, and shall take
the actions set forth in such agreed upon plan, including the delivery of the
Books and Records to Buyer. From the date hereof until the Closing or such
later time as the applicable Books and Records are transferred and delivered
to Buyer in accordance with such agreed upon plan, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, maintain such Books and Records in accordance with
Applicable Law and in substantially the same manner and with the same care
that Books and Records have been maintained prior to the date hereof. If at
any time or from time to time following the Closing, Seller or any of its
Affiliates become aware of any Books and Records in their possession or
control, they shall promptly provide to Buyer a listing of such Books and
Records and reasonably cooperate with Buyer for the prompt delivery of such
Books and Records.

release or make any such public statement without the advance approval of the
other party following such consultation (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except (i) as may be required by Applicable Law or
applicable requirements of any securities exchange, (ii) for any press release
or public statement that is substantially similar to any press release or
public statement that has been previously issued or released pursuant to the
foregoing clause (i), or (iii) any complaint, crossclaim, counterclaim or
other filing or submission with, by or to any Governmental Entity relating to

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and USIS to take all
actions as shall be necessary to cease all use of the Seller Trademarks
except as expressly permitted under _Section 5.8_, including changing all
trademark or service mark use of Seller Trademarks to marks that do not

the foregoing, Buyer may use Seller Trademarks to the extent permitted under
Applicable Law regarding Trademarks, including (i) to the extent required by
Applicable Law, including in regulatory filings, (ii) in a non-promotional
manner for historical reference to company names, products or other materials
bearing such Seller Trademarks, and (iii) in a non-promotional manner in
reference to products bearing such Seller Trademarks that were sold prior to

(c) The Company and USIS may, in the ongoing conduct of the Business, utilize
materials and assets (including stationery, forms, business cards and other
similar items) that bear the Seller Trademarks as of the Closing Date for up
to twelve (12) months following the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, so long

other writings and to take such other actions as may be reasonably necessary
or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, on and after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, take all actions and
execute any additional documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which
may be reasonably necessary to carry out any of the provisions hereof, so as
to put Buyer and its Affiliates in full possession and operating control of
the Business and to effect fully the separation of the Business from Seller,
in each case, as contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 

Section 5.10 _Officers and Directors_. Seller shall deliver to Buyer the

_Restructuring Transaction Agreements_ ").

(b) Prior to undertaking any such Restructuring Transactions, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to Buyer for its prior review
copies of all filings, submissions and correspondence relating to any

the cases of clause (i) or (ii), without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which consent may be withheld in BuyerÂ’s sole and absolute discretion.

 

(d) The parties agree to negotiate in good faith and reasonably cooperate with
each other in negotiating and finalizing the Restructuring Transaction
Agreements that are not attached as _Exhibit G_. Without limiting the
foregoing, prior to providing drafts of any such Restructuring Transaction
Agreements to any unaffiliated third party, Seller shall (i) provide to Buyer
for its prior review copies of drafts for all such agreements and (ii)
consider in good faith all reasonable comments of Buyer on such filings,

by the Transaction Agreements) without the consent of Seller, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.13 _Bank Accounts_. Seller and its Affiliates shall, if requested by

respect to transition services later requested by Buyer or its Affiliate, for
the transition period reasonably determined by Buyer) at the cost set forth
in _Annex 1.1(h)_ or, if no cost is set forth in _Annex 1.1(h)_ , at a cost
not to exceed SellerÂ’s direct, out-of-pocket cost to provide such transition
service (and which cost shall not, in any event, exceed SellerÂ’s direct, out-
of-pocket cost to provide such service to the Company and USIS as of the date
hereof and which shall not exceed a fair and reasonable cost for such
service); (ii) provide that the Company and USIS shall provide or cause to be
provided to Seller

 



44  the transition services listed in _Annex 1.1(i)_ for the transition period

timeline through which the Parties will transition the Services (as defined in
the Transition Services Agreement), including: (A) the expected phases of

of an expert to resolve such dispute. Following delivery of such notice,
Seller and Buyer shall appoint a mutually acceptable third party intellectual
technology expert who does not have (and has not had for at least three (3)
years) any business relationship with either party or any of their respective
Affiliates to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
Person is unwilling or unable to serve, or if the parties are unable to agree
on such expert within ten (10) Business Days following delivery of the
appointment notice, then, at the request of any party, JAMS shall appoint,
within ten (10) Business Days following delivery of the appointment notice or
as soon as practicable thereafter, an expert that satisfies the
foregoing qualifications, to resolve the cost dispute for purposes of this
_Section 5.14_. The determination of such expert shall be final and binding
upon the parties.

soon as practicable, after the Renewal Rights Period shall be at the sole
discretion of Buyer with respect to the transition of any coverages written by

certificates or contracts covering the lines of insurance reinsured pursuant
to the Quota Share Reinsurance Agreements in force for a period not to exceed
four (4) full policy terms following the Closing, absent cancellation or
nonrenewal for nonpayment of premium after prior consultation with Seller or
Buyer, as applicable (such period as determined by Buyer with respect to the
Company and as determined by Seller with respect to the Reinsureds,
as applicable, the " _Renewal Rights Period_ "). It being understood and
agreed by the parties that each line of insurance reinsured pursuant to the
Quota Share Reinsurance Agreements may have a particular Renewal Rights
Period.

or contracts that were issued by the Reinsureds with new policies,
certificates or contracts written by the Company and such replacement is done
mid-term and (ii) the Seller Insurer replaces policies, certificates or
contracts that were issued by the Company with new policies, certificates or
contracts written by the Seller Insurer and such replacement is done mid-term,
Buyer shall cause the Company, with respect to the policies, certificates or
contracts issued pursuant to this  _Section 5.24(j)(i)_ and Seller shall
cause the Seller Insurer, with respect to the policies, certificates or
contracts issued pursuant to this _Section 5.24(j)(ii)_, to refund premiums
on such replaced policies, certificates or contracts.

under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") for the benefit

61 Section 8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by, or an action, proceeding or investigation
instituted by, any Person not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a
party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party
must notify the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and in
reasonable detail (to the extent practicable based on the information
available to the Indemnified Party), of the Third Party Claim promptly after
such Indemnified Party is notified in writing of the Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except and to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to
give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of developments it may become aware of
with respect to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification under this Agreement for
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate
in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, subject to compliance with this
_Section 8.3(b)_, to assume, at its own expense subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 8.2_ and this _Section 8.3(b)_, the defense thereof
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. Any election by an
Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim must be
delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within ten (10)
days after receipt of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s Claims Notice, and the failure
to do so shall result in the Indemnifying Party being deemed to have elected
not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
may assume the defense of a Third Party Claim unless (i) such claim seeks any
remedy other than money damages, (ii) such claim relates to or arises in
connection with any potential claim of criminal liability or any actual or
threatened Action by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes in good faith that such claim will result in material
reputational harm to the Indemnified Party, or its Affiliates that would have
an adverse effect on the business of the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates unrelated to Losses associated with such claim and (iv) the then
remaining portion of the Indemnification Cap is reasonably expected to be less
than half of the amount claimed together with all other indemnifiable Losses
related to such Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not, as
long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of
separate counsel of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s choice for the Indemnified Party
if (A) an Indemnified Party shall have determined in good faith after
consultation with counsel that there are or may be substantive legal defenses
available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or there are or may be actual or
potential conflicts of interest between the position of an Indemnified Party
and an Indemnifying

 



62  Party which in each case makes representation by the same counsel
inappropriate or (B) the Indemnifying Party shall have authorized the
Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s
expense. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall
as long as it diligently conducts such defense, control such defense. For any
Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, subject to the limitations of
this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for
any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall
have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). In the
case of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party is not permitted
to assume pursuant to this _Section 8.3(b)_: (i) the Indemnified Party shall
conduct such claim in good faith and in a manner in which the Indemnified
Party believes is reasonable and (ii) if the Indemnified Party seeks to settle
or compromise such Third Party Claim, it shall (if permitted by Applicable
Law) consult with and consider in good faith the reasonable comments of the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party
Claim, all of the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such reasonable cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s reasonable request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees reasonably available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim and is in compliance with its obligations
under _Section 8.3(b)_ and this _Section 8.3(c)_, the Indemnified Party
shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement,
compromise or discharge of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
without the consent of any Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent can
be withheld, conditioned or delayed in the Indemnified PartyÂ’s sole and
absolute discretion if such settlement, compromise or discharge involves any
finding or admission of fault, culpability, violation of Applicable Law or
Permit or other wrongdoing, subjects any Indemnified Party to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy or encumbers any of the assets of any
Indemnified Party or results in any restriction or condition that would apply
to or affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified PartyÂ’s
business or does not provide, as a condition of such settlement, compromise,
discharge or entry of judgment, a complete and unconditional release of, or
dismissal with prejudice of claims against, any Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party, and not the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates (unless
consented to by the Indemnified Party), shall, subject to the Indemnification
Basket and Indemnification Cap, if applicable, pay or cause to be paid all
amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement or judgment (unless other timing of payment
is provided in such settlement or judgment, then in accordance with such
timing).

 



63 (d) If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification under this
Agreement for a Loss which does not result from any Third Party Claim, it
shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing, and in reasonable
detail (to the extent practicable based on the information available to the
Indemnified Party), of the claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that failure to
give such prompt notification shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except and to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

(e) The indemnities provided in this Agreement shall survive the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnities provided under  _Section
8.2(a)_ and _Section 8.2(a)_ shall terminate when the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, except as to any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall
have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim
by delivering a notice stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim
(to the extent practicable based on the information available to the
Indemnified Party) to the Indemnifying Party.

(f) The indemnities provided in _Sections 8.2(a)_ and _8.2(b)_ and, with
respect to Taxes,  _Article IX_ , shall be, in the absence of willful
misconduct, willful and material breach or fraud, the sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary damages for any breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this _Section 8.3(f)_ shall
limit any PersonÂ’s right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled pursuant to  _Section 11.11_. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ shall be
applicable to _Section 2.4_ or _Section 2.5_.

 

(g) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be calculated (i) net of any insurance proceeds actually
received from an unaffiliated third party in cash by the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Losses (net of all costs incurred in connection with
securing such proceeds, including any applicable deductibles, co-
payments, "retro premium" adjustments, prospective or increased premiums or
costs, and similar costs or payments), (ii) net of any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party (or any consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which the Indemnified Party is also a member), attributable to the
incurrence, accrual or payment of such Losses; _provided_ , that such Tax
benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the principles set forth in
_Section 9.3_.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for any punitive or exemplary damages or damages that
are not reasonably foreseeable (other than punitive or exemplary damages and
any other damages recovered by third parties in connection with a Third Party
Claim).

 

(i) The Indemnifying Party may request that the Indemnified Party take
commercially reasonable steps to assist in mitigating its Losses that are
subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , the
Indemnified Party shall not be required to take any steps that would adversely
affect its business or operations. The Indemnified Party shall, upon the prior
written request of the Indemnifying Party, use good faith commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or to cause its controlled Affiliates to take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Losses reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party provided that the

 



64  Indemnifying Party promptly reimburses the Indemnified Party for any
reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party
in providing its mitigation assistance hereunder.

(j) In the event of full payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying Party to
any Indemnified Party (including pursuant to this _Article VIII_ ) in
connection with any claim or demand by any Person other than the parties
hereto or their respective Affiliates, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnified Party as
to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnified Party may
have any right, defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against any
claimant or plaintiff asserting such claim or demand; _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall be under no obligation to commence or be a party to
any litigation or arbitration proceeding. Such Indemnified Party shall (at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party) cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost of such Indemnifying Party, in presenting
any subrogated right, defense or claim. No Seller Indemnified Party shall make
any claim for contribution from the Company or USIS with respect to any
indemnity claims arising under or in connection with this Agreement and
Seller, each on its own behalf and on behalf of all Seller Indemnified
Parties, hereby waives effective upon the Closing any such right of
contribution from the Company or USIS it has or may have in the future.

 

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
rights of the Indemnified Parties set forth in this _Article VIII_ and
_Article_ IX shall not be affected by any investigation conducted, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired), at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, and, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with,
any of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement. The
waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, or on the performance of or compliance
with any covenant, obligation or agreement set forth in this Agreement, shall
not affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based on such
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements.

(l) In the event that an Indemnifying Party: (i) consolidates with or
amalgamates, combines or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation,
amalgamation, combination or merger; or (ii) sells, transfers, pledges or
otherwise disposes of all or substantially all (measured as of its most
recent available balance sheet) of its properties or assets (whether in one
transaction or a series of related transactions) to one or more Persons, then,
in each such case, proper provision shall be made prior to the consummation of
any such transaction so that each such Person shall assume, by a written
instrument entered into for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the
Indemnifying Parties, the obligations of such Indemnifying Party set forth in
this _Article VIII_ and _Article_ IX. 

Section 8.4 _Tax Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by _Article IX_
hereof, and shall not be subject to this _Article VIII_ , except for _Section
8.2(a)(i)_, _Section 8.3(g)(ii)_,  _Section 8.3(k)_ and _Section 8.3(k)_.

 



65 ARTICLE IX

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1  _Indemnity_.

(a) From and after the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any (i) Taxes imposed on or
with respect to the Company or USIS with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) Taxes for which the Company or USIS is liable by reason of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision under
state, local or non-U.S. law), or as a transferee or successor or by contract
(other than a contract entered into in the ordinary course of the business
consistent with past practice); (iii) Taxes or Losses resulting from, based
on or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and
warranties contained in _Section 3.11_ (determined without regard to any
qualification or references to "Company Material Adverse Effect," "material,"
"materially" or other materiality qualifications or references contained in
any specific representation or warranty); (iv) Taxes resulting from, based on
or relating to any breach or failure by Seller or any of its Affiliates to
perform or comply with any of the covenants or agreements of Seller or any of
its Affiliates contained in this Agreement; (v) Transfer Taxes for which
Seller is responsible under _Section 9.8_ ; (vi) Taxes (including Transfer
Taxes) resulting from, based on or relating to the Restructuring Transactions
or any actions or transactions undertaken pursuant to _Section 5.7_ or
_Section 9.9_; and (vii) costs and expenses, including reasonable out of
pocket legal fees and expenses attributable to any item described in clauses
(i) to (vi).

(b) Except for Taxes or Losses for which Seller is responsible pursuant to
_Section 9.1(a)_, from and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any (i) Taxes
imposed on the Company or USIS with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period;
(ii) Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under _Section 9.8_; (iii)
if the representation contained in _Section 3.11(n)_ is correct and provided
that Seller complies in all material respects with the provisions contained
in _Section 9.11_, any incremental liability for Taxes attributable to an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, as contemplated by _Section
9.11_, but only to the extent the difference between the aggregate tax basis
of the assets of the Company and USIS and SellerÂ’s tax basis in the Shares
does not exceed $2,000,000; and (iv) costs and expenses, including reasonable
out of pocket legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item described in
clauses (i) to (iii).

(c) In the case of Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts (other than premiums), or (B) imposed in connection with any sale
or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided
under _Section 9.8_), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the Taxable period ended on the Closing Date;

 



66 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Company or USIS, or otherwise measured by the level of any
item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period; and

 

(iii) in the case of Taxes imposed on the basis of gross premiums, deemed
equal to the amount of Taxes that would be payable based upon the amount of
premium written as of the Closing Date;

_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller (other than the
Company or USIS) is responsible for any Taxes arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any transactions or actions taken solely by or at the direction
of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof that occur on the Closing Date but after
the Closing, and any such Taxes will be allocable to a Post-Closing Tax Period
and Buyer shall be liable for and indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any
Affiliate thereof for all such Taxes and reasonable costs or expenses related
thereto; and _provided_ , _further_ , that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period.

Section 9.2 _Returns and Payments_. Seller shall prepare and file or
otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Taxing Authority (or cause
to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or USIS for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period (and Buyer shall (or shall cause the Company) to do the
same with respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by or with respect
the Company or USIS for a Post-Closing Tax Period or, if required to be filed
after the Closing Date, a Straddle Period), and shall timely pay (or cause to
be timely paid) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company or USIS for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practices employed with respect to the Company and USIS, as
applicable, except to the extent that Buyer, the Company or USIS determines,
with the written advice of independent Tax counsel (to be delivered to Seller
as an addressee thereof), that there is not at least a "substantial
authority," within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, for a
particular position or that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed
without being subject to penalties. With respect to any Tax Return of the
Company or USIS which is to be prepared (or caused to be prepared) by Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, but which (i) could reasonably be expected
to result in an indemnity obligation of Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_
or (ii) relates to a Straddle Period, the Company shall provide Seller and its
Representatives with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement
certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is required to be
paid by Seller pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, together with appropriate
supporting information and schedules at least thirty (30) days prior to the
due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return.
Seller shall have the right to review such Tax Return, schedule and additional
information, if any, prior to the filing of such Tax Return, and Buyer shall
reflect on such Tax Return any reasonable comments submitted by

 



67  Seller at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date,
the Company and USIS) shall file an amended Tax Return, or agree to any
waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes with
respect to the Company or USIS for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 9.3 _Tax Benefits_. In determining the amount of any
payment necessary to indemnify any party hereto against, or reimburse any
party for, Losses or Taxes pursuant to this _Article IX_ , the amount of such
Losses or Taxes shall be determined net of any Tax benefit actually realized
by the Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof) as the result of
sustaining or paying such Losses or Taxes (including as the result of facts or
circumstances due to which the Indemnified Party sustained or paid such Losses
or Taxes), but only to the extent such Tax benefits result in a reduction in
Taxes paid or payable by the Indemnified Party in the taxable period during
which such Losses or Taxes are sustained or paid.

 

Section 9.4 _Tax Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to any refund, credit,
offset or other similar benefit received or realized with respect to Taxes
attributable to the Company or USIS for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, including
any such amount arising by reason of an amended Tax Return filed after the
Closing Date, an audit or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Tax
refund or other benefit (i) that relates to a carryback of a Company loss from
a Post-Closing Tax Period and that would not otherwise have been received by
Seller or an Affiliate thereof or (ii) that is specifically identified
and reserved for in the GAAP Financial Statements, shall be the property of
Buyer. Buyer shall be entitled to any Tax refund or other benefit of the
Company or USIS of or against any Taxes other than refunds or other benefits
to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the foregoing sentence. In connection
with the foregoing, if Seller reasonably determines that the Company or USIS
is entitled to file or make a formal or informal claim for a refund of Taxes
(including by filing an amended Tax Return) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Seller shall be entitled to file or make, or to request that Buyer
cause the Company or USIS, as applicable, to file or make, such formal or
informal claim for refund, and Seller shall be entitled to control of the
prosecution of such claim for refund. Buyer shall cooperate, and cause the
Company or USIS, as applicable, to cooperate, with respect to such claim for
refund (including, if applicable, with respect to the filing or making of such
claim for refund), and shall pay, or cause the Company or USIS, as
applicable, to pay, to Seller the amount (including any interest paid thereon
by the applicable Taxing Authority and net of any costs or expenses incurred
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with respect to such refund or claim for
refund) of any related refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit
thereof. Any refund, credit, offset or other similar benefit received or
realized with respect to Taxes attributable to the Company or USIS for a
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned among Buyer and Seller in a
manner consistent with the principles set forth in _Section 9.1(a)_. Each
party hereto shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the party
entitled to a Tax refund or other benefit under this _Section 9.4_, the
amount of such refund or benefit (including any interest paid thereon and net
of any Taxes to the party receiving such refund or benefit in respect of the
receipt or accrual thereof) within ten (10) days after the actual receipt or
realization thereof or the application of such Tax refund or other benefit
against amounts otherwise payable.

 

Section 9.5 _Tax Contests_.

 



68 (a) After the Closing, if any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the
party to this Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly
shall provide written notice thereof to the other party or parties to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such party to give
such prompt notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its
obligations under this _Article IX_ , except to the extent that the other
party is prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant
portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

(b) In the case of a Tax Proceeding that relates to Taxes of the Company or
USIS for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, Seller shall
have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in and control the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding in all respects;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall be entitled to participate, at its own cost and expense, in
the conduct of such Tax Proceeding; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller
shall not settle, compromise or abandon (or allow any of its Affiliates to
settle, compromise or abandon) any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the
prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement, compromise or
abandonment could have a material adverse impact on Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and USIS) for any Post-
Closing Tax Period. If Seller does not assume the defense of any Tax Claim
within fifteen (15) days of the day it is notified of such Tax Claim, Buyer
may, at its option, defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed as
to the status of such Tax Claim and, at its option, Seller may participate in
such Tax Claim at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing
and no Tax Contest shall be settled without the prior written consent of
Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.5(b), Buyer shall
have the exclusive right to control, at its own cost and expense, any Tax
Proceeding of or with respect to the Company or USIS and, for the avoidance
of doubt, Seller shall not have any liability with respect to such Tax
Proceeding. In the event of a Tax Proceeding that involves issues relating to
Taxes of the Company or USIS for which Seller is liable pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)_ that also involves separate issues relating to Taxes for which Seller
is not liable pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_, Buyer shall have the right, at
its cost and expense, to control the Tax Proceeding, but only with respect to
the latter issues. 

(c) Neither Buyer, on the one hand, nor Seller (or any of its Affiliates), on
the other hand, shall enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim
pursuant to any Tax Proceeding which would adversely affect the other party
for such year or a subsequent or prior year without first obtaining the
written consent of the other party, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.6 _Time of Payment_. Except as otherwise provided herein, payment of
any amounts due under this  _Article IX_ in respect of Taxes shall be made
within ten (10) Business Days following written notice by the Indemnified
Party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority is due;
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall comply with its obligation to
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party; and _provided_ , _further_ , that an
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to make any payment earlier than
three (3) Business Days before it is due to the appropriate Taxing Authority.
In the case of a Tax that is contested

 



69  in accordance with the provisions of _Section 9.5_, payment of the Tax to
the appropriate Taxing Authority will be considered to be due no earlier than
the date of a final determination with respect to such Tax.

Section 9.7 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement: Seller and Buyer shall provide
each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably
may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim
for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of
Taxes, participating in or conducting any Tax Proceeding in respect of Taxes
or furnishing information with respect to Taxes to parties (provided that such
parties shall have first executed a confidentiality agreement with Seller in
commercially reasonable form) subsequently desiring to purchase any of the
Company or USIS or any part of the Business from Buyer. Any party making a
request for cooperation pursuant to this _Section 9.7_ shall reimburse
the party providing such cooperation for its reasonable external out-of-
pocket expense occasioned by the provision of such cooperation. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax
Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related
work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
Taxing Authorities. Each party and its Affiliates shall make its employees
reasonably available on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to
provide explanations of any documents or information provided hereunder.
Seller and Buyer shall each retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers,
records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the
Company and USIS for each Pre-Closing Tax Period until the earlier of (i) the
expiration of the statute of limitations of the Taxable periods to which such
Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to
the extent notified in writing of such extensions for the respective Taxable
periods, or (ii) seven (7) years following the due date (without extension)
for such returns. Any information obtained under this _Section 9.7_ shall be
kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting a Tax Proceeding
or as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or applicable securities
exchange rules.

 

Section 9.8 _Transfer Taxes_. Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, shall timely pay fifty percent (50%) of any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer, and
stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and other fees, and any
similar Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") which become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any expenses related to
the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence, Seller
shall timely pay any Transfer Taxes resulting from or related to the
Restructuring Transactions. The party responsible under Applicable Law for
filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall timely file
all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes described in the preceding sentence and promptly provide a copy
of such Tax Return to the other party, and, if required by Applicable Law,
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation and
shall otherwise cooperate to enable the other to comply with any filing
requirements relating to any such Taxes.

 



70 Section 9.9 _Termination of Tax Allocation Agreements_. Any Tax allocation or
sharing agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have been
entered into by Seller or any of its Affiliates on the one hand, and the
Company or USIS, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to the Company and
USIS on or prior to the Closing Date, and no payments which are owed by or to
the Company or USIS pursuant thereto shall be made thereunder.

Section 9.10  _Miscellaneous_.

(a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat all payments made by either of them to or
for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Company or USIS)
under this _Article IX_ or under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement
as adjustments to the Closing Purchase Price, except as otherwise required
under Applicable Law.(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the indemnification obligations contained in this _Article IX_ and
the representations and warranties made pursuant to _Section 3.11_ shall
survive the Closing Date until sixty (60) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations taking into account any extension or
waivers thereof.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
indemnification for any and all Tax matters and the procedures with
respect thereto shall be governed exclusively by this _Article IX_ and shall
not be governed by the provisions of _Article VIII_ (except for _Section
8.4_).

 

(d) Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall take, or cause or permit
any other Person to take, any action which could (i) materially increase
BuyerÂ’s or any of its AffiliatesÂ’ liability for Taxes or (ii) result in, or
change the character of, any material income or gain that must be reported on
any Tax Return filed or to be filed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Tax Return filed or required to be filed by the Company or USIS
for a taxable year or period ending after the Closing Date).

 

(e) At least five (5) days prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
a certificate under Section 1445(b)(2) of the Code (a FIRPTA certificate) in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying that Seller is not a foreign person.

 

Section 9.11 _Closing Purchase Price Allocation and Section 338(h)(10)
Elections_. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall (and
shall cause their relevant Affiliates to) jointly make and timely file an
irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and to the extent
available, any corresponding elections under any applicable state and
local Tax Law) with respect to the purchase of the Shares and all of the
shares of capital stock of USIS pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the
" _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_ "). As soon as practicable following the
Closing, Buyer and Seller shall consult in good faith, acting reasonably, to
agree on an allocation of the GAAP Book Value (as reflected on the Closing
GAAP Book Value Calculation Report or, if available, the Final Closing GAAP
Book Value Calculation Report, and together with other relevant amounts,
including liabilities deemed

 



71  assumed for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among the covenants set forth
in _Section 5.16_ and the assets of the Company and USIS, as required pursuant
to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) (i) cooperate in the preparation of, and
timely file, all Tax Returns, forms, attachments and schedules necessary to
effectuate, preserve and reflect the Section 338(h)(10) Elections in a manner
consistent with the Allocation, and (ii) take no position contrary thereto on
any applicable Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding or otherwise, except to
the extent required to do otherwise pursuant to a determination as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar Tax Law. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall deliver to the other at the Closing one or more duly executed IRS Forms
8023 that reflect the Section 338(h)(10) Election.

ARTICLE X

 

TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

 

Section 10.1 _Termination of Agreement_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity which prohibits or restrains any party from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, injunction
or decree shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

(b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to February 28, 2015 (as may be extended by the proviso herein) (the "
_Outside Date_ "), unless due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to materially perform each of its obligations under this
Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing has not occurred due solely to
the failure to obtain any of the Government Approvals, either party may elect
to extend the Outside Date to April 15, 2015;

 

(c) by Seller or Buyer in writing, in the event (i) of a material breach of
this Agreement by the non-terminating party if such non-terminating party
fails to cure such breach within 20 Business Days following notification
thereof by the terminating party or (ii) the satisfaction of any condition to
the terminating partyÂ’s obligations under this Agreement becomes impossible
if the failure of such condition to be satisfied is not caused by a breach of
this Agreement by the terminating party or its Affiliates; and

 

(d) at any time on or prior to the Closing by mutual written consent of Seller
and Buyer.

 

Section 10.2 _Survival_. If this Agreement is terminated as provided in
_Section 10.1_ and the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated
as described above, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect, except for (a) the provisions of _Section 5.2_,
_Section 5.6_, this _Section 10.2_ and  _Article XI_ and (b) rights and
obligations arising from any willful and material breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination.

Section 11.4 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Ancillary Agreements, and all exhibits and schedules
hereto and thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations
and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Buyer has sufficient knowledge and

Buyer may, upon three (3) Business DaysÂ’ written notice to Seller, assign to
any Affiliate all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder

other parties hereto;  _provided_ , _further_ , that any such assignment by
Buyer to an Affiliate shall not, unless otherwise mutually agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto, relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

Section 11.7 _Dispute Resolution; Enforcement_.

 



75 (a) Subject to the dispute resolution procedures in _Section 2.4_ and 
_Section 2.5_ hereof, and _Exhibits D_ and _E_ hereto, in the event of any
dispute arising under this Agreement, prior to the commencement of litigation,
a senior officer of Buyer and a senior officer of Seller shall first attempt
to resolve the dispute amicably. If they are unable to resolve the dispute in
writing in this manner within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of a
written request by any party for such amicable settlement, the parties
may pursue judicial remedies with respect to such dispute as provided in
_Section 11.7(b)_ below.

(b) Each of Parent, Seller, Buyer Parent and Buyer hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of
the United States of America located in the City of New York (the " _New York
Federal Courts_ ") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement or, in the event
that such courts do not have jurisdiction over such Action, in the Courts of
the State of New York in the city of New York (the " _New York State Courts_
", together with the New York Federal Courts, the " _New York Courts_ "). In
any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of Seller and Buyer
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such New York Court, that
such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum
or that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this sentence shall
prohibit any party hereto from removing any matter from a New York State Court
to a New York Federal Court. Each party hereto also agrees that any final and
nonappealable judgment against a party hereto in connection with any action,
suit or other proceeding shall be conclusive and binding on such party and
that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A certified or
exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the
fact and amount of such award or judgment. The parties hereto agree that any
process or other paper to be served in connection with any action or
proceeding under this Agreement shall, if delivered, sent or mailed in
accordance with _Section 11.2_, constitute good, proper and
sufficient service thereof.

Section 11.8 _Severability; Amendment and Waiver_.

 

(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein. Upon
such holding that any provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 



76 (b) This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only by a written instrument
signed by each of the parties, and the terms hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument signed by the party waiving compliance.

(c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on
the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

Section 11.9 _Certain Limitations_. Except for the representations and
warranties expressly set forth in _Article IV_ , any certificate or instrument
delivered hereunder by Buyer and its Affiliates and any Ancillary Agreement,
(a) Parent and Seller have not relied on any representation or warranty from
Buyer Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates or Representatives in

Representatives has made any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, with regard to any information Buyer Parent, Buyer or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives made available to Parent, Seller and their
Affiliates or Representatives. Except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in _Article III_ , any certificate or instrument delivered

Agreement, (i) Buyer Parent and Buyer have not relied on any representation

of them makes or has made, and Buyer Parent and Buyer have not relied on, any
representation or warranty to Buyer Parent or Buyer, oral or written, express
or implied, other than as set forth in _Article III_. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no such Person has made any representation or
warranty to Buyer with respect to: (i) the Confidential Information
Memorandum, dated as of July 2014, as amended or supplemented from time to
time or any other evaluation materials regarding the business of the Company
and USIS provided by or on behalf of Seller to Buyer (collectively, the "

valuation or appraisal provided to Buyer by or on behalf of Seller in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except as expressly set

on behalf of Seller to Buyer, Buyer acknowledges that: (A) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such valuations, appraisals,
projections and forecasts; (B) it is familiar with such uncertainties; (C) it
is not acting and has not acted in reliance on the Descriptive Materials or
on any such valuation, appraisal, projection or forecast so furnished to it;

Descriptive Materials or any such valuation, appraisal, projection or
forecast.

Section 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

 



77 Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties hereby waive, in any
action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law
and the posting of any bond or other undertaking or security in connection
therewith. Each party further agrees that (i) by seeking any remedy provided
in this _Section 11.11_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement and (ii) nothing contained in this  _Section 11.11_ shall require
any party to institute any action for (or limit any partyÂ’s right to institute
any action for) specific performance under this _Section 11.11_ before
exercising any other right under this Agreement.

Section 11.12 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent hereby unconditionally, absolutely
and irrevocably guarantees, undertakes and promises to cause Seller to fully
and promptly pay, perform and observe all of SellerÂ’s obligations under, with
respect to, in connection with or otherwise arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (collectively, the " _Obligations_ "), whether according to the
present terms hereof, or pursuant to any change in the terms, covenants and
conditions hereof at any time hereafter made or granted, including pursuant to
any amendments, waivers, extensions or renewals affecting this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that Seller fails in any
manner whatsoever to pay, perform or observe any of the Obligations, Parent
will itself duly and promptly pay, perform or observe, as the case may be,
such Obligations, or cause the same to be duly and promptly paid, performed or
observed, in each case as if Parent were itself the Seller with respect to
such Obligations. In regards to monetary obligations, Parent agrees that its
guarantee under this _Section 11.12_ constitutes a guarantee of payment when
due and not of collection. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 11.12_
to the contrary, Buyer may proceed to enforce this  _Section 11.12_ against
Parent without first pursuing or exhausting any right or remedy that Buyer or
any of its successors or assigns may have against Seller, any of its
successors or assigns (or any Affiliates thereof) or any other Person. The
obligations of Parent under this _Section 11.12_ shall be valid and
enforceable and, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Parent
waives (i) any direct or indirect defense based on a lack of power or
authority by Seller to execute, deliver or perform this Agreement and (ii)
any other legal or equitable defense available to a guarantor under Applicable
Law. Any payment by Parent pursuant to this _Section 11.12_ will, to the
extent of actual receipt by Buyer of such payment as it relates to any
Obligation under this Agreement, discharge such Obligation of Seller to Buyer
under this Agreement. Parent agrees that its guarantee under this _Section
11.12_ shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time full or partial payment of any Obligation is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of
Seller or otherwise. Parent agrees that it shall have no right of
subrogation, contribution or indemnity with respect to payments made under
this _Section 11.12_ until such time as all Obligations have been paid in
full. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 11.1_, Parent agrees to pay
on demand all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses of Buyer
(including the reasonable, documented fees and expenses of its counsel) for
the protection or enforcement of the rights of Buyer against Parent under
this  _Section 11.12_.

Section 11.13 _Buyer Parent Guarantee_. Buyer Parent hereby unconditionally,
absolutely and irrevocably guarantees, undertakes and promises to cause Buyer

 



78  to fully and promptly pay, perform and observe all of BuyerÂ’s obligations
under, with respect to, in connection with or otherwise arising out of or
relating to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Buyer Parent Obligations_
"), whether according to the present terms hereof, or pursuant to any change
in the terms, covenants and conditions hereof at any time hereafter made or
granted, including pursuant to any amendments, waivers, extensions or
renewals affecting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event that Buyer fails in any manner whatsoever to pay, perform or observe
any of the Buyer Parent Obligations, Buyer Parent will itself duly and
promptly pay, perform or observe, as the case may be, such Buyer Parent
Obligations, or cause the same to be duly and promptly paid, performed or
observed, in each case as if Buyer Parent were itself Buyer with respect to
such Buyer Parent Obligations. In regards to monetary obligations, Buyer
Parent agrees that its guarantee under this _Section 11.13_ constitutes a
guarantee of payment when due and not of collection. Notwithstanding anything
in this  _Section 11.13_ to the contrary, Seller may proceed to enforce this
_Section 11.13_ against Buyer Parent without first pursuing or exhausting any
right or remedy that Seller or any of its successors or assigns may have
against Buyer, any of its successors or assigns (or any Affiliates thereof)
or any other Person. The obligations of Buyer Parent under this _Section
11.13_ shall be valid and enforceable and, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, Buyer Parent waives (i) any direct or indirect defense based
on a lack of power or authority by Buyer to execute, deliver or perform this
Agreement and (ii) any other legal or equitable defense available to a
guarantor under Applicable Law. Any payment by Buyer Parent pursuant to this
_Section 11.13_ will, to the extent of actual receipt by Seller of such
payment as it relates to any Buyer Parent Obligation under this Agreement,
discharge such Buyer Parent Obligation of Buyer to Seller under this
Agreement. Buyer Parent agrees that its guarantee under this _Section 11.13_
shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any
time full or partial payment of any Buyer Parent Obligation is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
of Buyer or otherwise. Buyer Parent agrees that it shall have no right of
subrogation, contribution or indemnity with respect to payments made under
this _Section 11.13_ until such time as all Buyer Parent Obligations have
been paid in full. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 11.1_, Buyer
Parent agrees to pay on demand all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses of Buyer (including the reasonable, documented fees and expenses
of its counsel) for the protection or enforcement of the rights of Seller
against Buyer Parent under this _Section 11.13_.
