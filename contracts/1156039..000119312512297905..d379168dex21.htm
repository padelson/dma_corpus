ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place on the Business Day (as defined in Section
8.14(g)) after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law (as
defined in Section 8.14(o))) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than any such conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date (as defined below), which shall be required to be so satisfied or
waived (subject to applicable Law) on the Closing Date) unless another time
or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual time and
date of the Closing being referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ "). The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Linklaters LLP, 1345 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York, unless another place is agreed to in writing by
the parties hereto.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties shall file a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is
required by and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such subsequent time as Purchaser and Company shall agree and as shall be
specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger will have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger
Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall be the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to Section 5.6, at the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Company shall be amended
and restated in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, and as
so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided by the DGCL or
therein.

Section 1.6 _Bylaws_. Subject to Section 5.6, at the Effective Time the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed
or amended as provided by the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

Section 1.7 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors
of Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall serve as directors of the
Surviving Corporation until the earliest of their death, resignation or
removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The persons designated
by the Board of Directors of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall
serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earliest of
their death, resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 



2 Section 1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Company, Purchaser, Merger
Sub or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock:

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by Purchaser or Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist and no cash, shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of
Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock
that are held by Company as treasury stock (the " _Company Treasury Shares_
"), (ii) shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Purchaser or
Merger Sub, (iii) shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by any
Subsidiary of either Company or Purchaser (other than Merger Sub) and (iv)
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive $92.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
Upon such conversion, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each Company Certificate (as defined in Section 1.10) or Book-Entry Share
(as defined in Section 1.10) shall thereafter represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by any Subsidiary of
either Company or Purchaser (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each Subsidiary owns the same percentage of
the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Each of the Company Treasury Shares shall continue to be held as shares in
the treasury of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.9 _Dissenter s Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by any Person (as defined in Section
8.14(w)) who has not voted in favor of the Merger, who is entitled to demand
and who has properly demanded in writing

 



3  appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I unless and until the holder
thereof (" _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder under Section 262 of the
DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who
otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to
dissent with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of
Company Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof. Company shall give
Purchaser (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable Law received by Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal and (b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Purchaser, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any
such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 1.10 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, or with Companys prior
approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), another bank or trust, to act as paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging certificates (the " _Company
Certificates_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") which, in either case, immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock, for the Merger
Consideration.

 

Section 1.11 _Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards_.

 

(a) Each stock option (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under the
Amerigroup Corporation 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, the Amerigroup Corporation
Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, the Amerigroup Corporation
2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amerigroup Corporation 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Plan_ ," and collectively, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ") that as of the Effective Time is outstanding and
vested by its terms (including by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), shall be cancelled and converted into the right at the
Effective Time to receive an amount (if positive), payable in cash, equal to
the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of
the amount of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded
down to the nearest cent).

 



4 (b) Each Company Stock Option that as of the Effective Time is outstanding but
unvested by its terms, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into a
stock option to acquire a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Exchange
Ratio (as defined below), at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (x) the exercise price applicable to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y)
the Equity Exchange Ratio (each, a " _Converted Option_ "). The " _Equity
Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the Merger Consideration divided by the volume-
weighted average price of the Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange Inc. (" _NYSE_ ") for the five consecutive trading days ending on the
last trading day preceding the Closing Date. The terms and conditions of the
Converted Options shall otherwise remain the same as the terms and conditions
(including vesting schedules) applicable to the Company Stock Options under
the Company Stock Plan and award agreements pursuant to which such Company
Stock Options were granted.

(c) For purposes hereof, all shares of restricted Company Common Stock,
together with all other awards of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
vesting or future issuance under any Company Stock Plan, including without
limitation stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units,
performance stock units and deferred stock awards (but not including Company
Stock Options or awards under the Company ESPP (as defined in Section
4.1(b)(ii)), shall be referred to as " _Other Stock Awards_."

 

(d) Each Other Stock Award that as of the Effective Time is outstanding and
vested by its terms (including by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an
amount, payable in cash, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Other Stock Award
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration.

(e) Each Other Stock Award that as of the Effective Time is outstanding but
unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into a right or award
with respect to a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (a " _Converted
Other Stock Award_ ") equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Other Stock Award multiplied by (ii) the
Equity Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that any fractional shares resulting from
such multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The
terms and conditions of the Converted Other Stock Award shall otherwise
remain the same as the terms and conditions (including vesting schedules)
applicable to the Other Stock Awards under the Company Stock Plan and award
agreements pursuant to which such Other Stock Awards were granted.

(f) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time but subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, the "Offering Period" within the meaning of the
Company ESPP shall terminate, shares of Company Common Stock shall be
purchased under the Company ESPP on behalf of the respective Company ESPP
participants on the same basis as if the Offering Period had expired on its
originally scheduled date but treating the Closing Date as the "Exercise Date"
within the meaning of the Company ESPP, and the shares of Company Stock so
purchased shall 

 



5  be cancelled effective as of the Effective Time and converted into a right
of each respective Company ESPP participant to receive from the Company an
amount in cash equal to (A) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock purchased on his or her behalf in accordance with this Section 1.11(f)
multiplied by (B) the Merger Consideration.

(g) At the Effective Time, all of the Converted Options and Converted Other
Stock Awards shall be assumed in full by Purchaser. From and after the
Effective Time, all references to Company in the Company Stock Plans and in
any award agreements granting Company Stock Options or Other Stock Awards
shall be deemed to refer to Purchaser. Purchaser shall take all actions with
respect to the Company Stock Plans, and the Converted Options and
Converted Other Stock Awards, that are necessary to implement the provisions
of this Section 1.11, including all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Converted Options or future issuance under the Converted
Other Stock Awards. Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
cause the registration of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to the
Converted Options or Converted Other Stock Awards to become effective as part
of a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8
is not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock subject to the Converted Options or Converted Other
Stock Awards promptly, but in any event within one (1) Business Day, following
the Effective Time; and, thereafter, Purchaser shall deliver or make available
to holders of Converted Options or Converted Other Stock Awards
any applicable prospectus and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements,
including the current status of any related prospectus, for so long as the
Converted Options or Converted Other Stock Awards remain outstanding.

(h) Company and Purchaser shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
cause the transactions contemplated hereby and any other dispositions of
equity securities of Company (including derivative securities) and
acquisitions of equity securities of Purchaser (including derivative
securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of Company or Purchaser to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended and including all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ").

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to each holder of Converted Options or Converted
Other Stock Awards an appropriate notice setting forth such holders rights
pursuant to any Company Stock Plans, after giving effect to the transactions
hereunder.

(j) Company, including the Board of Directors of Company and any committee or
administrator acting on behalf of Company or the Board of Directors of
Company, shall not hereafter take any action to accelerate the vesting or
exercisability, or otherwise amend, modify or change the terms, of any Company
Stock Options or Other Stock Awards. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee or
administrator acting on behalf of Company or the Board of Directors of
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.11.
Company shall take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure

 



6  that from and after the Effective Time neither Purchaser nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or
other capital stock of Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company Stock Options or Other Stock Awards.

(k) It is the intent of Purchaser and Company that the treatment of Company
Stock Awards contemplated in this Section 1.11 be in a manner that is
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (as defined in
Section 2.8). Any cash payment under this Section 1.11 will be subject to
applicable Tax (as defined in Section 8.14(cc)) withholdings.

Section 1.12  _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration and the
Equity Exchange Ratio and other similarly dependent terms shall be equitably
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock, Company Stock
Options and Other Stock Awards the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

ARTICLE II

 

EXCHANGE OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK

Section 2.1 _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in respect of all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any cash deposited
with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange
Fund." Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver the cash contemplated
to be paid pursuant to Section 1.8 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Purchaser shall promptly replace or
restore or shall cause the prompt replacement or restoration of the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments
required under Section 1.8(b). Nothing contained in this Section 2.1 and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (or in the case of The Depository Trust
Company on behalf of "street" holders, deliver) to each holder of record of a
Company Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as are reasonably satisfactory to both Company and Purchaser
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Company
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon

 



7  surrender of a Company Certificate to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor, and Purchaser shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the cash
amount equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Company Certificate multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Company, a check in the amount of the
aggregate Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.8 may be issued and paid with respect to such Company
Common Stock to such a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such
shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Company
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or
more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8(b)
shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" (or such other
evidence, if any, of surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Purchaser shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable the cash amount
equal to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Book-Entry
Shares.

 

Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash
paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of Article I and this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued or
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Article II, each
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration, or the right to the payment provided by Section 262
of the DGCL pursuant to Section 1.9, as applicable.

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Purchaser or otherwise on the instruction of Purchaser and any holders of the
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
and Purchaser for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 



8 Section 2.6 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest
the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser on a daily basis, or
as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Paying Agent. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to
Purchaser, or as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Paying Agent;
_provided_ that no losses on any investment made pursuant to this Section 2.6
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common
Stock entitled to receive such consideration and following any such losses,
Purchaser shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses or if for any
reason such funds are unavailable for payment to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock.

 

Section 2.7 _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.8  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation,
Purchaser and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Treasury Regulations_ "), or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, and such amounts shall be delivered, or shall be
caused to be delivered, by the Surviving Corporation, Purchaser or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable taxing authority within the
period required under applicable Law.

 

Section 2.9 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and managers of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



9 Section 2.10 _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Company shall
be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Company Certificate or
notice of Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent or Purchaser for
any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

or subsection of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of
such disclosure is reasonably apparent and that the mere inclusion of an item
in such Purchaser Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had,
would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Purchaser.

 



10 (b) _Authority; No Conflicts_.

 

(i) Purchaser has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, the Financing (as defined in

constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Purchaser, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at Law).

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser does not, and
the consummation by Purchaser of the Merger, the Financing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a
material benefit under, or the creation of a Lien (as defined in Section
8.14(p)) (other than Permitted Liens (as defined in Section 8.14(v)) on any

amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, is hereinafter
referred to as a " _Violation_ ") pursuant to: (A) any provision of the
articles of incorporation or bylaws of Purchaser or (B) except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Purchaser, and subject to obtaining or making the Consents

Consents or Orders of, and Filings with any Governmental Entity and expiry of
waiting periods the failure of which to make or obtain or expire would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

(c) _Information Supplied_.

 

(i) None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Purchaser for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the proxy statement for use
relating to the adoption by the stockholders of Company of this Agreement, or
any of the amendments or supplements thereto (collectively, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") will (except to the extent revised or superseded by amendments
or supplements contemplated hereby), on the date it is filed with the SEC,
first mailed to Company stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.1(b)), contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(c), no
representation or warranty is made by Purchaser with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information
not supplied by it or Merger Sub.

(d) _Board Approval_. The Board of Directors of Purchaser, by resolutions duly
adopted at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, has approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing and the Merger.

(f) _Available Funds_.

 

(i) Purchaser and Merger Sub have available or shall have available to them,
as of the date all of the conditions to Purchasers and Merger Subs
obligation to consummate the Merger pursuant to Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
have been satisfied, all funds necessary for the payment to the Paying Agent
of the aggregate amount of the Exchange Fund and any other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses.

 



12 (ii) Purchaser has delivered to Company true, correct and complete
fully executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of July 9, 2012,
among Purchaser, Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,
including all exhibits, disclosure schedules and amendments to such letter in
effect as of the date hereof (the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to
which, subject only to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, each
of the Financing Parties (as defined in Section 5.14(c)) has severally
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein (the provision of such funds
as set forth therein, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in such
Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in
any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of each of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge (as defined
in Section 8.14(n)) of Purchaser, the other parties thereto. There are no
conditions precedent or contingencies (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letter, the net proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together with other
financial resources of Purchaser and Merger Sub, including cash on hand and
marketable securities of Purchaser and Merger Sub, shall, in the aggregate,
be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of any amounts required to be paid
pursuant to Article II and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred in connection herewith. No event has occurred which would constitute
a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default), or the failure of any condition, on the part of
Purchaser or its Affiliates (as defined in Section 8.14(a)) under the
Commitment Letter or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party to the
Commitment Letter. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
Article VI, Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing shall not be satisfied on a timely basis on or prior to the
Closing, or that the Financing or any other funds necessary for the
satisfaction of all of Purchasers and its Affiliates obligations under this
Agreement and of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred in
connection herewith shall not be available to Purchaser on the Closing Date.
Except for fee letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with
respect to the Financing, of which Purchaser has delivered true, correct and
complete copies to Company on a confidential basis prior to the date hereof
(in a redacted form reasonably satisfactory to the Financing Parties removing
only the fee information, expense information and successful syndication
information, but which redacted information does not relate to the amounts or
conditionality of, or contain any conditions precedent to, the funding of the
Financing), there are no side letters or other agreements, Contracts (as
defined in Section 8.14(j)) or arrangements related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter and delivered to Company prior to the date hereof.
Purchaser has fully paid all commitment fees, and other amounts required to be
paid on or prior to the date hereof in connection with the Financing.

 



13 (iii) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not
be a condition to the obligation of Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) _Litigation; Compliance with Laws_.

(i) As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing,
against or affecting Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser having, or
which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, nor is there any rule or Order of any
Governmental Entity outstanding against Purchaser or any Subsidiary
of Purchaser having, or which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

(ii) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, each of Purchasers
insurance and health maintenance organization Subsidiaries (A) meets the
requirements for participation in, and receipt of payment from, the Medicare,
Medicaid and other state and federal health care programs in which each of
such Subsidiaries currently participates and (B) is a party to one or more
valid agreements with CMS authorizing its participation as a Medicare
Advantage Program contractor or Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Sponsor, or
with analogous state entities authorizing its participation as a Medicaid
managed care contractor.

(iii) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, since December 31,
2011, neither Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or employees, nor any of
Purchasers respective officers or directors with direct or indirect ownership
interests of five percent (5%) or more in Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, and
to the Knowledge of Purchaser, none of its contractors or agents, has been or
is currently suspended, excluded or debarred from contracting with the federal
or any state government or from participating in any federal or state health
care program, or is subject to an investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity that could result in such suspension, exclusion or
debarment.

 

(iv) To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there is no fact relating to its business,
operations, financial condition or legal status that would or would
reasonably be expected to: (A) prevent or prohibit the obtaining of, impose
any material delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining
any Consent or Order of or Filing with any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the Merger, the Financing and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or
(B) prohibit or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger, the Financing and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(h) _No Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its
controlled Affiliates beneficially owns directly or indirectly, an aggregate
amount in excess of four percent (4%) of outstanding Company Common Stock or
other securities convertible into, 

 



14  exchangeable for or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or any
securities of any Subsidiary of Company and neither Purchaser nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights to acquire any shares of Company Common Stock
except pursuant to this Agreement. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or other equity

set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Company to Purchaser
immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "

in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to any section of this Agreement or any
other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which the
relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent and that the mere
inclusion of an item in such Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had, would have or would reasonably be expected to have,

Person duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Company. The copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Company and of its material Subsidiaries which
were previously furnished or made available to Purchaser are true, complete
and correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date hereof. Company
has made available to Purchaser correct and complete copies of the minutes of
all meetings of (w) Company stockholders, (x) the Board of Directors of
Company, (y) each committee of the Board of Directors of Company and (z) the

are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by
Company, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens and, in the
case of Subsidiaries that are immaterial to Company, immaterial Liens) and
free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests).
Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all of the
Subsidiaries of Company, and for each such Subsidiary, the state of formation
and each jurisdiction in which each such Subsidiary is qualified or licensed

and 1,333,809 shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon settlement of
outstanding Other Stock Awards. Upon any issuance of such shares of Company
Common Stock as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, such shares of Company Common Stock will be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable, not subject to preemptive rights and free
and clear of any Lien, pledge, security interest, claim or other encumbrance.
As of the date hereof, there are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which Company is a party or by which it

of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such security,
option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or

general equity principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

 

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company does not, and the
consummation by Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby will not, conflict with, or result in a Violation pursuant to: (A) any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (B) except as would not reasonably be expected to have,

Healthcare Regulatory Approvals; and (G) such Consents or Orders of, and
Filings with any Governmental Entity and expiry of waiting periods the
failure of which to make or obtain or expire would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Company.

 

(d) _Reports and Financial Statements_.

(i) Company has filed all required registration statements, prospectuses,
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed
by it with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (collectively, as they have been
amended since the time of their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the
" _Company SEC Reports_ "). No Subsidiary of Company is required to file any
form, report, registration statement, prospectus or other document with the
SEC. None of the Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and, if

of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make

consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and

or, with respect to pro forma information, subject to the qualifications
stated therein. All of such Company SEC Reports (including any financial
statements included or incorporated by reference therein), as of
their respective dates (and as of the date of any amendment to the respective
Company SEC Report), complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities
Act_ ") and the Exchange Act.

incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2011 and (C)
for liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement, neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

representation or warranty is made by Company with respect to statements made

applies to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.1 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) Promptly following the date hereof (but in any event, no more than twenty
(20) Business Days following the date hereof), Company shall prepare and
Company shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement. Company shall promptly
notify Purchaser of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment
or supplement thereto or for additional information, and shall promptly
provide to Purchaser copies of all correspondence between Company or any
Representative of Company and the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.
Company shall (i) give Purchaser and its counsel the opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement and all responses to requests for
additional information by, and replies to comments of, the SEC (ii) take into
good faith consideration all comments reasonably proposed by Purchaser and
(iii) not file such document with the SEC prior to providing Purchaser and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Each of
Company and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts after
consultation with the other party hereto, to respond promptly to all such
comments of and requests by the SEC. Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after its filing and thereafter cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable (but no more than twenty (20) Business Days) after the Proxy
Statement has been declared effective by the SEC. Each of Company and
Purchaser shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries
to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Purchaser agrees
that it shall cooperate with and assist Company, including providing Company
upon request (as promptly as reasonably practicable) with the information
concerning Purchaser and its Affiliates, directors and officers required to be
included in the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to Company or Purchaser or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
Company or Purchaser that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

 



39  fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed with the SEC, and to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Company. Company shall
have responsibility for the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, mailing and filing of the Proxy Statement and the solicitation of
the approval of the stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to and in
accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and subject to
this Section 5.1, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but no more than forty (40) days) following the date
on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to Company stockholders, a meeting of
the holders of Company Common Stock (the __" _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of voting to adopt this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Company shall be permitted to adjourn, delay or postpone convening the
Company Stockholders Meeting if in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Company (after consultation with its outside legal advisors) the
failure to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting could
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors of Company under applicable Law or not allow sufficient
time under applicable Law for the distribution of any required or appropriate
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement. Subject to this Section 5.1,
the Board of Directors of Company shall declare that this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the
best interests of Company and the stockholders of Company and subject to this
Section 5.1, recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
Company (the __" _Company Recommendation_ ") and subject to this Section 5.1,
include in the Proxy Statement such Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to compliance with this
Section 5.1 and Section 5.4, prior to receipt of the Required Company Vote,
the Board of Directors of Company may, in response to any proposal or offer
for an Alternative Transaction (as defined in Section 8.14(b)), (i) withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify (or publicly propose to or publicly state that it
intends to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify) in any manner adverse to
Purchaser the Company Recommendation (it being understood that publicly taking
a neutral position or no position with respect to the Alternative Transaction
shall be considered a modification to the Company Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Purchaser), (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, any proposal or offer for an Alternative
Transaction (any action in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, a __" _Change in
Company Recommendation_ "), and subject to compliance with this Section 5.1(b)
and Section 7.1(h), terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a binding
agreement providing for a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 8.14(bb)),
if: (A) the Board of Directors of Company reasonably determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside counsel
that such proposal or offer for an Alternative Transaction constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (B) the Board of Directors of Company reasonably determines
in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel that the failure to
take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law, (C)

 



40  the Board of Directors of Company, before effecting a Change in Company
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement as provided above, gives
Purchaser three (3) Business Days prior written notice (unless at the time
such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case Company
shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable) of its intention
to do so (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by Company
nor any public announcement thereof that Company determines it is required to
make under applicable Law shall constitute a Change in Company Recommendation
unless and until the Company shall have failed at or prior to the end of the
period referred to in clause (D) (and, upon the occurrence of such failure,
such notice and such public announcement shall constitute a Change in Company
Recommendation) to publicly announce that it (I) is recommending this
Agreement and (II) has determined that such other Alternative Transaction
(taking into account in (I) any modifications or adjustments made to this
Agreement to which Parent has agreed in writing and in (II) any modifications
or adjustments made to such other Alternative Transaction) is not a Superior
Proposal and has publicly rejected such Alternative Transaction), (D) during
such three (3) Business Day period (or such shorter period as specified
below), Company, if requested by Purchaser, shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with Purchaser (including by making its officers and its
financial and legal advisors reasonably available to negotiate) regarding any
amendments to this Agreement proposed in writing by Purchaser in response to
such Superior Proposal and (E) at the end of the period described in the
foregoing clause (D), the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement to which Purchaser has agreed in writing), that
such proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make a Change in Company Recommendation or the failure to terminate this
Agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law. Any material
amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
proposal for purposes of this Section 5.1(b); _provided, however,_ that in the
event the Company seeks to make a Change in Company Recommendation as
provided above, the notice period and the period during which the Company and
its Representatives are required to negotiate, if requested by Purchaser, with
Purchaser regarding any amendments to the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by Purchaser in response to such new proposal pursuant to clause (D)
above shall expire on the later to occur of (x) two (2) Business Days after
Company provides written notice of such new proposal to Purchaser and (y) the
end of the original three (3) Business Day period described in clause (D)
above. The parties agree that nothing in this Section 5.1(b) shall in any way
limit or otherwise affect Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at such time as the requirements of such subsection
have been met.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company from (i) taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (including any "stop, look
and listen" communication to the stockholders of Company) or (ii) making any
required disclosure to the stockholders of Company if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Company (after receiving the advice of
its outside counsel), failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors
of Company to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law or (iii)
informing any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 5.1 or Section 5.4.

 



41 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of
Directors of Company, based on events, developments or occurrences that arise
after the date hereof that were not known to the Board of Directors of Company
prior to the date hereof (or if known, the consequences of which were not
known or reasonably foreseeable) (in each case other than involving or
relating to an Alternative Transaction), from effecting a Change in Company
Recommendation if the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law, provided that (x) Company
shall (A) promptly notify Purchaser in writing of its intention to take such
action, which notice includes a description in reasonable detail of the nature
of such event, development or occurrence prompting the Change in Company
Recommendation (it being understood that such notice shall not be deemed to be
or constitute a Change in Company Recommendation) and (B) negotiate in good
faith with Purchaser for three (3) Business Days following such notice
regarding revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser in
writing in response to such event, development or occurrence, and (y) the
Board of Directors of Company shall not effect any Change in Company
Recommendation unless, after the three (3) Business Day period described in
the foregoing clause (B), the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law.

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the Representatives of Purchaser reasonable access
during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time,
to such of its properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records, officers
and employees as Purchaser may reasonably request and, during such period,
shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish as promptly
as reasonably practicable to Purchaser consistent with its legal obligations
and obligations pursuant to Contracts, all other information concerning
Company and Companys business, properties and personnel as Purchaser may
reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Company may restrict the
foregoing access to the extent that any applicable Law, treaty, rule or
regulation requires such party to restrict access to any properties or
information and that Purchaser shall not have access to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information that
in the reasonable opinion of Company is sensitive or the disclosure of which
could reasonably be expected to subject it or any of its Subsidiaries to risk
of liability or information that is subject to attorney-client privilege;
_provided, further_ , that Company may restrict the foregoing access to those
Persons who have entered into or are bound by a confidentiality agreement
with it and to the extent required by applicable Law or Contract to which
Company or its Subsidiaries is a party. All such access shall be subject to
reasonable restrictions imposed from time to time with respect to the
provision of privileged communications or any applicable confidentiality
agreement with any Person. In conducting any inspection of any properties of
Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser and its Representatives shall not (i)
unreasonably interfere with the business conducted at such property or (ii)
damage any property or any portion thereof. Prior to the Effective Time,
Purchaser and its Representatives shall not have the right to conduct
environmental testing or sampling at any of the facilities or properties of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Purchaser will hold any such information
obtained pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)

 



42  that is non-public in confidence to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the provisions of that certain Mutual Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated April 23, 2012, between Purchaser and Company (the __"
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Company and its Subsidiaries shall afford
Purchaser reasonable access to its key employees for the purpose of discussing

after the Effective Time.

shall be the level of, and shall be measured as to, what would be reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and not the level or measure of what would be reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on Purchaser and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and (III) the effect shall be with respect to Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries) or (B) would, or would be reasonably likely to materially
impair the benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Purchaser from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (to the
extent not mitigated through the resolution process set forth in Section
5.3(d) below, each of (A) and (B) above, a " _Burdensome Term or Condition_
"); _provided_ that (x) any obligation, restriction, requirement, limitation,
qualification, condition, remedy or other action required by a United States
federal Governmental Entity relating to Consents required to be obtained
under the HSR Act and any other United States federal Antitrust Laws or in
connection with the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other United States federal Antitrust Law shall be
deemed not to constitute and shall not be taken into account in determining
whether a Burdensome Term or Condition shall have been imposed, compelled,
required or requested and (y) in determining whether a Burdensome Term or
Condition shall have been imposed, compelled, required or requested, neither
Company nor Purchaser shall take into account effects resulting from or
arising out of changes in the business plans or operations of (1) Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries that have a material effect on Purchasers or its
Subsidiaries ability to satisfy or comply with any obligation, restriction,
requirement, request, limitation, qualification, condition, remedy or other
action of any Governmental Entity required or requested in connection with
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (2)
Company or its Subsidiaries, which in any case under clause (1) or (2), are
proposed or agreed to by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to be effective on and
after the Merger, but not changes in the business plans or operations imposed,
compelled, required or requested by a Governmental Entity whose approval is
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Prior to Purchaser being entitled to invoke the actual or potential
imposition of a Burdensome Term or Condition, Purchaser shall meet with
Company in order to: (i) exchange and review Purchasers and Companys views
as to such obligation, restriction, requirement, request, limitation,
qualification, condition, remedy or other action; and (ii) discuss any
potential approaches that would avoid such obligation, restriction,
requirement, request, limitation, qualification, condition, remedy or other
action or mitigate its impact.

 

(e) Neither Company nor Purchaser shall, and each of them shall cause its
Affiliates not to directly or indirectly, enter into, amend or terminate any
Contract, acquire, purchase, lease or license (or agree to acquire, purchase,
lease or license), by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any
other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership, association or
other business organization or division or part thereof, or any securities or
collection of assets, if doing so would or would reasonably be expected to:
(i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or

 



45  materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any Consent of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws; (ii)
materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an Order
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not
being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) prohibit
or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties shall as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof make all Filings with all Governmental
Entities that may be or may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) not
later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date hereof, Purchaser
filing, or causing to be filed, "Form A Statements" or similar change of
control applications, with the insurance commissioners or departments of
health in each jurisdiction where required by applicable insurance Law or
Health Care Law seeking approval of Purchasers acquisition of control of each
of the Company Regulated Subsidiaries which results from the Merger; (ii) not
later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date hereof, Purchaser

transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) not later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date hereof, Company and Purchaser each making an appropriate
Filing of a notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and requesting early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act; (iv) Company and Purchaser each making any
other Filing that may be required under any other Antitrust Laws or by any
Antitrust Authority (as defined in Section 8.14(c)); (v) not later than sixty
(60) days prior to the Closing, Company and Purchaser filing any required

each promptly making any other Filing that may be required under any Health
Care Laws or insurance or other applicable Laws or by any Governmental Entity
with jurisdiction over enforcement of any such Law.

(g) Company and Purchaser shall, as promptly as practicable, (i) upon the
reasonable request of the other party, furnish to such party and upon any
request from a Governmental Entity, furnish to such Governmental Entity, any
information or documentation concerning themselves, their Affiliates,
directors, officers, securityholders and Financing Parties, information or
documentation concerning the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and such other matters as may be requested and (ii) make
available their respective personnel and advisers to each other and, upon
request, any Governmental Entity, in connection with (A) the preparation of
any Filing made by or on their behalf to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
(B) any review or approval process.

 



46 (h) Subject to applicable Law relating to the sharing of information, each of
Company and Purchaser shall promptly notify the other of any Filing,
communication or inquiry it or any of its Affiliates intends to make with or
receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement, and prior to submitting any Filing, substantive
written communication, correspondence or other information or response by such
party or any or its Representatives, on the one hand, to any Governmental
Entity, or members of the staff of any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand, subject to Section 5.2, the submitting party shall permit the other
party and its counsel the opportunity to review as reasonably in advance as
practicable under the circumstances, and consider in good faith the comments
of the other party in connection with any such Filing, communication or
inquiry. Subject to Section 5.2 and the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Company and Purchaser shall coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing (including in seeking early termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act). Each such party shall promptly inform the
other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of
written communications with, any Governmental Entity regarding any Filing.
None of the parties hereto shall agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity, or any member
of the staff of any Governmental Entity, in respect of any Filing, proceeding,
investigation (including any settlement of the investigation), litigation, or
other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, allows the other party to
participate. Neither party shall be required to comply with any of the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3(h) to the extent that such
compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law. The parties further covenant
and agree not to voluntarily extend any waiting period associated with any
Consent of any Governmental Entity (including under the HSR Act) or
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity or other third party
not to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except with the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Purchaser
shall have responsibility for the filing fees associated with its "Form A
Statements" or similar change of control applications and its "Form E" or
similar market share notifications.

 

(i) Each of Company and Purchaser may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this Section 5.3 as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and, subject to any additional
confidentiality or joint defense agreement the parties may mutually propose
and enter into, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Company or Purchaser, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.3, materials provided to the other party or its outside counsel
may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning valuation, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns and (iv) to remove references concerning pricing and other
competitively sensitive terms from an antitrust perspective in the Contracts
of Company, Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries.

(j) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall (i)
Purchaser or its Affiliates or Company or its Affiliates be required to agree
to take or enter into 

 



47  any action which is not conditioned upon the Closing or (ii) without
limiting the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this Section 5.3,
Company or its Affiliates agree to any obligation, restriction, requirement,
limitation, qualification, condition, remedy or other action relating to
Consents required to be obtained by the parties or their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger without the prior written consent
of Purchaser; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing (i) it is
understood and agreed that any failure by Company or its Affiliates to agree
to any such obligation, restriction, requirement, limitation, qualification,
condition, remedy or other action by reason of Purchasers withholding its
written consent from Company or its Affiliates to do so shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 5.3 by Company and its Affiliates and (ii) Purchaser
shall be required to provide its written consent to Company or its Affiliates
agreeing to any such obligation, restriction, requirement, limitation,
qualification, condition, remedy or other action to the extent it would
not, individually, or together with any other such obligation, restriction,
requirement, limitation, qualification, condition, remedy or other action,
impose a Burdensome Term or Condition.

 

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. Company agrees that, from the
date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and its Subsidiaries Representatives retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, or furnish or disclose non-
public information in furtherance of, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any proposal or offer with respect to any Alternative Transaction, or
negotiate or engage in discussions with any Person (other than Purchaser,
Merger Sub or their respective Representatives) with respect to any
Alternative Transaction; _provided_ that, Company and its Representatives may
contact any Person making such proposal and its Representatives to ascertain
facts or clarify terms and conditions for the sole purpose of the Board of
Directors of Company informing itself about such proposal and the Person
that made it, and at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
Companys stockholders (and in no event after the adoption of this Agreement
by Companys stockholders), Company may furnish information to, and negotiate
or engage in discussions with, any party who delivers a bona fide written
proposal for an Alternative Transaction which was made and not solicited,
initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated by Company or its
Representatives after the date hereof, if and so long as the Board of
Directors of Company reasonably determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside counsel that the failure to provide such information or
engage in such negotiations or discussions is reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Company
under applicable Law and reasonably determines in good faith that such
proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal. Company
shall notify Purchaser promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) of any
such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, or any such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives, indicating
the name of such Person and providing to Purchaser a summary of the material
terms of such proposal or offer for an Alternative Transaction. Prior to
providing any information or data to, or entering into any negotiations or
discussions with, any Person, or making any such recommendation, in connection
with a proposal or offer for an Alternative Transaction, Company shall receive
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms and
provisions at least as restrictive to Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood, however, that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain any obligation precluding
discussions or 

 



48  negotiations relating to the proposal or offer from such Person and shall
not contain any provision that requires exclusive negotiations with such
Person). Company agrees that it will keep Purchaser informed, on a prompt
basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers and
the status of any material developments in respect of any such discussions or
negotiations and that it will deliver to Purchaser a summary of any material
changes to any such proposals or offers and all nonpublic information being
furnished to such Person that was not previously provided to Purchaser. On the
date hereof, Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Third Parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail
to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which it is a party if the Board of Directors of Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of Company under applicable Law and if Company
terminates, similarly amends, waives, fails to enforce or similarly modifies
the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.5 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) From the Effective Time until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide to those employees of
Company or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who
continue as employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) after the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_
") compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar
to or no less favorable than either (i) those provided to the employees of
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (to the extent disclosed
on Schedule 3.2(w)(i)) or (ii) those generally provided to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser. Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of
employment for any employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
than as provided in any applicable employment agreement or other Contract, to
restrict the right of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the
employment of any such employee.

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Continuing
Employees first become eligible to participate at or after the Effective Time
(the " _New Company Plans_ "), Purchaser shall: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to employees of Company or its Subsidiaries
under any health and welfare New Company Plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time and cause deductibles,
coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by such employees during
the applicable plan year in which such employee first participates in the
applicable New Company Plan to reduce the amount of deductibles, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket payments under the New Company Plans to the extent
taken account under the corresponding Company Plan in respect of the same
plan year; and (ii) recognize service credited by Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate and
vesting credit (and, for purposes of severance and paid time off only, for
purposes of determining the amount or level of benefit) in any New Company
Plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any credit be
given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the
same period of service.

 



49 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i)
be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan or (ii)
limit the right of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company Plan
following the Closing Date or to terminate any employee, (iii) confer upon
any Person whether or not a party to this Agreement any right to employment,
any right to compensation or benefits, or any other right of any kind or
nature whatsoever.

 

(d) To the extent reasonably practicable, Company and Purchaser shall consult
with each other prior to any material communications to employees or
participants in the Company Plans regarding the impact of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on Companys compensation and benefit programs.

Section 5.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, the present and former directors, officers and employees of
Company and its Subsidiaries (each such director, officer or employee an "
_Indemnified Person_ "), in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any amendments to
or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date hereof that increase the
extent to which a corporation may indemnify its officers and directors or any
Indemnified Person, from and against any and all costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or
investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any
circumstances, developments or matters in existence, or acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the Effective Time (including
for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement, the performance of Companys obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or arising out of or
pertaining to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby)
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at no expense to the
beneficiaries, purchase as of the Effective Time a tail policy to the current
policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Company
which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time
through and including the date six (6) years after the Closing Date (a "
_Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, and which tail policy
shall contain coverage and amounts at least as favorable to the Indemnified
Persons as the coverage currently provided by Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance policies (in the aggregate); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend, for the entire tail policy, in excess of 300 per cent of the annual
premium

 



50  currently paid by Company for its current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance (in the aggregate) (which premiums are hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to currently be approximately
$2,000,000 per annum); and, _provided_ , _further_ that, if the premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation after
consultation with Company shall be obligated to obtain a policy or policies
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. To
the extent purchased after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
such insurance policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with
such insurance carriers as may be specified by Purchaser and as are
reasonably acceptable to Company; _provided_ that such insurance carrier has
at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance. Subject to
both the proviso in the first sentence and to the second sentence of this
Section 5.6(b), Company shall be permitted at its sole and exclusive option to
purchase, after reasonable consultation with Purchaser, the Reporting Tail
Endorsement (in lieu of the Surviving Corporation) prior to the Effective
Time.

(c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of
expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Persons on the same basis as set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Company in effect on
the date hereof. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing
for indemnification, advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation
of Indemnified Persons, as applicable, with respect to the facts
or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions
shall not be amended except as required by applicable Law or except to make
changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the
Indemnified Persons indemnification rights thereunder.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation shall not, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or
terminate the advancement and reimbursement of expenses, exculpation,
indemnification provisions of the agreements listed in Section 5.6(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule between Company or any Subsidiary and any of the
Indemnified Persons, or any such provisions contained in the Surviving
Corporation certificate of incorporation or bylaws to the extent
such provisions apply to Indemnified Persons.

(e) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 5.6, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve
the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified
Person if such failure does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such
Indemnified Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expense subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Persons in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
elects not to assume such defense or counsel or the Indemnified
Persons advise that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
between

 



51  Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons, the
Indemnified Persons may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Purchaser
shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (e) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction, (ii) the
Indemnified Persons will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii)
neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
further, that neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Person
in the manner contemplated by paragraph (a) of Section 5.6 is prohibited by
applicable Law.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Persons on or prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
Section 5.6 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(g) The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the
irrevocable benefit of and to grant third-party rights to, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs
and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
Contract or otherwise and shall be binding on all successors and assigns
of Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation. The obligations of Purchaser
under this Section 5.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as
to adversely affect any Indemnified Person unless the affected Indemnified
Person shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification.
It is expressly agreed that each Indemnified Person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Section 5.6, and entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 5.6. If any Indemnified Person makes any claim for
indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 5.6 that is
denied by Purchaser and/or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person is entitled to such
indemnification, then Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such
Indemnified Persons reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable legal
fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against
Purchaser and/or the Surviving Corporation. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons under this Section 5.6 shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any rights such Indemnified Persons may have under the
certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Company, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of
Companys Subsidiaries or the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies
or Laws and Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(h) In the event that Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)

 



52  transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, Purchaser shall cause proper
provision to be made prior to consummation of any transaction of the type
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence so that the successors or
assigns of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Company or any of its
respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or other Indemnified Person, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.6 is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall use
reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to Company, to the extent that
either party (a) receives, to the Knowledge of Company, in case of notices
or communications received by Company or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, in
the case of notices or communications received by Purchaser, any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging
that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such Consent
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Company or a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser,
(b) acquires actual knowledge of any matter (including a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement)
that would reasonably be expected to lead to the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions to Closing in Article VI and (c) acquires actual knowledge of any
action, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case which
relates to the Merger, the Financing or the other transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Section 5.7(b) (to
the extent Section 5.7(b) relates to any breach of a representation or
warranty of Company or Purchaser, as applicable) and Section 5.7(c) shall not
constitute a covenant or agreement for purposes of Section 6.2(b) and 6.3(b).

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Purchaser and Company shall develop a
joint communications plan and each party shall (a) ensure that all press
releases and other public statements and communications (including any
communications that would require a filing under Rule 14a-12 of the Exchange
Act) with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan and (b) unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, Purchaser
and Company shall consult with each other for a reasonable time before issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public statement or communication
(including any communication that would require a filing under Rule 14a-12 of
the Exchange Act), and Purchaser and Company shall mutually agree upon any
such press release or public statement or communication, with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the
foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in the Proxy Statement in accordance
with the provisions of Section 5.1, neither Purchaser nor

 



53  Company shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement
or disclosure concerning the other party or the other partys business,
financial condition or results of operations without the consent of the other
party. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.8 shall not apply to any release or public statement
made or proposed to be made by Company in accordance with Section 5.4 or in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.9 _Transition Team_. Promptly following execution of this Agreement,
the parties shall establish a transition planning team (the " _Transition
Team_ ") comprised of an equal number of Representatives of Purchaser and
Company. Subject to applicable Law, the Transition Team shall be responsible
for facilitating a transition and integration planning process to facilitate
the successful combination of the operations of Purchaser and Company.
Subject to applicable Law, the Transition Team shall be responsible for
developing, and monitoring the development of, and deliverables due under, an
action plan for the combination of the businesses. This Section 5.9 shall not
constitute a covenant or agreement for purposes of Section 6.2(b) or Section
6.3(b).

Section 5.10  _Takeover Statutes_. Company and Purchaser shall each use
reasonable best efforts to, if any takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation of any state becomes or may become applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.11 _Withholding Certificate_. Immediately prior to Closing, Company
shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate, substantially in the form provided
for in Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations,
establishing that the Company is not a "United States real property holding
corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, and has not
been such a United States real property holding corporation within the five
(5) year period ending on the Closing Date.

Section 5.12 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with the
others in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the
Company Common Stock from the NYSE and terminate its registration under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall not be
effective until after the Effective Time.

Section 5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. Company shall promptly advise
Purchaser orally and in writing of any stockholder litigation against Company
and/or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger and/or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Purchaser fully
informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. Company shall give
Purchaser the opportunity to consult with Company regarding the defense or
settlement of any such stockholder litigation, shall give due consideration to
Purchasers advice with respect to such stockholder litigation and shall not
settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration,
_provided, however_ , that Company will not, without Purchasers prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle
any such stockholder litigation.

 



54 Section 5.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Purchaser shall and shall cause its Affiliates to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Financing or any Substitute Financing
(as defined below) as promptly as possible following the date hereof,
including, (i) complying with and maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letter, (ii) negotiating and entering into definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing including the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter so that such agreements are in effect no later than the
Closing, (iii) satisfying as soon as possible and on a timely basis all the
conditions to the Financing and the definitive agreements related thereto,
(iv) accepting to the fullest extent all "market flex" contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (or any fee letter relating thereto) and (v) enforcing its
rights under the Commitment Letter in the event of a breach by the Financing
Parties that could reasonably be expected to impede or delay Closing. In the
event that all conditions to the Commitment Letter have been satisfied or,
upon funding shall be satisfied, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their
best efforts to cause the Financing Parties to fund on the Closing Date the
Financing, to the extent the proceeds thereof are required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including by taking
enforcement action to cause the Financing Parties to fund such Financing).
Purchaser shall, after obtaining Knowledge thereof, give Company prompt
written notice of any (A) breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any breach or default) by a Financing Party or any
party to any definitive document related to the Financing, (B) actual or
threatened withdrawal, repudiation or termination of the Financing by the
Financing Parties, (C) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the
Financing, (D) amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the Commitment
Letter or any related fee letters or (E) change, circumstance or event which
causes Purchaser or Merger Sub to believe that it will not be able to timely
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the Financing Parties or sources contemplated by the definitive documents
related to the Financing. Purchaser shall keep Company informed on
a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, including providing copies of
all definitive agreements related to the Financing. Other than as permitted
pursuant to the immediately following sentence, neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates shall materially amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any
waiver under the Commitment Letter or any related fee letters without the
prior written approval of Company that would (I) reduce the aggregate amount
of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount) or (II) impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Financing, or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Commitment Letter
or the related fee letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
(1) delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (2)
adversely impact the ability of Purchaser or Merger Sub, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the Financing Parties or any other parties to the
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall be permitted to reduce the
amount of Financing by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds 

 



55  received by Purchaser from any offering of (i) debt or equity securities
issued by Purchaser or (ii) syndicated term loans of or guaranteed by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing Date (provided that the funding of the Merger
Consideration is described as a use of proceeds in any prospectus or term loan
agreement, as applicable, related to such offering) (" _Offering Proceed_ "),
provided that Purchaser shall not reduce the Financing to an amount committed
below the amount that is required, together with the financial resources of
Purchaser and Merger Sub, including cash on hand and marketable securities of
Purchaser, Company and their respective Subsidiaries that are committed to
fund the Merger Consideration, to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and provided, further, that such reduction
shall not (A) expand upon or amend in any way that is adverse to the Company
the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment
Letter or (B) prevent or materially impede or materially delay the
availability of the Financing and/or the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that new commitment
letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Commitment Letter permitted pursuant
to this Section 5.14, such new commitment letters shall be deemed to be a part
of the "Financing" and deemed to be the "Commitment Letter" for all purposes
of this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Company copies of any
termination, amendment, modification, waiver or replacement of the Commitment
Letter or any fee letters. If funds in the amounts set forth in the Commitment
Letter, or any portion thereof, become unavailable, or it becomes reasonably
likely that such funds may become unavailable to Purchaser on the terms and
conditions set forth therein, in each case, other than as a result of receipt
of Offering Proceeds, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event to (x) notify
Company in writing thereof, (y) obtain substitute financing (on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable to Purchaser and Merger
Sub, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in the
Commitment Letter, taking into account any "market flex" provisions thereof)
sufficient to enable Purchaser to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its terms (the "
_Substitute Financing_ ") and (z) obtain a new financing commitment letter
that provides for such Substitute Financing and, promptly after execution
thereof, deliver to Company true, complete and correct copies of the new
commitment letter and the related fee letters (in redacted form reasonably
satisfactory to the Persons providing such Substitute Financing removing only
the fee information, expense information and successful syndication
information) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
Substitute Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute
Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Financing" and
any commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the
"Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall enter into, or
agree to enter into, any new commitments for any financing that would result
in a reduction of the commitments set forth in the Commitment Letter unless
the conditions precedent of such new commitments are not materially
less favorable to Purchaser and its Affiliates than the conditions precedent
set forth in the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that Purchasers and Merger Subs
obligations hereunder are not conditioned in any manner upon Purchaser or
Merger Sub obtaining the

 



56  Financing, any Substitute Financing or any other financing. Purchasers
breach of any of its representations or warranties in Section 3.1(f),
Purchasers or Merger Subs breach of any of their respective obligations in
this Section 5.14, the failure, for any reason, of Purchaser and Merger Sub to
have sufficient cash available on the Closing Date to pay the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Article II hereof (and any other amounts
that may have to be paid pursuant to Section 1.11) and/or the failure to so
pay the Merger Consideration on the Closing Date, in each case, shall
constitute a willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by Purchaser
and Merger Sub.

(c) For the period from the date hereof and the Closing, Company shall provide
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of its
Representatives, including legal, tax, regulatory and accounting, to provide,
all cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with the
Financing ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Company and its Subsidiaries),
including (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable providing information
(financial or otherwise) relating to Company to the Persons providing the
Financing (the " _Financing Parties_ ") (including information to be used in
the preparation of an information package regarding the business, operations,
financial projections and prospects of Purchaser and Company customary or
reasonably necessary for the completion of such Financing) to the extent
reasonably requested by Purchaser to assist in preparation of customary
offering or information documents to be used for the completion of the
Financing, (ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including
customary one-on-one meetings with the lead arrangers for such Financing),
presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions
(including accounting) and sessions with the rating agencies at times and at
locations reasonably acceptable to Company, (iii) reasonably assisting in the
preparation of (A) any customary offering documents, bank information
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents, which contain, to the extent
reasonably available, all financial statements and other data required to be
included therein, and all other data (including selected financial data) that
the SEC would require in a registered offering or that would be necessary for
an investment bank to receive customary "comfort" (including "negative
assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with a
registered offering and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts for the Financing, (v)
providing customary authorization letters to the Financing Parties authorizing
the distribution of information to prospective lenders and containing a
representation to the Financing Parties that the public side versions of such
documents, if any, do not include material non-public information about
Company or their respective Affiliates or securities, (vi) providing
audited financial statements of Company covering the three (3) fiscal years
of Company ended at least seventy-five (75) days prior to the Closing Date,
unaudited financial statements (excluding footnotes) for any fiscal quarter of
Company ended after the date of the most recent audited financial statements
and at least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date, in each case to
the extent then available, and (vii) cooperating reasonably with Financing
Parties due diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable and to the
extent not unreasonably interfering with the business of Company; _provided_
that until the Closing occurs, Company shall (A) have no liability or any
obligation under any agreement or document related to the Financing or (B)
not be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Financing
unless simultaneously reimbursed or reasonably satisfactorily indemnified by
Purchaser. Parent shall, promptly upon request by Company, reimburse Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs

 



57  and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 5.14 (without duplication of any
reimbursement pursuant to the preceding sentence). Parent and Merger Sub
shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including
attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred in connection with any Financing or other securities offering
of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries or any assistance or activities provided in
connection therewith.

(d) Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due
and payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable prior to
the Closing Date under the Commitment Letter or the related fee letters,
including without limitation the fees described in the fee letter dated July
9, 2012 among Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and
Purchaser.

(e) Purchaser shall not permit the borrowing availability under that certain
credit agreement, dated as of September 30, 2010, among Purchaser, Bank of
America N.A. and certain other parties thereto (as amended, restated,
supplemented, extended or replaced from time to time, the " _Existing Credit
Agreement_ ") to be less than $1,300,000,000 at any time prior to the Closing.
Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that the
Existing Credit Agreement remains in full force and effect and shall not
enter into or permit any amendments, waivers or other modifications to the
Existing Credit Agreement that would reasonably be likely to (i) cause the
revolving loans under the Existing Credit Agreement to be unavailable to
Purchaser on the Closing Date or (ii) result in the borrowing availability
under the Existing Credit Agreement being less than $1,300,000,000 at any time
on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser shall be permitted to reduce such borrowing
availability by an amount equal to any Offering Proceeds received by Purchaser
in excess of those required to reduce the amount of the Financing commitments
to zero, provided that Purchaser shall not reduce such borrowing availability
to an amount below the amount that is required, together with the financial
resources of Purchaser and Merger Sub, including cash on hand and marketable
securities of Purchaser, Company and their respective Subsidiaries that are
committed to fund the Merger Consideration, to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

under Section 5.3 or Section 5.14.

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

whether before or after the approval by the stockholders of Company referred
to in Section 5.1(b):

(b) By Purchaser or Company, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on
or before June 9, 2013 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if on June 9, 2013 one or more of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Sections 6.1(a) or 6.1(b) shall have not been satisfied
or duly waived by the party entitled to the benefit of such condition but all
other conditions to Closing have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, shall be capable of
being satisfied on June 9, 2013), then the Initial Outside Date shall, at the
option of Purchaser or Company, be extended to and including September 9, 2013
(as so extended, the " _Outside Date_ "), if Purchaser or Company notifies
the other party in writing on or prior to June 9, 2013 of its election to so
extend the Initial Outside Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the right
to extend the Initial Outside Date or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party if such partys action
or failure to act has been the principal cause of or resulted in (i) the
failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party

of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of
Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or any representation or
warranty of Purchaser or Merger Sub shall have become untrue after the date
hereof, which breach or untrue representation or warranty (i) would,
individually or in the aggregate with all other such breaches and untrue
representations and warranties, give rise to the failure of a condition set

to the Closing Date by Purchaser or is not cured within forty-five (45) days
of notice of such breach;

(g) By Purchaser, if prior to the Closing Date there shall have been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Company
contained in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of Company
shall have become untrue after the date hereof, which breach or untrue
representation or warranty (i) would, individually or in the aggregate with

is incapable of being cured prior to the Closing Date by Company or is not
cured within forty-five (45) days of notice of such breach; and

liabilities or damages arising out of fraud or such partys willful and
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement (including Sections
3.1(f) and 5.14 as provided in Section 5.14).

 



61 Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

(i) Section 7.1(c) or 7.1(h);

(ii) Section 7.1(b) and (A) a vote of the stockholders of Company
contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting to obtain
the Required Company Vote has not occurred and (B) a proposal with respect to
an Alternative Transaction shall have been publicly proposed or announced or
otherwise submitted to the Board of Directors of Company by any Person and not
irrevocably withdrawn after the date hereof and prior to the date of
termination of this Agreement; or

 

(iii) Section 7.1(d), if a proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction
shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise publicly
disclosed and not irrevocably withdrawn prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting,

 

then, (x) in the case of a termination contemplated by Section 7.3(a)(i),
Company shall pay to Purchaser within one (1) Business Day following
termination of this Agreement the Termination Fee by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account specified by Purchaser and (y) in
the case of a termination contemplated by Section 7.3(a)(ii) or Section
7.3(a)(iii), if, in each case, Company, within twelve (12) months after such
termination either consummates an Alternative Transaction or enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Alternative Transaction,
Company shall pay to Purchaser the Termination Fee simultaneously with such
consummation or entering into such definitive agreement, as the case may be,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by
Purchaser. For purposes of the foregoing clause (y), each reference to "15
per cent" in the definition of Alternative Transaction shall be deemed to be a
reference to "50 per cent."

 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount in
cash equal to $146,000,000; provided, however, that if this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or (ii) by Company
because pursuant to Section 7.1(h), in each case, in connection with the
execution by Company of a binding agreement with an Excluded Party (as
defined below) providing for a Superior Proposal, then _"Termination Fee_ "
shall mean an amount in cash equal to $73,000,000. " _Excluded Party_ " means
a Person from whom Company received, during the period commencing on the date
hereof and ending at 11:59 p.m., New York time, on the thirtieth (30th) day
following the date hereof (the " _Excluded Period_ "), a bona fide written
proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction, which the Board of
Directors of Company determined in good faith, prior to the end of the
Excluded Period, was or was reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior
Proposal.

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear
its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



62 (d) Each of Purchaser and Company agrees that the provisions contained in
this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, that the damages resulting from the termination of this
Agreement as set forth in Section 7.3(a) of this Agreement are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable by Company
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) hereof are reasonable forecasts of the actual
damages which may be incurred by Purchaser under such circumstances. The
amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a) hereof constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) if Purchaser receives or is entitled to receive any amounts
payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a), such payment shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Purchaser and Merger Sub against Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and
other Representatives and none of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or other Representatives shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if
Purchaser or Merger Sub receives any payments from Company in respect of any
breach of this Agreement, and thereafter Purchaser is entitled to receive any
amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a), any such amounts payable pursuant
to Section 7.3(a) shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of any payments
made by Company to Purchaser or Merger Sub in respect of any such breaches of
this Agreement. If Company fails to pay to Purchaser any amounts due under
Section 7.3(a) in accordance with the terms hereof, Company shall pay the
costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of
Purchaser in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit
or other legal action, taken to collect payment that results in a judgment
against Company for such amounts due under Section 7.3(a).

 

(e) Any amounts not paid when due pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall bear
interest from the date such payment is due until the date paid at a rate
equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on
the date of such payment.

interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or

Agreement.

Section 8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf attachments, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each
party has received counterparts thereof signed and delivered (by electronic
communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the other parties, it being
understood that all the parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

Section 8.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement, including the schedules hereto, and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Each party
hereto agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, neither Purchaser and Merger Sub, nor Company
makes any other representations or warranties, and each hereby disclaims any
other representations or warranties, express or implied, or as to the accuracy
or completeness of any other information made by, or made available by,
itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to, or in connection with,

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is

through actions expressly approved by the Board of Directors of Company, and
no stockholder of Company whether purporting to act in its capacity as a
stockholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on
behalf of Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause the
exercise of any such right.

(c) The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the parties in accordance with Section 8.9 without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date hereof or as of any other date.

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to
