---|---|--- 
 



14 Assumed Liabilities. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 2.06 Purchase Price Adjustment.

 



     | (a) | Not later than seventy-five (75) days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Vendor a statement of the Closing
Working Capital, which statement shall be substantially in the form of
Section 2.06(a) of the Disclosure Schedules (the "Closing Working Capital
Statement"), and shall set out the Working Capital as at the end of the day on
the day prior to the Closing Date (such Working Capital, as finally determined
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.06, referred to as the "Closing
Working Capital"). The Vendor shall reasonably cooperate with the Purchaser
and its Representatives to the extent required to prepare the Closing
Working Capital Statement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | During the period from the date the Closing Working Capital
Statement is delivered by the Purchaser to the Vendor through the date such
statement is finally determined in accordance with the terms of this Section
2.06, the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Vendor to provide the Vendor with
reasonable access to the work papers of the Purchaser relating to the
preparation of the Closing Working Capital Statement, and the Purchaser shall
make reasonably available to the Vendor individuals responsible for the
preparation of the Closing Working Capital Statement in order to respond to
inquiries of the Vendor related thereto. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | If the Vendor notifies the Purchaser that the Vendor agrees
with the Closing Working Capital Statement within thirty (30) days after
receipt thereof or fails to deliver notice to the Purchaser of its
disagreement therewith within such thirty (30) day period, such Closing
Working Capital Statement shall be conclusive and binding on the Vendor and
the Purchaser and the parties shall be deemed to have agreed thereto, in the
first case, on the date the Purchaser receives the notice and, in the second
case, on such 30th day. If the Vendor disagrees with the Closing Working
Capital Statement or the calculation of the Closing Working Capital as set
forth therein, then the Vendor shall notify the Purchaser of its disagreement
(the "Dispute Notice") within such thirty (30) day period together with
reasonable particulars of the basis of such dispute, including the Vendors
position on the amounts in dispute (and the resulting Vendor position on the
amount of the Closing Working Capital). In such event, the Vendor and the
Purchaser shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve their differences with
respect thereto within thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Purchaser of
the Dispute Notice and make any amendments to the Closing Working Capital
Statement as mutually agreed to by the parties. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

Any dispute over the Closing Working Capital Statement or the calculation of
Closing Working Capital as set forth in the Dispute Notice not resolved by
the Purchaser and the Vendor within such thirty (30) day period after receipt
of the Dispute Notice (or such other period as the parties may agree) shall be
submitted to the Independent Auditor to determine such dispute, and such
determination 

---|---|--- 
 



15 Auditor shall allow the Purchaser and the Vendor to present their respective
positions regarding the dispute (provided that, for greater certainty, such
presentations are limited to matters described in the Dispute Notice) and each
of the Purchaser and the Vendor shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information, and make an oral presentation
to the Independent Auditor, regarding such dispute and the Independent
Auditor shall consider such additional documents, materials and other
information and such oral presentation. Any such other documents, materials or
other information shall be copied to each of the Purchaser and the Vendor and
each of the Vendor and the Purchaser shall be entitled to attend any such oral
presentation. The Independent Auditor shall determine, based solely on such
presentations from the Vendor and the Purchaser and not by independent
review, only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute
Notice and shall render a written report (the "Adjustment Report") to the
Vendor and the Purchaser in which the Independent Auditor shall, after
considering all matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, determine what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the Closing Working Capital Statement
and the Closing Working Capital. The Adjustment Report shall set forth,
in reasonable detail, the Independent Auditors determination with respect to
each of the disputed items or amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the
revisions, if any, to be made to the Closing Working Capital Statement and/or
the Closing Working Capital, together with supporting calculations, and the
parties shall make such revisions to the Closing Working Capital Statement, as
applicable. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Auditor: (i) shall
be bound to the principles of this Section 2.06 (including Section 2.06(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules), (ii) shall limit its review to matters specifically
set forth in the Dispute Notice, and (iii) shall not assign a value to any
item higher than the highest value for such item claimed by either party or
lower than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party. The parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to
complete its work and render its determination within thirty (30) days of its
engagement. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be
allocated to and borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Vendor, on
the other hand, based on the inverse of the percentage that the Independent
Auditors determination (before such allocation) bears to the total amount of
the total items in dispute as originally submitted to the Independent Auditor.
For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the
Independent Auditor awards $600 in favour of the Purchasers position, 60% of
the costs of the Independent Auditors review would be borne by the Vendor,
and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Purchaser.  
---|--- 



     | (e) | For greater certainty, each of the Closing Working Capital,
Closing Working Capital Statement and Target Working Capital are to be
calculated and prepared in a manner consistent, and in accordance with, the
indicative Working Capital calculation set forth in Section 2.06(a) of the
Disclosure Schedules. 
---|---|--- 
 



16 Section 2.07 Payment of Purchase Price Adjustments.

 



     | (a) | On the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which
the Closing Working Capital Statement has been finalized in accordance with
Section 2.06 (whether by agreement of the parties, deemed agreement or
by determination made by the Independent Auditor pursuant to Section
2.06(d)), the following payments shall be made: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | if the Closing Working Capital is equal to or greater than
the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid the amount of any surplus to the Vendor by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Vendor; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Closing Working Capital, the Vendor shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Purchaser the amount of such deficiency by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Purchaser, provided that the
Purchaser shall, at its option, have recourse to the Escrow Amount to satisfy
such deficiency. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Adjustments for Tax Purposes. Any payments made under this
Section 2.07 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the
parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.  
---|---|--- 

Section 2.08 Allocation of Purchase Price.

 

The Vendor and the Purchaser agree that the Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Purchased Assets for all purposes (including Tax and financial
accounting) in accordance with the principles and categories set forth in the
allocation schedule attached hereto as Section 2.08 of the Disclosure
Schedules (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Purchaser and the Vendor agree that
the values so attributed to the Purchased Assets are the respective fair
market values thereof, and the Purchaser and the Vendor shall file all Tax
returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and elections
required or desirable under the Tax Act in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Schedule. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 2.06
shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule.

 

Section 2.09 Third-party Consents.

 

To the extent that the Vendors rights under any Contract or Permit
constituting a Purchased Asset, or any other Purchased Asset, may not be
assigned to the Purchaser without the consent of another Person which has not
been obtained, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the
same if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be
unlawful, and the Vendor Parties, at their own expense, shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain any such required consent(s) as promptly as possible.
If any such consent shall not be obtained or if any attempted assignment would
be ineffective or would impair the Purchasers rights under such Purchased
Asset so that the Purchaser would not in effect acquire the benefit of all
such rights, the Vendor, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and the
Purchased Asset, shall act after the Closing as the Purchasers agent to
obtain for it the benefits thereunder and shall cooperate, to the maximum
extent permitted by Law and the Purchased Asset, with the Purchaser in any
other reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the
Purchaser.

any information by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements
of Law, the Vendor Party shall promptly notify the Purchaser in writing and
shall disclose only that portion of such information that the Vendor is

relationship with the Business, to terminate or modify any such actual or
prospective relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) a Vendor Party
may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment, securities of any
Person traded on any stock exchange if such Vendor Party is not a controlling
Person of, or a member of a group which controls, such Person and does not,
directly or indirectly, own 5% or more of any class of securities of such
Person; and (b) the Principal may continue to hold a direct or indirect

---|---|--- 



     | (d) | The Vendor Parties acknowledge that a breach or threatened
breach of this Section 6.04 would give rise to irreparable harm to the
Purchaser, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, and
hereby agrees that, in the event of a breach or a threatened breach by a
Vendor Party of any such obligations, the Purchaser shall, in addition to any
and all other rights and remedies that may be available to it in respect of
such breach, be entitled to equitable relief, including a temporary
restraining order, an interim or permanent injunction, specific performance
and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent equitable

contained in this Section 6.04 are reasonable and necessary to protect the

certainty only the Material Consents shall be required to be delivered by the
Vendor Parties on Closing. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to
preserve any right or benefit under any Contract to which the Vendor is a
party is not obtained before the Closing, the Vendor Parties shall, subsequent
to the Closing, cooperate with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain such
consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If
such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, the Vendor Parties
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser with
the rights and benefits of the affected Contract for the term thereof and, if
the Vendor Parties provide such rights and benefits, the Purchaser shall
assume all obligations and burdens thereunder.

is an Assigned Contract. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | Notwithstanding the terms of Section 2.03, the Ceridian Contract
shall not be assigned to the Purchaser on the Closing Date, but shall instead
be held by the Vendor in trust for the benefit of the Purchaser until such
time that the Purchaser has notified the Vendor that the Purchaser has been

about January 1, 2017). Immediately following such notice from the Purchaser,
and in any event, no later than February 1, 2017, the Vendor and the

Payroll Costs under the Ceridian Agreement to the extent that such amounts
accrue from and after the Closing Date.

45 Section 7.05 Indemnification Procedures.

 

The party making a claim under this Article VII is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party", and the party against whom such claims are
asserted under this Article VII is referred to as the "Indemnifying Party".



     | (a) |

Third-party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion
or commencement of any Action made or brought by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a
Representative of the foregoing (a "Third-party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall
give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in
any event not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of such
Third-party Claim. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defences
by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall: (i)
describe the Third-party Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) include copies of
all material written evidence thereof and (iii) indicate the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to
assume the defence of any Third-party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys
expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party
shall co-operate in good faith in such defence; provided that, if
the Indemnifying Party is a Vendor Party, such Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to defend or direct the defence of any such Third-party Claim
that: (x) is asserted directly by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier
or customer of the Business, or (y) seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defence of any Third-party Claim, subject to Section 7.05(b), it shall have
the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counter-claims pertaining to any such Third-party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right to participate in the defence of any Third-party Claim
with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to
control the defence thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, _provided that_ , if in
the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party: (A) there are
legal defences available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party in each
jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-party
Claim, fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its
election to defend as provided in this Agreement or fails to diligently
prosecute the defence of such Third-party Claim, the Indemnified Party may,
subject to Section 7.05(b), pay, compromise, defend such Third-party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third-party Claim. The Vendor Parties and the Purchaser
shall co-operate with each other in all reasonable respects in 

---|---|--- 
 



46 including making available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.02) records
relating to such Third-party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other
than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defence of such Third-party Claim. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | Settlement of Third-party Claims. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into
settlement of any Third-party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this Section 7.05(b). If a firm
offer is made to settle a Third-party Claim without leading to liability or
the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified
Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all Liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Third-party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to
such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect
to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such
firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the
Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-party Claim
and, in that event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such
Third-party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails
to assume defence of such Third-party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may
settle the Third-party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to
settle such Third-party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the
defence under Section 7.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which
does not result from a Third-party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted
by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt
written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30) days after
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The failure to give
such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party forfeits rights or defences by reason of such failure. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall: (i) describe the Direct Claim in reasonable
detail, (ii) include copies of all material written evidence thereof and (iii)
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that
has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in
writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Indemnified
Partys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such 30-day period, the

remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and
subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 7.06 Payments.

 

Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to
be payable under this Article VII, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its
obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, non-appealable
adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided that,
where the Vendor Parties are the Indemnifying Party, during the term of the
Escrow Agreement and until the Escrow Amount is exhausted, such obligations
will be satisfied by the Escrow Agent releasing the portion of the Escrow
Amount required to satisfy the Loss, in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. The parties hereto agree that, except for payments to be
made in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, should an Indemnifying Party not
make full payment of any such obligations within such fifteen (15) Business
Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest from and including the
date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, non-appealable
adjudication to and including the date such payment has been made at a rate
per annum equal to the Prime Rate. Such interest shall be calculated daily on
the basis of a 366 day year and the actual number of days elapsed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, any Losses
finally determined to be payable to the Purchaser under Section 7.02 shall be
satisfied by payment from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement until the Escrow Amount has been exhausted. Any Losses finally
determined to be payable to the Purchaser under Section 7.02 in excess of the
Escrow Amount shall be paid by the Vendor Parties, as Indemnifying Party, in
accordance with this Section 7.06. The Vendor Parties shall promptly take such
steps and execute such directions and documents to the Escrow Agent as may be
required in order to provide for the timely release of the Escrow Amount to
satisfy payments to the Purchaser as set out in this Section 7.06.

 

Section 7.07 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.

 

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law. For greater certainty, any such decrease or
increase of the Purchase Price will be allocated among the Purchased Assets to
which such payment by the Vendor or the Purchaser, respectively, can
reasonably be considered to relate or if such payment does not reasonably
relate to a particular Purchased Asset(s), such decrease or increase will be
allocated to the goodwill of the Business. If any payment made by the Vendor
Parties or the Purchaser pursuant to this Article VII is deemed by the
HST/GST Act to include HST/GST or is deemed by any applicable provincial or
territorial legislation to include a similar value added or multi-staged tax,
the amount of such payment shall be increased accordingly.

 

Section 7.08 Effect of Investigation.

 

The representations, warranties and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall
not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (including by any of its Representatives) or
by reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives
knew or should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or
might be inaccurate.

 



48 Section 7.09 Exclusive Remedies.

 

Subject to Section 6.04 and Section 8.11, the parties acknowledge and agree
that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims (other
than claims arising from fraud, criminal activity or wilful misconduct on the
part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be under the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article VII. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims
and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except under the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article VII. Nothing in this Section 7.09 shall limit any Persons right
to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any Person shall be entitled
or to seek any remedy on account of any partys fraudulent, criminal or wilful
misconduct.

 

Section 7.10 One Recovery.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Person shall be
entitled to any duplicative payment or recovery under this Agreement.

 

Section 7.11 Duty to Mitigate.

 

Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss
which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by the other party of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement,
provided that no party shall be required to incur any costs or to institute
any legal proceedings in making such efforts.
