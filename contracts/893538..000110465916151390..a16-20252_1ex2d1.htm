Business Days prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for
review a draft settlement statement (the " ** _Preliminary Settlement
Statement_** ") that shall set forth the Adjusted Cash Consideration,

Preliminary Settlement Statement delivered by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 3.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _3.6_** **_Final Settlement Statement._**

 



 

(a) On or before one hundred twenty (120) days after Closing, a final
settlement statement (the " ** _Final Settlement Statement_** ") will be
prepared by Seller, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim
Period and which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Cash
Consideration and shows the resulting final Cash Consideration (the " **
_Final Cash Price_** "). Seller shall, at Buyers request, supply reasonable
documentation in its or its Affiliates possession available to support the
actual revenue, expenses and other items for which adjustments are made. The
Final Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts
required by this Agreement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within
thirty (30) days, after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall
return to Seller a written report containing any proposed changes to the Final
Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons
therefor (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** "). Any changes not so specified in the
Dispute Notice shall be deemed waived, and Sellers determinations with
respect to all such elements of the Final Settlement Statement that are not
addressed specifically in the Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to
timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to
be made to the Final Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as
delivered by Seller will be deemed to be correct and mutually agreed upon by
the Parties, and will be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to
further audit or arbitration. If the Final Cash Price set forth in the Final
Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, the Final
Settlement Statement and the Final Cash Price, shall be final and binding on
the Parties. Any difference in the Adjusted Cash Consideration as paid at
Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Cash
Price shall be paid by the owing Party to the owed Party within ten (10) days
after final determination of such owed amounts in accordance herewith. All
amounts paid pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ shall be delivered in United
States currency by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified in writing by the relevant Party.

 



 

(b) Subject to matters for which a Party has an indemnity obligation pursuant
to _Article XIII_, the Final Settlement Statement shall be the final
accounting for any and all revenues, proceeds and/or Operating Expenses, and
there shall be no adjustment for, or obligation to pay, any revenues, proceeds
or Operating Expenses between the Parties after the Final Settlement Statement
has been agreed upon by the Parties or determined by the Accounting
Arbitrator.

 



 

 ** _3.7_** **_Disputes._** If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the
matters addressed in the Dispute Notice (if any), each of Buyer and Seller
shall: (i) within fifteen (15) Business Days after the delivery of such
Dispute Notice, select (by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller) an accounting
arbitrator to resolve the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice (the " **
_Accounting Arbitrator_** "), or absent such mutual agreement during such
period, then the Houston, Texas office of the American Arbitration Association
shall select the Accounting Arbitrator, and (ii) within twenty five (25)
Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its
position with regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty (20)
pages or less and submit such summaries to the Accounting Arbitrator together
with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other
documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within ten (10) Business Days
after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall render a decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position
with respect to each

 



      
 

 



 

matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials submitted to
the Accounting Arbitrator as described above. Any decision rendered by the
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding
on Seller and Buyer and will be enforceable against the Parties in any court
of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 



 

 ** _3.8_** **_Allocated Values._** Buyer and Seller agree that the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets as set forth in _Schedule
3.8_ to this Agreement (the " ** _Allocated Values_** "). Buyer and Seller
agree that such allocation is reasonable and shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith, including in notices to Preferential Purchase Right
holders except as required by Law; provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of such
allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before
any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging such allocation. Any adjustments to the Purchase Price shall be
allocated in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values, with such
allocation to be agreed by the parties, and any disputes related thereto
resolved, as provided in _Sections 3.6_ and _3.7 mutatis mutandis_.

 



 

 ** _3.9_** **_Allocation for Imbalances at Closing._** If, prior to Closing,
either Party discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in _Schedule 4.12_
, then the Cash Consideration shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to
_Section 3.3(a)(v)_, _Section 3.3(a)(vi)_, _Section 3.3(b)(vi)_ or _Section
3.3(b)(vii)_, as applicable, and _Schedule 4.12_ will be deemed amended
immediately prior to Closing to reflect the Imbalances for which the Cash
Consideration is so adjusted.

 



 

 ** _3.10_** **_Withholding Tax._** In the event Buyer reasonably determines
that it is required by applicable Law to deduct and withhold from the Purchase
Price any Tax, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amount;
_provided_ that Buyer shall notify Seller of its determination reasonably in
advance of the Closing, and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to
minimize to the extent permissible under applicable Law the amount of any such
deduction or withholding, including by providing any certificates or forms
that are reasonably requested to establish an exemption from (or reduction in)
any deduction or withholding. All such withheld amounts shall be treated as
delivered to Seller hereunder.

 



 

 ** _3.11_** **_Buyer Material Adverse Effect_**. If Closing does not occur
solely as a result of a failure of _Section 8.1_ to be satisfied as a result
of a breach of _Section 5.5(a)_ (a " ** _Section 5.5(a) Breach_**"), Buyer,
at its option, may elect to substitute $375,000,000 (the " ** _Additional Cash
Consideration_** ") in place of the Equity Consideration. In order to make
such an election, Buyer shall provide written notice to Seller no later than
the later of (a) December 21, 2016, or (b) one (1) Business Day after Seller
has notified Buyer that it does not intend to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement because of a Section 5.5(a) Breach. Following
such notice from Buyer, Seller may either approve such election or deny such
election and waive the closing condition in _Section 8.1_ with respect to the
Section 5.5(a) Breach. If Seller fails to respond within two (2) Business Days
following its receipt of such notice from Buyer, Seller will be deemed to have
denied approval and waived the closing condition in _Section 8.1_ with
respect to the Section 5.5(a) Breach. If Seller approves, references to
"Equity Consideration" in this Agreement shall be changed to "Additional Cash
Consideration" unless the context requires otherwise, and at Closing, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller, to the accounts designated in the

 



      
 

 



 

Preliminary Settlement Statement, by direct bank or wire transfer in same day
funds, the Additional Cash Consideration.

transactions contemplated hereby (including the issuance of Buyer Common Stock
to Seller as Equity Consideration) do not require any vote of the stockholders

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such contract or agreement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries in Buyers or such Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Buyer SEC Documents.

 ** _5.12_** **_Regulatory._** Buyer is and hereafter shall continue to be

 **ARTICLE X 
ACCESS/DISCLAIMERS**

 



 

 ** _10.1_** **_Access._**

 



 

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 10.1_, Seller shall afford to Buyer and its
authorized representatives (" ** _Buyer s Representatives_**") reasonable
access, to Sellers personnel knowledgeable with respect to the Assets, the
Assets and all Records in Sellers or any of its Affiliates possession at
such time to the extent necessary to conduct (i) the title or environmental
review described in this Agreement and (ii) reasonable due diligence with
respect to Asset Taxes. All investigations and due diligence conducted by
Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost,
risk and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer
or any Buyers Representative shall result from Buyers own independent review
and judgment.

 



 

(b) From the Execution Date to the Title Claim Date, Buyers inspection right
with respect to the Environmental Condition of the Assets shall be limited to
a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Assets conducted by a reputable
environmental consulting or engineering firm (the " ** _Environmental
Consultant_** ") and may include only visual inspections and record reviews
relating to the Assets. If, following the conduct of any such environmental
assessments, Buyer, in its reasonable determination based on the findings and
results of the environmental assessments conducted by the Environmental
Consultant, determines that further investigation, sampling or testing or
other site assessment commonly referred to as a "Phase II" site assessment
(collectively, " ** _Phase II Environmental Site Assessment_** ") is required
to confirm the existence or scope of an Environmental Defect or determine the
magnitude of the Remediation Amount, Buyer may request an authorization to
conduct such Phase II Assessment, subject to Sellers or any applicable third
party operators consent. If Buyer is not allowed access to conduct a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, or based upon the Environmental Consultants
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, a Phase II Environmental Site
Assessment, in each case, in accordance with this _Section 10.1(b)_ and with
respect to any Asset, then Buyer may elect, in its sole discretion, to exclude
the affected Assets and any related Assets from the transaction contemplated
hereby, in which event the affected Assets and any related Assets will be
deemed Excluded Assets, and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the
Allocated Value of all such affected Assets and any related Assets. In
conducting such Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, Buyer shall not operate
any equipment or conduct any testing or sampling of soil, groundwater or other
materials (including any testing or sampling for Hazardous Substances,
Hydrocarbons or NORM). Seller or Sellers designee shall have the right to be
present during any stage of the assessment. Buyer shall give Seller reasonable
prior written notice before entering onto any of the Assets, and Seller or its
designee shall have the right to accompany Buyer and Buyers Representatives
whenever they are on site on the Assets.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its access rights, environmental property
assessments and physical inspections of the Assets with Seller to minimize any
inconvenience to

 



      
 

 



 

or interruption of the conduct of business by Seller. Buyer shall abide by
Sellers safety rules, regulations and operating policies provided in advance
in writing to Buyer while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the
Assets, including any environmental or other inspection or assessment of the
Assets. Buyer hereby defends, indemnifies and holds harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Liabilities arising out of,
resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental property
assessment or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any Buyers
Representative with respect to the Assets, **EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE
OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR
THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY, ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY
LIABILITIES TO THE EXTENT ACTUALLY RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY. **Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Buyer be required to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any Liabilities
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any pre-existing Environmental
Conditions identified by or on behalf of Buyer as a result of any physical
inspection, due diligence activities or access granted to Buyer and Buyers
Representatives pursuant hereto, provided that Buyer does not exacerbate any
such pre-existing Environmental Condition.

 



 

(d) Buyer acknowledges that any entry into Sellers offices or onto the Assets
shall be at Buyers sole risk, cost and expense, and, subject to the terms
hereof, that none of the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be liable in any way
for any injury, loss or damage arising out of such entry that may occur to
Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer
hereby fully waives and releases any and all Liabilities against all of the
Seller Indemnified Parties for any injury, death, loss or damage to any of
Buyers Representatives or their property in connection with Buyers due
diligence activities, **EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM,
IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF, OR THE VIOLATION OF LAW BY,
ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY LIABILITIES ACTUALLY RESULTING
FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED
PARTY**.

 



 

(e) Buyer agrees to provide to Seller promptly, but in no event later than the
Environmental Claim Date, copies of all final reports and test results
prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyers Representatives which relate to any
Environmental Defect that Buyer intends to assert. Seller shall not be deemed
by its receipt of said documents or otherwise to have made any representation
or warranty, express, implied or statutory, as to the condition of the Assets
or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein.
Buyer (in the event Closing does not occur) and Seller (in the event Closing
occurs) shall keep and maintain confidential (and not disclose to any other
Person, except as required by any Governmental Authority, in whole or in part)
any results of (or reports or other documents arising from) an environmental
assessment of the Assets, unless disclosure of such information is required by
applicable Law or necessary to prevent an imminent and substantial
endangerment.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates (i) repair
all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyers and/or any of Buyers
Representatives due diligence, (ii) restore the Assets to the approximate
same condition as they were prior to commencement of any such due diligence
and (iii) remove all equipment, tools and other property brought onto the
Assets in connection with such due diligence, provided that in no event will
the foregoing be interpreted to require Buyer to remediate any Environmental
Defect to the extent not caused by Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives.

 



 

(g) During all periods that Buyer and/or any of Buyers Representatives are on
the Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, policies of insurance of the types and in
the amounts reasonably requested by Seller. Coverage under all insurance
required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary insurance, (ii)
list the Seller Indemnified Parties as additional insureds, (iii) waive
subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties and (iv) provide for ten
(10) days prior written notice to Seller in the event of cancellation,
expiration or modification of the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon
request by Seller, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to Seller
prior to entering the Assets.

 



 

 ** _10.2_** **_Confidentiality._** Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant to its
right of access to the Records or the Assets, Buyer and/or Buyers
Representatives will become privy to confidential and other information of
Seller or its Affiliates, and Buyer shall ensure that such confidential
information (a) shall not be used for any purpose other than in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) shall be held confidential
by Buyer and Buyers Representatives, in each case, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreements. If Closing should
occur, the each Confidentiality Agreement and the foregoing confidentiality
restrictions on Buyer shall terminate (except as to (i) such portion of the
Assets that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement, (ii) the Excluded Assets and (iii) information related to Seller or
its Affiliates or to assets other than the Assets).

_(subject to the depth restrictions set forth on _Exhibit A-1 _or _Exhibit
A-2, _as applicable, and limited to any currently producing formations), and
(ii) through a special warranty on the Leases, the Drilling Units set forth on
_Schedule 3.8_ (subject to the depth restrictions set forth on _Exhibit A-1
_or _Exhibit A-2, _as applicable), unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever
lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by, through or
under Seller or its Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however, to the
Permitted Encumbrances and to any matters of real property record in the
applicable counties or in the applicable state or federal records prior to the
Title Claim Date.

 



 

(c) _Recovery on Special Warranty_.

 



 

(i) _Buyer s Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches_. Prior to the expiration
of the period of time commencing as of the Closing Date and ending at 5 p.m.
Central Time on the four (4) year anniversary thereof (the " ** _Survival
Period_** "), Buyer shall furnish Seller a Title Defect Notice meeting the
requirements of _Section 11.2(a)_ setting forth any matters which Buyer
intends to assert as a breach of Sellers special warranty of title set forth
in the Assignment. For all purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed
to have waived, and Seller shall have no further liability for, any breach of
Sellers special warranty that Buyer fails to assert by a Title Defect Notice
given to Seller on or before the expiration of the Survival Period. Seller
shall have a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure any Title

 



      
 

 



 

Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 11.1(c)(i)_. Buyer agrees
to reasonably cooperate with any attempt by Seller to cure any such Title
Defect.

 



 

(ii) _Limitations on Special Warranty_. For purposes of Sellers special
warranty of title set forth in the Assignment, the value of the Drilling Units
and/or Wells set forth in _Schedule 3.8_ , as appropriate ((1) for a Well,
subject to the depth restrictions set forth on _Exhibit A-1 _or _Exhibit
A-2, _as applicable, and limited to any currently producing formations, and
(2) for a Drilling Unit, subject to the depth restrictions set forth on
_Exhibit A-1 _or _Exhibit A-2, _as applicable), shall be deemed to be the
Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted herein. Recovery on Sellers special
warranty of title shall be limited to an amount (without any interest accruing
thereon) equal to the reduction in the Cash Consideration to which Buyer would
have been entitled had Buyer asserted the defect giving rise to such breach of
Sellers special warranty of title as a Title Defect prior to the Title Claim
Date pursuant to _Section 11.2_, except that the Individual Title Defect
Threshold and the Aggregate Deductible shall not apply. Seller shall be
entitled to offset any amount owed by Seller for breach of its special
warranty of title with respect to any Asset by the amount of any Title
Benefits with respect to such Asset; _provided_ that Seller gives Buyer notice
before the later of (x) 30 days after Sellers receipt of a Title Defect
Notice for such special warranty breach and (y) the final resolution of any
dispute relating to such special warranty breach.

 



 

 ** _11.2_** **_Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments._**

 



 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. Buyer has the right but not the obligation to
deliver, no later than December 2, 2016 (the " ** _Title Claim Date_** "),
claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section 11.2(a)_
(collectively, the " ** _Title Defect Notices_** " and, individually, a " **
_Title Defect Notice_** ") setting forth any matters which, in Buyers
reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends to assert
as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Section 11.2(a)_. For all purposes of
this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except for
the special warranty of title set forth in the Assignment, Buyer shall be
deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title
Defect which Buyer fails to assert as a Title Defect by a properly delivered
Title Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Title Claim Date. To
be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall include
(i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Well or Drilling Unit
(including a reasonably detailed description to identify such Well or
applicable Lease affecting such Drilling Unit), or portion thereof, affected
by such Title Defect (each a " ** _Title Defect Property_** "), (ii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Title
Defect, and (iv) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect
and the computations upon which Buyers belief is based. Buyer may deliver any
documents required in connection with any Title Defect Notice to Seller via
DropBox or Microsoft OneDrive, or any other online storage application
approved by Seller. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and
curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller,
on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Title Claim Date,
written notice of all alleged Title Defects discovered by Buyer during the
preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature and
supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date, provided that any failure of Buyer
to deliver such notice shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Buyer
shall also, promptly upon discovery, furnish Seller with written notice of

 



      
 

 



 

any Title Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyers or any of its
Affiliates employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while
conducting Buyers due diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the Title
Claim Date. Buyer acknowledges that the Drilling Units are proposed drilling
and spacing units and have yet been, and are subject to being, formed.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Title Claim Date with respect
to each Title Benefit a notice (a " ** _Title Benefit Notice_** ") including
(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Asset, or portion
thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a " ** _Title Benefit
Property_** "), and (ii) the amount by which Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by such alleged
Title Benefit and the computations upon which Sellers belief is based. Except
as set forth in _Section 11.1(c)(ii) _or _Section 11.2(a)_, Seller shall be
deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for which a Title Benefit Notice has
not been delivered on or before the Title Claim Date.

 



 

(c) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to one
hundred ten (110) days after Closing (the " ** _Cure Period_** "), any Title
Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer. During the period of time from
Closing to the expiration of the Cure Period, Buyer agrees to afford Seller
and its officers, employees and other authorized representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the Assets and all Records in Buyers
or any of its Affiliates possession in order to facilitate Sellers attempt
to cure any such Title Defects. No reduction shall be made to the Cash
Consideration with respect to any Title Defect for which Seller has provided
notice to Buyer prior to or on the Closing Date that Seller intends to attempt
to cure the Title Defect during the Cure Period. An election by Seller to
attempt to cure a Title Defect shall be without prejudice to its rights under
_Section 11.2(j)_ and shall not constitute an admission against interest or a
waiver of Sellers right to dispute the existence, nature or value of, or cost
to cure, the alleged Title Defect.

 



 

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 11.2(a)_ is not waived in
writing by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Seller shall, at its sole
option, elect to:

 



 

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or Final
Cash Price pursuant to _Section 3.6_, as applicable, by the Title Defect
Amount determined pursuant to _Section 11.2(g)_ or _Section _ _11.2(j)_ ;

 



 

(ii) with Buyers approval, indemnify Buyer against all Liability (up to the
Allocated Value of the applicable Title Defect Property) resulting from such
Title Defect with respect to such Title Defect Property pursuant to an
indemnity agreement in a form and substance mutually agreed upon by the
Parties (a " ** _Title Indemnity Agreement_** ");

 



 

(iii) if the asserted Title Defect Amount of any Title Defect Property is
greater than or equal to seventy five percent (75%) of the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect

 



      
 

 



 

Property, retain the entirety of such Title Defect Property, together with all
associated Assets, in which event the Cash Consideration or Final Cash Price,
as applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property and such associated Assets; or

 



 

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. Subject to Buyers continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Benefit and/or the Title Benefit Amount
asserted with respect thereto, with respect to the Title Benefit Properties
reported under _Section 11.2(b)_, the Title Defect Amounts attributable to
all properly raised and uncured Title Defects, in the aggregate, shall be
decreased by the aggregate amount of all increases to the Allocated Value for
such Title Benefit Properties reported under _Section 11.2(b)_ (each such
increase, a " ** _Title Benefit Amount_** ") attributable to all properly
raised Title Benefits.

 



 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers rights under Sellers special
warranty of title set forth in the Assignment and Buyers rights to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, the provisions set forth in
_Section 11.2(d)_ shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with
respect to Sellers failure to have Defensible Title with respect to any Asset
or any other title matter.

 



 

(g) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the " ** _Title Defect Amount_** " and shall be determined in
accordance with the following terms and conditions (without duplication):

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property on _Schedule 3.8_ , and the
Working Interest is reduced proportionately, then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
decrease and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Title Defect Property on _Schedule 3.8_ ;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy where (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Title Defect Property is less than (B) the Net Acres for such
Title Defect Property stated on _Schedule 3.8_ , then the Title Defect Amount
shall be the product obtained by multiplying such positive difference by the
Allocated Value (on a per Net Acre dollar amount) for such Title Defect
Property set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ ;

 



 

(v) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title

 



      
 

 



 

Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property
affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the
potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation;

 



 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XI_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

 



 

(h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions (without duplication):

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Sellers Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property on _Schedule 3.8_ , and the
Working Interest is increased proportionately then the Title Benefit Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Title Benefit Property on _Schedule 3.8_ ;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy where (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Title Benefit Property is greater than (B) the Net Acres for
such Title Benefit Property stated on _Schedule 3.8_ , then the Title Benefit
Amount shall be the product obtained by multiplying such difference by the
Allocated Value (on a per Net Acre dollar amount) for such Title Benefit
Property set forth on _Schedule 3.8_ ; and

 



 

(iv) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected
by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



 

(i) _Title Defect Threshold and Deductible_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Title
Defect for which the Title Defect Amount does not exceed $75,000 (the " **
_Individual Title Defect Threshold_** "); and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for
any Title Defect for which the Title Defect Amount exceeds the Individual
Title Defect Threshold unless

 



      
 

 



 

(A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all
such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but
excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to Title Defects cured by
Seller), _plus_ (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all Environmental
Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any
Environmental Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible,
after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Cash
Consideration or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only to
the extent that the amount by which the aggregate amount of such Title Defect
Amounts and Remediation Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Seller retains any Title Defect Property pursuant to
_Section 11.2(d)(iii)_, the Title Defect Amount related to such Title Defect
Property will not be counted towards the Aggregate Deductible and will not be
considered for purposes of _Section 7.4_ and/or _Section 8.4_.

 



 

(j) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
matters regarding (i) all Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts, and (ii) the adequacy of any curative materials
provided by Seller to cure an alleged Title Defect (the " ** _Disputed Title
Matters_** ") prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by
Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if Seller elects to attempt to cure
a Title Defect after Closing), the Disputed Title Matters shall be exclusively
and finally resolved pursuant to this _Section 11.2(j)_. There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be an attorney with at least fifteen (15) years
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement
of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the Closing or the end of
the Cure Period, as applicable, or, absent such agreement, by the Houston,
Texas office of the American Arbitration Association (the " ** _Title
Arbitrator_** "). Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Title
Arbitrator its proposed resolution of the Disputed Title Matter. The proposed
resolution of the Disputed Title Matter shall include the best offer of the
submitting Party in a single monetary amount that such Party is willing to pay
or accept (as applicable) to settle the Disputed Title Matter. The Title
Arbitrator shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the two
proposed settlement amounts. The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this _Section 11.2(j)_. The Title
Arbitrators determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the Disputed Title Matters and shall be final and binding upon
both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his determination with
respect to any Disputed Title Matter, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by
the rules set forth in _Section 11.2(g)_ and _Section _ _11.2(h)_ and,
subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters as, in the opinion
of the Title Arbitrator, are necessary to make a proper determination. The
Title Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount
than the Title Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect
Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific Disputed Title Matter submitted by either Party and
may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to
any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case to the Title Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator. To the
extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title Defect
Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to
the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or _Section 3.6(a)_, then,
within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Buyer and Seller of

 



      
 

 



 

his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title Benefit Amount,
and, subject to _Section 11.2(i)_, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount,
if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Seller, and (ii) Seller shall
pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer.
Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section 11.2(j)_ and, to the extent
any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Cash
Consideration shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent
adjustments to the Cash Consideration, if any, will be made pursuant to
_Section 3.6_ or this _Section 11.2_.

 



 

 ** _11.3_** **_Casualty and Condemnation Loss._**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets, and Buyer shall not assert such matters
as Casualty Losses or Title Defects hereunder.

 



 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain (each, a " ** _Casualty Loss_**
"), and the Closing thereafter occurs, (a) in the event of a taking, the
Assets affected thereby shall be excluded from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated
Value of all Assets affected by such taking, or (b) except as provided in (a),
Seller shall elect by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing either (i) to
cause, at Sellers sole cost and expense ( _less_ the amount of the applicable
deductible(s) under Sellers applicable insurance policies, which deductible
amounts shall be the responsibility of Buyer), any Asset affected by a
Casualty Loss to be repaired or restored to at least its quality and condition
as before the Casualty Loss as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work
may extend after the Closing Date), or (ii) reduce the Purchase Price by the
result of (A) the cost to repair or restore each Asset affected by such
Casualty Loss to at least its quality and condition as before the Casualty
Loss _less_ (B) the amount of the applicable deductible(s) under Sellers
applicable insurance policies, which deductible amounts shall be the
responsibility of Buyer. In each case, Seller shall be entitled to receive all
of its rights to insurance and other Claims (including any condemnation
proceeds) with respect to the Casualty Loss, except to the extent the Parties
otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

 ** _11.4_** **_Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign._**

 



 

(a) Pursuant to that certain Area of Mutual Interest Agreement (the " ** _AMI
Agreement_** "), dated August 22, 2016, between Seller and RRP-QStar, LLC ("
** _RRP_** "), (i) RRP has the right to sell its right, title and interest in
and to the Subject Assets (such right, title and interest of RRP, the " **
_RRP Assets_** ") to Buyer on the terms set forth in the AMI Agreement (" **
_RRP Tag Right_** "), and (ii) Seller has the right to require RRP to sell the
RRP Assets to Buyer on the terms set forth in the AMI Agreement (" ** _Drag
Right_** "). Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer,
Seller and RRP have entered into a letter agreement whereby: RRP has agreed to
sell, and Buyer has agreed to purchase and pay for, all of RRPs right, title
and interest in and to the RRP Assets on terms substantially similar to the
terms of this Agreement (with the

 



      
 

 



 

purchase price for such RRP Assets being set forth in _Schedule 11.4(a)_ ), in
satisfaction of RRPs exercise of the Tag Right (the " ** _RRP Purchase
Agreement_** ").

 



 

(b) Pursuant to that certain Joint Development Agreement (the " ** _JDA_** "),
dated July 1, 2015, between Seller and Double Eagle Development LLC (" **
_Double Eagle_** "), Double Eagle has the right to sell its right, title and
interest in and to the Subject Assets (such right, title and interest of
Double Eagle, the " ** _Double Eagle Assets_** ") to Buyer on the terms set
forth in the JDA (" ** _Double Eagle Tag Right_** "). If Double Eagle
exercises its Tag Right in accordance with the terms set forth in the JDA,
then Buyer shall enter into an agreement with Double Eagle for the purchase of
the Double Eagle Assets on terms substantially similar to the terms of this
Agreement (with the purchase price for such Double Eagle Assets being set
forth in _Schedule 11.4(b)_) (the " ** _Double Eagle Purchase Agreement_**
").

 



 

(c) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in _Schedule
4.10_ , Seller, promptly following the Execution Date, shall send to the
holder of each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice requesting such
holders exercise or waiver in material compliance with the contractual
provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

 



 

(i) If, (a) prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right
notifies Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to
which its Preferential Purchase Right applies, or (b) as of Closing, the time
for exercising a Preferential Purchase Right has not expired and such
Preferential Purchase Right has not been exercised or waived, then the Asset
subject to such Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets
to be assigned to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of
such Asset affected by the Preferential Purchase Right), and the Cash
Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion
thereof) so excluded. Seller shall be entitled to all proceeds paid by any
Person exercising a Preferential Purchase Right prior to Closing. If (1) such
holder of such Preferential Purchase Right thereafter fails to consummate the
purchase of the Asset (or portion thereof) covered by such Preferential
Purchase Right on or before the later of (x) sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date or (y) the time period specified in the contractual provisions
applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right, or (2) the time for exercising
such Preferential Purchase Right expires without exercise by the holder
thereof, then (A) Seller shall so notify Buyer, (B) Buyer shall purchase, on
or before ten (10) days following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or
portion thereof) that was so excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer
at Closing, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal to the
amount by which the Cash Consideration was reduced at Closing with respect to
such excluded Asset (or portion thereof) and (C) Seller shall assign to Buyer
the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an
instrument in substantially the same form as the Assignment.

 



 

(ii) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential
Purchase Right has expired without exercise by the holder thereof, in each
case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to Buyer at Closing pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) With respect to each Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_ , Seller,
promptly following the Execution Date, shall send to the holder of each such
Consent a notice in material

 



      
 

 



 

compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to such Consent seeking
such holders consent to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(i) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_ prior
to Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would cause (1) the
assignment of the Assets affected thereby to Buyer to be void or (2) the
termination of a Lease or Contract under the express terms thereof or (B) a
Consent requested by Seller is denied in writing, then, in each case, the
Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Consent shall be
excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing, and the Cash
Consideration shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that a Consent (with respect to an
Asset excluded pursuant to this _Section 11.4(d)(i)_) that was not obtained
prior to Closing is obtained within one hundred eighty (180) days following
Closing, then, within ten (10) days after such Consent is obtained (x) Buyer
shall purchase the Asset (or portion thereof) that was so excluded as a result
of such previously un-obtained Consent and pay to Seller the amount by which
the Cash Consideration was reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset
(or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment.

 



 

(ii) If (A) Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in _Schedule 4.4_ prior
to Closing and the failure to obtain such Consent would not cause (1) the
assignment of the Asset (or portion thereof) affected thereby to Buyer to be
void or (2) the termination of a Lease or Contract under the express terms
thereof and (B) such Consent requested by Seller is not denied in writing by
the holder thereof, then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such un-
obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller to Buyer at Closing
as part of the Assets and Buyer shall have no claim against, and Seller shall
have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such Consent.

 



 

(iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on _Schedule 4.4_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Party shall be required to incur any
Liability or pay any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Subject to the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Seller with any information or
documentation that may be reasonably requested by Seller and/or the Third
Party holder(s) of such Consents in order to facilitate the process of
obtaining such Consents.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

 ** _12.1_** **_Notice of Environmental Defects._**

 



 

(a) _Environmental Defects Notice_. Buyer has the right but not the obligation
to deliver no later than December 2, 2016 (the " ** _Environmental Claim
Date_** ") claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this _Section
12.1(a) _(collectively, the " ** _Environmental Defect Notices_** " and,
individually, an " ** _Environmental Defect Notice_** ") setting forth any
matters which, in Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects
and which Buyer asserts as Environmental Defects pursuant to this _Section
12.1_. To be effective, each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing
and shall include (i) a description of the matter constituting the alleged
Environmental Condition (including the applicable Environmental Law violated
or

 



       
 

 



 

implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by such alleged Environmental
Condition, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets (or portions thereof)
affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of such alleged
Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the Remediation Amount
(itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is attributable to such
alleged Environmental Defect. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, any Environmental
Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 12.1(a)_ shall be limited
to the Assets only, and Buyer shall not have the right to assert environmental
defects with respect to any other assets, properties or operations. For all
purposes of this Agreement, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller
shall have no liability for, (A) any Environmental Defect (other than the
Scheduled Environmental Matters) which Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice
received by Seller on or before the Environmental Claim Date, and/or (B) any
Environmental Defect affecting any assets, properties or operations other than
the Assets (other than contribution requirements in accordance with the
applicable operating agreements), in each case, with such liabilities being "
** _Buyer s Environmental Liabilities_**." Buyers calculation of the
Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe
in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental
Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify
all assumptions used by Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount, including
the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with Environmental
Laws. To give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing
Environmental Defects, Buyer agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller,
on or before the end of each calendar week prior to the Environmental Claim
Date, written notice of all alleged Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer
during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be preliminary in nature
and supplemented prior to the Environmental Claim Date, provided that any
failure of Buyer to deliver such notice shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before the Closing
Date. No reduction shall be made to the Purchase Price with respect to any
asserted Environmental Defect for which Seller has cured prior to Closing. An
election by Seller to attempt to cure an Environmental Defect shall be without
prejudice to its rights under _Section 12.1(f)_ and shall not constitute an
admission against interest or a waiver of Sellers right to dispute the
existence, nature or value of, or cost to cure, the alleged Environmental
Defect.

 



 

(c) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing right
to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation
Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_, in the event that any Environmental Defect
timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 12.1(a)_ is not waived
in writing by Buyer or cured prior to Closing, Seller shall, at its sole
option, elect to:

 



 

(i) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Cash Consideration by the Remediation Amount;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental
Defect, in which event the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset;

 



 

(iii) with Buyers approval, indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting
from such Environmental Defect with respect to the Assets pursuant to an
indemnity agreement in a form and substance mutually agreeable to the Parties
(each, an " ** _Environmental Indemnity Agreement_** "); or

 



 

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1(c)_.

 



 

If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above, Buyer shall be
deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses
attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to
such Environmental Defect and for all Liabilities with respect thereto and
such responsibility of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed
Obligations hereunder.

 



 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 14.1(c) _and as provided in this Agreement for breaches
of _Section 4.17_, the provisions set forth in _Section 12.1(b)_ shall be
the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental
Defect with respect to any Asset or other environmental matter.

 



 

(e) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, (i) in no event shall there be any adjustment to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect
for which the Remediation Amount does not exceed $150,000 (the " **
_Individual Environmental Threshold_** "); and (ii) in no event shall there be
any adjustment to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for
any Environmental Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the
Individual Environmental Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the
aggregate Remediation Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed
the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Remediation Amounts
attributable to any Environmental Defects cured by Seller), _plus_ (2) the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defect Amounts attributable to
Title Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after
which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Cash Consideration
or other applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with respect to the
amount by which the aggregate amount of such Remediation Amounts and Title
Defect Amounts exceeds the Aggregate Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt,
if Seller retains any Assets pursuant to _Section 12.1(c)(ii)_, the
Remediation Amounts relating to such retained Assets will not be counted
towards the Aggregate Deductible and will not be considered for purposes of
_Section 7.4_ and/or _Section 8.4_.

 



 

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on (i) all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to
Closing and (ii) the adequacy of any cure by Seller of any asserted
Environmental Defect prior to the end of the Cure Period (items (i) and (ii),
collectively, the " ** _Disputed Environmental Matters_** "). If Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree by Closing (or by the end of the Cure Period if
Seller elects to attempt to cure an asserted Environmental Defect after
Closing), the Disputed Environmental Matters

 



      
 

 



 

shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration pursuant to this
_Section 12.1(f)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be an
attorney with at least fifteen (15) years experience in environmental matters
involving oil and gas producing properties in the regional area in which the
affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and
Seller within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date or the end of the Cure
Period, as applicable, or, absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office
of the American Arbitration Association (the " ** _Environmental Arbitrator_**
"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this _Section 12.1_. The Environmental Arbitrators determination
shall be made within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in
dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of
appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this _Section 12.1_ and, subject to the
foregoing, may consider such other matters as in the opinion of the
Environmental Arbitrator are necessary or helpful to make a proper
determination. The Environmental Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer any
greater Remediation Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its
applicable Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act
as an expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed
Environmental Matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case to the Environmental Arbitrator. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-
half of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent
that the award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation
Amount is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or _Section 3.6(a)_, then, within ten (10) days
after the Environmental Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller
of his award with respect to any Remediation Amount, and, subject to _Section
12.1(e)_, (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the
Environmental Arbitrator to Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing
herein shall operate to cause Closing to be delayed on account of any
arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section 12.1(f)_, and, to the extent
any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of Closing, the Cash
Consideration shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing and subsequent
adjustments to the Cash Consideration, if any, will be made pursuant to
_Section 3.6_ or this _Section 12.1(f)_.

 



 

 ** _12.2_** **_NORM, Asbestos, Wastes and Other Substances._** Buyer
acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development, and
production of oil and gas and that there may be petroleum, produced water,
wastes or other substances or materials located in, on or under the Assets or
associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites included in the Assets may
contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach
itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale, or in other
forms. The wells, materials and equipment located on the Assets or included in
the Assets may contain NORM, asbestos and other wastes or Hazardous
Substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes or Hazardous
Substances may have come in contact with various environmental media,
including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required for
the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances
from the Assets. The presence of NORM or asbestos-containing

 



      
 

 



 

materials that are non-friable cannot be claimed as an Environmental Defect,
except to the extent constituting a violation of Environmental Laws.

Buyers right to indemnity pursuant to _Section 13.2, _Buyer and its

under _Section 6.3, Section 10.1, Section 13.2_ and _Section _ _13.3_ shall
be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of _Section 6.3, Section 10.1_ and this _Article XIII_, the
term " ** _Indemnifying Party_** " when used in connection with particular
Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify
the other Party and/or other Persons with respect to such Liabilities pursuant
to _Section 6.3, Section 10.1_ or this _Article XIII_, and the term " **
_Indemnified Party_** " when used in connection with particular Liabilities
shall mean the Party and/or other Persons having the right to be indemnified
with respect to such Liabilities by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
_Section 6.3, Section 10.1_ or this _Article XIII_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 6.3, Section 10.1_,
_Section 13.2_ or _Section _ _13.3_ , an Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party of its claim under this _Section 13.8_, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
" ** _Claim Notice_** "). In the event that the claim for indemnification is
based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party (a " **
_Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice
promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified Party to
give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this _Section 13.8(b)_
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section
6.3, Section 10.1_, _Section 13.2_ or _Section _ _13.3_ (as applicable)
except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available
to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party
Claim or otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day
period, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its obligation to defend and indemnify
the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and
obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate
in, but not control, at its own expense, any defense or settlement of any
Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Section 13.8(d)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third Party Claim or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all Liability in
respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any Third Party Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that
may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a
result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation to defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party
Claim, but fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle the
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right
of

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its obligation to
defend and indemnify the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten
(10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the liability
and consent to such settlement, (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in
its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any
failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond to such notice shall be deemed to
be an election under subsection (iii) above.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes
the claim for such Liabilities, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
dispute the claim for such Liabilities.

(a) Except for the Specified Representations and as otherwise provided in this
_Section 13.9(a)_, the representations and warranties of the Parties in

Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

 



 

(b) The indemnities in _Section 13.2(a)_, _Section 13.2(b)_, _Section _
_13.3(a)_ and _ Section _ _13.3(b)_ shall terminate as of the expiration
date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a
specific written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying
Party on or before such expiration date. Sellers indemnities in _Sections
13.2(c)_ , _13.2(d),_ and _ 13.2(f) _shall terminate twelve (12) months after

covenants running with the Assets ( _provided_ that Buyer and its successors
and assigns shall not be released from any of, and shall remain jointly and
severally liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for, the obligations and
Liabilities of Buyer under such Sections of this Agreement upon any transfer
or assignment of any Asset).

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _13.10_** **_Waiver of Right to Rescission._** Seller and Buyer
acknowledge that, following Closing, the payment of money or the disbursement
of portion(s) of the Holdback Amount, as applicable and in each case, as
limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
or for any other claim arising in connection with or with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As the payment of money or the
disbursement of portion(s) of the Holdback Amount, as applicable and in each
case, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate
compensation, following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 ** _13.11_** **_Insurance._** The amount of any Liabilities for which any of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement or in connection with or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be reduced by any corresponding insurance
proceeds received under the relevant insurance policies carried by such Buyer
Indemnified Party.

 



 

 ** _13.12_** **_Non-Compensatory Damages._** None of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties nor the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from
Seller or Buyer, as applicable, or their respective Affiliates, any special,
indirect, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages
(including damages for lost profits of any kind) arising under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except
to the extent any such Party suffers such damages to a Third Party, which
damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in
connection with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this

 **ARTICLE XIV 
TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES**

 



 

 ** _14.1_** **_Right of Termination._** This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

 



 

(a) by Seller, at Sellers option, if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ have not been satisfied on or before the Outside Termination
Date;

 



       
 

 



 

(b) by Buyer, at Buyers option, if any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ have not been satisfied on or before the Outside Termination
Date;

 



 

(c) by Buyer if the condition set forth in _Section 7.4_ has not been
satisfied on or before the Outside Termination Date or by Seller if the
condition set forth in _Section 8.4_ is not satisfied on or before the
Outside Termination Date; or

 



 

(d) by Seller or Buyer if Closing shall not have occurred on or before January
20, 2017 (the " ** _Outside Termination Date_** ");

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (a), (b) or (d) above if such Party or its
Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

 ** _14.2_** **_Effect of Termination._**

 



 

(a) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of _Section 14.1_ hereof, then,
except as provided in _Section 3.2_ and except for the provisions of
_Sections 10.1(c)_ through _10.1(g)_ , _10.2_ , _10.3_ , _13.12_ , this
_Section 14.2_, _Section 14.3_, _Article I_ and _Article XVI_ (other than
_Sections 16.2(b)_ through _16.2(h)_ , _16.7_ , _16.8, 16.15_ and _16.17_ )
and such of the defined terms set forth in _Section 15.1_ to give context to
such Sections, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and the Parties
shall have no liability or obligation hereunder except and to the extent such
termination results from the material breach by a Party of any of its
covenants or agreements hereunder in which case the other Party shall have the
right to seek all remedies available at law or in equity, including specific
performance, for such material breach and shall be entitled to recover court
costs and attorneys fees in addition to any other relief to which such Party
may be entitled; _provided_ that if Seller is entitled to and elects to retain
the Deposit as liquidated damages pursuant to _Section 14.2(b)_, then such
retention shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all
damages Seller may have against Buyer. The provision for payment of liquidated
damages in this _Section 14.2(a)_ has been included because, in the event of
a termination of this Agreement permitting Seller to retain the Deposit, the
actual damages to be incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to
approximate the amount of liquidated damages called for herein and because the
actual amount of such damages would be difficult if not impossible to measure
accurately.

 



 

(b) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at Closing or
contingent upon the satisfaction of other conditions precedent set forth in
_Article VII_ at Closing) have been met, or waived by Buyer, and (ii) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated because of:
(A) the failure of Buyer to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations hereunder, or (B) the failure of any of Buyers representations or
warranties hereunder to be true and correct in all respects (without regard to
materiality qualifiers) as of the Execution Date and/or as of the Closing,
except for those breaches, if any, of such representations and warranties that
in the aggregate would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, then, in such
event, Seller shall have the right to, at its option, (1) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 14.1_ and retain the Deposit together with any
interest or income thereon, free of any claims by Buyer with

 



      
 

 



 

respect thereto as liquidated damages or (2) seek all remedies available at
law or in equity, including specific performance by Buyer.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the mutual written agreement of the
Parties, or this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to _Section 14.1_
and the Closing does not occur on or before the Closing Date for any reason
other than as set forth in _Section 14.2(b)_, then Buyer shall be entitled to
the delivery of the Deposit together with any interest or income actually
earned thereon, free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto after the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _14.3_** **_Return of Documentation and Confidentiality._** Upon
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return to Seller all title,
engineering, geological and geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or
reports, maps and other information furnished by or on behalf of Seller to
Buyer or prepared by or on behalf of Buyer in connection with its due
diligence investigation of the Assets, in each case in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreements, and an officer of Buyer shall certify same to
Seller in writing.

 **ARTICLE XVI 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 ** _16.1_** **_Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules._** All of the Appendices,
Exhibits and Schedules referred to in this Agreement are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement by reference and constitute a part of this Agreement. Each
Party to this Agreement and its counsel has received a complete set of
Appendices, Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer or Seller in negotiating this Agreement or in
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the Party incurring the same, including legal and accounting fees, costs and
expenses.

 



 

(b) Seller shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (i) any
Tax period ending prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of any
Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. Buyer shall be
allocated and bear all Asset Taxes attributable to (x) any Tax period
beginning at or after the Effective Time and (y) the portion of any Straddle
Period beginning at the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) For purposes of determining the allocations described in _Section
16.2(b)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production
of Hydrocarbons (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (iii) below)
shall be allocated to the period (or portion thereof) in which the severance

are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional
basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in clause (i) above or (iii)
below), shall be allocated to

shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period ending

Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of an
Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant
to _Section 3.6_, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to
the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset Tax
that is allocable to such Party under this _Section 16.2_.

 



 

(e) Subject to Buyers indemnification rights under _Article XIII_, after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (i) be responsible for paying any Asset Taxes
relating to any Tax period that ends before or includes the Effective Time
that become due and payable after the Closing Date and shall file with the
appropriate Governmental Authority any and all Tax Returns required to be
filed after the Closing Date with respect to such Asset Taxes, (ii) submit
each such Tax Return to Seller for its review and comment reasonably in
advance of the due date therefor, (iii) timely file any such Tax Return
incorporating any reasonable comments received from Seller prior to the due
date therefor, and (iv) provide a copy of each such Tax Return, as filed, to
Seller reasonably promptly after the filing thereof. The Parties agree that
(A) this _Section 16.2(e)_ is intended to solely address the timing and
manner in which certain Tax Returns relating to Asset Taxes are filed and the
Asset Taxes shown thereon are paid to the applicable taxing authority, and (B)
nothing in this _Section 16.2(e)_ shall be interpreted as altering the manner
in which Asset Taxes are allocated to and economically borne by both the
Parties (except for any penalties, interest or additions to Tax imposed as a
result of any breach by Buyer of its obligations under this _Section
16.2(e)_, which shall be borne by Buyer).

 



 

(f) The transactions described in this Agreement involve the transfer of real
estate with tangible personal property, if any, being transferred incidental
to such real estate; accordingly, the Parties do not anticipate that any
sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary, registration or similar Taxes will
be incurred or imposed with respect to the transactions described in this
Agreement (collectively " ** _Transfer Taxes_** "). To the extent that any
Transfer Taxes are imposed on the purchase and sale of the Assets pursuant to
this Agreement, Buyer shall bear and pay such Transfer Taxes. Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes.

 



       
 

 



 

(g) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to
the Assets. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information that are relevant to
any such Tax Return or audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided under this Agreement. The
Parties agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Assets relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations of the
respective Tax periods and to abide by all record retention agreements entered
into by either Party with any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(h) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an
allocation of the Purchase Price and any other items properly treated as
consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes among the Assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder and, to the extent allowed under applicable federal
income tax Law, in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values, within
thirty (30) days after the date that the Final Settlement Statement is
delivered pursuant to _Section 3.6_. If Seller and Buyer reach an agreement
with respect to the allocation, (i) Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to update the allocation in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code following any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, report consistently with the allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax Returns,
including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement
under Section 1060), which Buyer and Seller shall timely file with the IRS,
and neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any position on any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with the allocation, as adjusted, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law; provided, however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably
impeded in its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle
any Tax audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with such
allocation.

 



 

 ** _16.3_** **_Assignment._** Subject to the provisions of _Section 16.17_,
this Agreement may not be assigned by either Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party. In the event the other Party consents to any such
assignment, such assignment shall not relieve the assigning Party of any
obligations and responsibilities hereunder, including obligations and
responsibilities arising following such assignment. Any assignment or other
transfer by either Party or its successors and assigns of any of the Assets
shall not relieve such Party or its successors or assigns of any of their
obligations (including indemnity obligations) hereunder, as to the Assets so
assigned or transferred.

 



 

 ** _16.4_** **_Preparation of Agreement._** Both Seller and Buyer and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the
event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on
the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _16.5_** **_Publicity._** Seller and Buyer shall promptly consult with
each other with regard to all press releases or other public or private
announcements issued or made at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, and, except as may be required by
applicable Laws or the applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Authority or stock exchange, neither Buyer nor Seller shall issue any such
press release or other public or private announcement without the prior
written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Parties shall be obligated to hold all specific terms and
provisions of this Agreement strictly confidential until the expiration of the
two (2)-year period after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not (a) restrict disclosures by Buyer or Seller that are
required by applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing
Party or its Affiliates, _provided_ that such disclosures shall be made only
to the extent required thereunder, (b) prevent Buyer or Seller from recording
the Assignment and any federal or state assignments delivered at Closing or
from complying with any disclosure requirements of Governmental Authorities
that are applicable to the transfer of the Assets from Seller to Buyer, (c)
prevent Buyer or Seller from making any disclosure of information relating to
this Agreement if made in a manner, under conditions and to Persons that would
be permitted under the Confidentiality Agreement so long as such Person
continues to hold such information confidential on the same terms as set forth
in this _Section 16.5_ and (d) prevent Seller from making disclosures in
connection with complying with Preferential Purchase Rights and other transfer
restrictions applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 16.5_, any Party or
Affiliate of a Party may disclose information regarding the Assets in investor
presentations, industry conference presentations or similar disclosures to the
extent that such information has previously been publicly released in
compliance with this Section.

 



 

 ** _16.6_** **_Notices._** All notices and communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be
delivered personally, or sent by bonded overnight courier, or mailed by U.S.
Express Mail, Federal Express or United Parcel Service Express Delivery or by
certified or registered United States Mail with all postage fully prepaid, or
sent by facsimile transmission ( _provided_ any such facsimile transmission is
confirmed either orally or by written confirmation), or sent by electronic
mail (" ** _email_** ") transmission ( _provided_ that receipt of such email
is requested and received, excluding automatic receipts) addressed to the
appropriate Party at the address for such Party shown below or at such other

Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and
the expiration date of such period during which notice is required to be given
or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party may deliver notice of breach of

 ** _16.7_** **_Further Cooperation._** After Closing, Buyer and Seller shall
execute and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, from time to
time such further instruments of conveyance and transfer, and shall take such
other actions as any Party may reasonably request, to convey and deliver the
Assets to Buyer, to perfect Buyers title thereto, and to accomplish the
orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

 ** _16.8_** **_Filings, Notices and Certain Governmental Approvals._**
Promptly after Closing, Buyer shall (a) record the Assignment and all other
assignments executed at Closing in the records of the applicable Governmental
Authority (including any federal or state agencies, if applicable), (b) if
applicable, send notices to vendors supplying goods and services for the
Assets and to the operator of such Assets of the assignment of such Assets to
Buyer, (c) actively pursue the unconditional approval of all applicable
Governmental Authorities of the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and (d)
actively pursue all other consents and approvals that may be required in
connection with the assignment of the Assets to Buyer and the assumption of
the Liabilities

 



      
 

 



 

assumed by Buyer hereunder, in each case, that shall not have been obtained
prior to Closing. Buyer obligates itself to take any and all action required
by any Governmental Authority in order to obtain such unconditional approval,
including the posting of any and all bonds or other security that may be
required in excess of its existing lease, pipeline or area-wide bond.

 



 

 ** _16.9_** **_Entire Agreement; Conflicts._** THIS AGREEMENT, THE
APPENDICES, EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES HERETO, THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS AND THE
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT COLLECTIVELY CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR
AGREEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, OF THE PARTIES PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THERE ARE NO
WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES RELATING
TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, AND NEITHER SELLER NOR BUYER SHALL BE
BOUND BY OR LIABLE FOR ANY ALLEGED REPRESENTATION, PROMISE, INDUCEMENT OR
STATEMENTS OF INTENTION NOT SO SET FORTH. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN
(A) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO OR (B) THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE TERMS
AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; _PROVIDED_ ,
_HOWEVER_ , THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OR
ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
_SECTION 16.9_.

 



 

 ** _16.10_** **_Parties in Interest._** The terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Seller and Buyer
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other
than the Parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, or the
Parties respective related Indemnified Parties hereunder any rights,
remedies, obligations or Liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ that only a Party and its successors and permitted assigns will
have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own behalf
or on behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not be
obligated to do so).

 



 

 ** _16.11_** **_Amendment._** This Agreement may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified only by an instrument in writing executed
by both Parties and expressly identified as an amendment, restatement,
supplement or modification.

 



 

 ** _16.12_** **_Waiver; Rights Cumulative._** Any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by a
written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving compliance.
No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Buyer or their respective
officers, employees, agents, or representatives, and no failure by Seller or
Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement, shall, in any such case,
operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Party at a
later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by any
Party of any condition, or any breach of any term, covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be
deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any
other term, covenant, representation or warranty. The rights of Seller and
Buyer under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

 



 

 ** _16.13_** **_Governing Law; Jurisdiction._**

 



 

(a) This Agreement and any claim, controversy or dispute arising under or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or the
rights, duties and relationship of the parties hereto and thereto, shall be
governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas, excluding any conflicts of law, rule or principle that might
refer construction of provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum for
any disputes between any of the Parties arising out of this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in any
state or federal court in Harris County, Texas and each of the Parties
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts solely in respect of
any proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties
further agree that the Parties shall not bring suit with respect to any
disputes arising out of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction other than the
above specified courts. The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by
Law, that a final and nonappealable judgment against a Party in any action or
proceeding contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any
other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 



 

(c) To the extent that any Party or any of its Affiliates has acquired, or
hereafter may acquire, any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any
legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect
to itself or its property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of any court described in _Section 16.13(b)_.

 



 

(d) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED
HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 



 

 ** _16.14_** **_Severability._** If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the

 



      
 

 



 

economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

 ** _16.15_** **_Removal of Name._** As promptly as practicable, but in any
case within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the
names "QStar LLC", "QStar Operating LLC", "QStar" and any variants of the
foregoing from the Assets and, except with respect to such grace period for
eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos, trademarks
or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 ** _16.16_** **_Counterparts._** This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an
original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all
purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by facsimile
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

 



 

 ** _16.17_** **_Like-Kind Exchange._** Buyer and Seller agree that either or
both of Seller and Buyer may elect to treat the acquisition or sale of the
Assets as an exchange of like-kind property under Section 1031 of the Code (an
" ** _Exchange_** "); _provided_ that the Closing shall not be delayed by
reason of the Exchange. Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the other Party in the completion of such an Exchange including
an Exchange subject to the procedures outlined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1031(k)-1 and/or Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37. Each
of Seller and Buyer shall have the right at any time prior to Closing to
assign all or a part of its rights under this Agreement to a qualified
intermediary (as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii)) or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term
is defined in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure 2000-37) to effect an
Exchange. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that neither an assignment of a
Partys rights under this Agreement nor any other actions taken by a Party or
any other person in connection with the Exchange shall release any Party from,
or modify, any of its liabilities and obligations (including indemnity
obligations to each other) under this Agreement, and no Party makes any
representations as to any particular tax treatment that may be afforded to any
other Party by reason of such assignment or any other actions taken in
connection with the Exchange. Any Party electing to treat the acquisition or
sale of the Assets as an Exchange shall be obligated to pay all additional
costs incurred hereunder as a result of the Exchange, and in consideration for
the cooperation of the other Party, the Party electing Exchange treatment
shall agree to pay all costs associated with the Exchange and to indemnify and
hold the other Party, its Affiliates, and their respective former, current and
future partners, members, shareholders, owners, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents and representatives harmless from and against any and all
liabilities and taxes arising out of, based upon, attributable to or resulting
from the Exchange or transactions or actions taken in connection with the
Exchange that would not have been incurred by the other Party but for the
electing Partys Exchange election.

 



 

 ** _16.18_** **_Specific Performance_**. The Parties agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed by a Party in accordance with
their specific terms, the other Party

 



      
 

 



 

shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy available at law or in equity.
