in accordance with such Payoff Letters and this Agreement);

 

(b) Purchaser shall pay all Company Transaction Expenses by wire transfer of

_however_ , that with respect to any such amounts to be paid to personnel of

direction of Sellers Representative prior to the Closing, pay such amounts to

2.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) _Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable, and in any event within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Sellers Representative a
statement (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement_ ") of (A) Cash and
Cash Equivalents, (B) Net Working Capital, (C) Closing Indebtedness, (D)
Company Transaction Expenses and (E) the KSA Net Asset Amount, which, in each
case, sets forth in reasonable detail Purchasers basis for such calculations.

 

(ii) After receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, Sellers
Representative shall have sixty (60) days to review it. To the extent
reasonably required to complete its review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
Statement, Sellers Representative and its Representatives shall have access
during normal business hours to the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably required for such review. Sellers
Representative shall deliver notice (the " _Closing Date Statement Notice_ ")
to Purchaser on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day after receipt of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement (the " _Notice Period_ ") either (A)
specifying in reasonable detail all disputed items and a summary of the basis
therefor or (B) accepting Purchasers Closing Date Balance Sheet
Statement. If Sellers Representative delivers the Closing Date Statement
Notice notifying Purchaser of any objections to the Closing Date Balance Sheet
Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, Sellers
Representative and Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days following the
date of such Closing Date Statement Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
attempt to resolve their differences and any written resolution by them as to
any disputed amount will be final and binding for all purposes under this
Agreement. If Sellers Representative notifies Purchaser that it has accepted
the Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, if Sellers Representative and
Purchaser resolve the disputed amount(s) in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, or if Sellers Representative fails to provide the Closing
Date Statement Notice on or prior to the last day of the Notice Period, the
Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement shall be deemed final and binding and
shall be the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement_ " for purposes of
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_.

 

(iii) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period Sellers Representative
and Purchaser have not reached an agreement on any objections with respect to
the Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, then all amounts and issues
remaining in dispute will be submitted by Sellers Representative and
Purchaser to a mutually acceptable independent (i.e., no prior
business relationship with Purchaser, the Company or the Sellers) accounting
firm that is one of the ten

 



26

    

 largest accounting firms in the United States (the " _Neutral Auditor_ ")
for a determination resolving such amounts and issues. Purchaser agrees to
execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter
with respect to the determination to be made by the Neutral Auditor. All fees
and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral
Auditor will be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed
items submitted to the Neutral Auditor by Purchaser or Sellers Representative
that are unsuccessfully disputed by it (as finally determined by the Neutral
Auditor) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of disputed items submitted by
Purchaser and Sellers Representative. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by Purchaser and the Sellers
in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Neutral Auditor
will be borne by the party incurring such cost and expense. The Neutral
Auditor shall determine only those issues still in dispute at the end of the
Resolution Period and the Neutral Auditors determination will be based upon
and consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
determination by the Neutral Auditor will be based solely on presentations
with respect to such disputed items by Purchaser and Sellers Representative
to the Neutral Auditor and not on the Neutral Auditors independent review.
Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to make their respective presentations as promptly as practicable
following submission to the Neutral Auditor of the disputed items (but in no
event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after engagement of the Neutral
Auditor), and each of Purchaser and Sellers Representative will be entitled,
as part of its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the other and
any questions and requests of the Neutral Auditor. In deciding any matter, the
Neutral Auditor (A) will be bound by the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
2.7(a)_ and (B) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Purchaser or Sellers Representative or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by Purchaser or Sellers
Representative.

(iv) The Neutral Auditors determination will be made within forty-five (45)
days after its engagement (which engagement will be made no later than five
(5) Business Days after the end of the Resolution Period), or as soon
thereafter as possible, will be set forth in a written statement delivered
to Sellers Representative and Purchaser and will be final, binding, non-
appealable, and enforceable as an arbitration award in any court of competent
jurisdiction under the terms of the Federal Arbitration Act or its state law
equivalents for all purposes hereunder; _provided_ that such determination may
be reviewed, corrected or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, but
only upon a finding that the Neutral Auditor committed manifest error with
respect to its determination. The term " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet
Statement_ " means the definitive Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement deemed
to be the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(ii)_ or the definitive Closing Date Balance Sheet
Statement resulting from the determination made by the Neutral Auditor in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(iv)_, as applicable. 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(i) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

 

(A) _Downward Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital, as set forth on the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, is less than the estimated Net
Working

 



27

    

 Capital, as set forth on the Closing Payment Statement, the Aggregate
Purchase Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
shortfall.

(B)  _Upward Adjustment_. If the Net Working Capital, as set forth on the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, is greater than the estimated Net
Working Capital, as set forth on the Closing Payment Statement, the Aggregate
Purchase Price will be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
excess.

 

(ii) _Cash and Cash Equivalents Adjustment_.

 

(A) _Downward Adjustment_. If Cash and Cash Equivalents, as set forth on the

Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, are greater than the estimated
Cash and Cash Equivalents, as set forth on the Closing Payment Statement, the

such excess.

(iii)  _Indebtedness Adjustment_.

(A) _Downward Adjustment_. If Closing Indebtedness, as set forth on the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, is greater than the estimated Closing
Indebtedness, as set forth on the Closing Payment Statement, the Aggregate
Purchase Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
excess.

(B)  _Upward Adjustment_. If Closing Indebtedness, as set forth on the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, is less than the estimated Closing
Indebtedness, as set forth on the Closing Payment Statement, the Aggregate
Purchase Price will be increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such
shortfall.

 

(iv) _Company Transaction Expenses Adjustment_.

 

(A) _Downward Adjustment_. If Company Transaction Expenses, as set forth on
the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, are greater than the
estimated Company Transaction Expenses, as set forth on the Closing Payment
Statement, the Aggregate Purchase Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by
the amount of such excess.

(B) _Upward Adjustment_. If Company Transaction Expenses, as set forth on the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement, are less than the estimated
Company Transaction Expenses, as set forth on the Closing Payment Statement,

The amount of any decrease to the Aggregate Purchase Price, pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_, shall be paid to Purchaser in cash from the funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account, which shall be Purchasers sole source of
recovery for any such decrease to the Aggregate Purchase Price. The amount of
any increase to the Aggregate Purchase Price, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)_, shall be

 



28

    

 paid by Purchaser to the Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Percentages set forth in the Allocation Schedule, to the bank accounts
designated by Sellers Representative in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule, by wire transfer in immediately available funds; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the portion of any such payment to Stock Seller by Purchaser
shall be adjusted by any amount due to or from Stock Seller pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)_. Within three (3) Business Days after the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet Statement is deemed final in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(ii)_ or determined by the Neutral Auditor in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7(a)(iv)_, (1) Purchaser shall make any
payment required thereby pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.7(b)_ and (2)
Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent in

(ii) If the KSA Net Asset Amount, as set forth on the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet Statement, is less than the estimated KSA Net Asset Amount, as

with the Allocation Schedule, will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the
amount of such shortfall and such amount shall reduce any amount required to
be paid by Purchaser to Stock Seller in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.7(b)_; provided, however, that if such KSA Net Asset Amount shortfall
exceeds the amount to be paid to Stock Seller by Purchaser, then Stock Seller
shall pay the amount of such excess directly to Purchaser.

 

(d) _Adjustment of the Aggregate Purchase Price; Exclusive Remedy_. Payment of
any amount owed pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and the arbitration provisions
contemplated hereby shall be the exclusive remedy and exclusive forum of the
parties with respect to the matters that are or that may be addressed through
the purchase price adjustments contemplated hereby.

2.8 _Escrow Agreement_. Purchaser and Sellers Representative shall, at the
Closing, execute an Escrow Agreement, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit_ __ _ D_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), which provides for the
Adjustment Escrow Amount to be held in escrow following the Closing Date and
to be disbursed in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ and the terms of the

29

    

2.9 _Withholding_. Purchaser or its paying agents shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such

Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Purchaser or
its paying agents, such deducted and withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted
by Purchaser or its paying agents (or its designated Person) to the applicable
Governmental Authority and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. If Purchaser determines that any such
deduction or withholding is so required, Purchaser shall use reasonable best
efforts to promptly (and no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
date on which such payment is made) notify each applicable Person of any
intention to so deduct and withhold and provide such Person the opportunity to
provide any statement, form, or other documentation that would reduce
or eliminate any such requirement to deduct and withhold, and cooperate with
such Person as reasonably requested with respect to the filing of any Tax
Return or conduct of any claim relating to any available refund of such amount
remitted. Each Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and shall
provide such information as reasonably necessary for Purchaser to determine
whether any amounts are so required to be deducted and withheld.

 

2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation._ __

 

(a) No later than sixty (60) days after the determination of Net Working
Capital (as finally determined pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_), Purchaser
shall deliver to Sellers Representative an allocation of the portion of the
Aggregate Purchase Price allocated to the Purchased Units among the Company
assets in a manner consistent with the applicable provisions of the Code and
the methodologies set forth on _Schedule 2.10(a)_ (the " _Purchaser s Draft
Allocation_"). If Sellers Representative disagrees with the Purchasers Draft
Allocation, the Sellers Representative may, within fifteen (15) Business
Days after delivery of the Purchasers Draft Allocation, deliver a notice ("
_Sellers  Allocation Notice_") to Purchaser to such effect, specifying
those items as to which Sellers Representative disagrees, the reasons for
such disagreement, and Sellers Representatives proposed allocation of the
portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price allocated to the Purchased Units.
If Sellers Representative does not timely deliver a Sellers Allocation
Notice, Sellers Representative will be deemed to have agreed to the
Purchasers Draft Allocation. If Sellers Allocation Notice is delivered to
Purchaser within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, Sellers
Representative and Purchaser will negotiate in good faith for a period not to
exceed twenty (20) Business Days from the receipt of Sellers Allocation
Notice to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine the allocation. If agreement is not reached within such twenty (20)
Business Day period, the Purchasers Draft Allocation, with Sellers
Allocation Notice, shall be submitted to the Neutral Auditor for resolution.
The determination by the Neutral Auditor shall be final and binding upon the
parties absent manifest error, and the costs incurred in retaining the Neutral
Auditor shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser and fifty percent
(50%) by the Sellers Representative.

(b) Once all adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price have been made
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, and all disagreements, if any, regarding the
Purchasers Draft Allocation have been resolved as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.10(a)_, the parties shall amend the allocation of the Aggregate Purchase
Price allocated to the Purchased Units, consistent with the allocations
described in this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, to reflect any appropriate
adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price (the " _Final Purchase Price
Allocation_ ").

 



30

    

(c) The parties hereby undertake and agree to timely file any Tax Return that
may be required to be filed pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 1060(b) of the Code or any other applicable Law. Neither party
shall file any Tax Return or other document or otherwise take any position
which is inconsistent with the Final Purchase Price Allocation determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_, except as may be adjusted by
subsequent agreement following an audit by the IRS or any other Governmental
Authority or by an Order;  _provided_ , that neither party (nor their
respective Affiliates) shall be obligated to litigate any challenge to such
allocation by any Governmental Authority. The parties hereto shall promptly
inform one another of any challenge by any Governmental Authority to the
Final Purchase Price Allocation and agree to consult with and keep one another
informed with respect to the state of, and any discussion, proposal or
submission with respect to, such challenge.

of the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, all fees required to be paid
under the Commitment Letter prior to the date hereof have been paid in full.
Guarantor and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that under the terms of this
Agreement, Purchasers obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to
Guarantors and Purchasers consummation of any financing arrangements,
Guarantor or Purchasers obtaining any financing or the availability, grant,

not, without the Companys prior written consent, agree to any amendment or

least as favorable to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Purchaser as those
contained therein prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver; _provided_ , that Purchaser may, without the Companys prior written
consent, enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter or any

of doubt, so long as the Company has not less than five (5) Business Days to
furnish such information); and

(iv) providing customary authorization letters authorizing the distribution
of information to prospective lenders and containing a customary
representation to the Financing Parties for the Financing that such
information does not contain a material misstatement or omission.

interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries;

(iii) take any action or provide any information that will conflict with or
violate its organizational documents, any Contract by which such Person is
bound or any applicable Laws, or (in the case of the disclosure of
information) would result in the waiver of any legal privilege (provided,
however, that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
provide an alternative means of disclosing or providing such information to
the maximum extent permitted by Law or to the maximum extent that does
not result in a loss of such legal privilege, as applicable, and in the event
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not provide access or
information in reliance on this clause, the Company shall provide notice to
Purchaser that information is being withheld);

will not be employed thereby immediately after Closing with Persons
designated by Purchaser and to add any officers and directors designated by
Purchaser, such replacements and additions to become effective immediately at
Closing;

 



69

    

(vi) cause the execution of any certificates or other documents (other than
customary authorization and representation letters) by any employee whose
employment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will terminate prior to
or upon Closing or that are effective prior to the Closing (other than
customary authorization and representation letters);

(vii) take any action or provide any assistance pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.6_ that would reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to
a director or officer or cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Documents to be breached or to become inaccurate;
or

 

(viii) take any action or provide any assistance that involves preparing or
providing to Purchaser or any financing sources any financial statements or
other information that is not available to the Company and prepared in the
ordinary course of its financial reporting practice.

In addition, no action, liability or obligation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (other than
customary authorization and representation letters) relating to the Financing
will be required to be effective until the Closing Date.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Guarantor and Purchaser
will be permitted to disclose any information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to any
Financing Parties, prospective Financing Parties and lenders under the
Existing Purchaser Debt (and, in each case, to their respective
Representatives) so long as such information is furnished by Guarantor or
Purchaser subject to customary confidentiality undertakings or arrangements in
connection with the Financing or the Existing Purchaser Debt, as applicable.
The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing and the Existing Debt Joinders,
provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is reasonable and
customary for such purposes and that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective products, services, offerings or intellectual property rights.

(e) Purchaser shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, but excluding the costs of the Companys preparation of its annual and
quarterly financial statements) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _
6.6(b)_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with any cooperation pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ and any information used in connection therewith,
except with respect to (i) any information provided in writing by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with the Financing (to the
extent used as it was provided) or (ii) any fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, gross negligence or willful misconduct by any such persons
or material breach by any such persons of their obligations under this
Agreement.

the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company or its
Subsidiaries for such insurance and (ii) if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount described in the foregoing
clause (i), then Purchaser, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary shall
obtain a policy which, in its good faith determination, provides the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(c) If Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser, the
Company or any such Subsidiary of the Company shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified
Parties, who are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_.

 

(e) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
shall be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have
under the organizational documents of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or laws. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any DandO Indemnified Party
as provided in the organizational documents of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such DandO Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the
consummation of the transactions

 



72

    

 contemplated hereby and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such DandO
Indemnified Party.

 

7.3 _Personnel Matters_ _._

 

(a) Purchaser agrees that, consistent with applicable Law, (i) during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st)
anniversary thereof, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
continues employment with Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
after the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") will be provided with (A)
base salary or wages that are no less favorable than those provided to each
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (B) severance
benefits which are no less favorable than those provided to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (C) health and
welfare benefits and other employee benefits (excluding equity and equity
based arrangements, retiree welfare and defined pension benefit plans)
substantially similar in the aggregate to such health and welfare benefits
and other employee benefits made available to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and (ii) during the period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on March 31, 2021, the Continuing Employees will
be provided with cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than
those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing (and, for the avoidance of doubt, cash bonuses for the 2020 calendar
year shall be paid on or before February 28, 2021 in accordance with the
Companys or the applicable Subsidiarys bonus plan as of the Closing);
provided, further, that the cash bonuses for the period beginning on January
1, 2021 and ending on March 31, 2021 shall be paid on or before June 30, 2021
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, so long as the applicable employee remains
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries through March 31, 2021, there
shall be no requirement of employment through June 30, 2021 for receipt of
such bonus, notwithstanding the terms of any applicable bonus plans).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Continuing Employees will only be eligible
to participate in the STERIS Corporation 401(k) Plan (" _STERIS 401(k) Plan_
") effective on the first day of the payroll period that begins after the
Continuing Employees have been continuously employed by an ERISA Affiliate of
Purchaser for a period of ninety (90) days and otherwise in accordance with
the terms of the STERIS 401(k) Plan.

(b) Purchaser shall cause any employee benefit plan providing for paid time
off in which the Continuing Employees are entitled to participate after the
Closing to take into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, and level
of benefits thereunder, service for the Company and its Subsidiaries as if
such service were with Purchaser, to the same extent such service was credited
under a comparable paid time off plan of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
(except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, and
except for accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), and not for
purposes of any other Benefit Plan of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
including any short-term disability benefit provided by the Purchaser.

 

(c) Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to
the Closing a general release of claims in favor of the Company and its
Subsidiaries from each Incentive Unit Holder and the Phantom Unit Holder with
respect to any payments such Incentive Unit Holder or the Phantom Unit Holder
will receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ of this Agreement, including:
(i) an acknowledgement by the holder that any payment received under this
Agreement in exchange for any Incentive Units or Phantom Units then held by
such holder is in full

 



73

    

 satisfaction of any obligations of the Company or its Affiliates to the
holder with respect to such Incentive Units or Phantom Units, as applicable,
and (ii) an indemnity by which each Incentive Unit Holder and the Phantom
Unit Holder holds the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any Taxes
payable by such Incentive Unit Holder or the Phantom Unit Holder, as
applicable. Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser drafts of the form of release
to be provided to Incentive Unit Holders and the Phantom Unit Holder in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ promptly following the date
hereof, and Sellers shall incorporate any revisions reasonably requested
by Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt,
obtaining the release from the Incentive Unit Holders and the Phantom Unit
Holder as described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(c)_ is not a condition to
Closing.

 

(d) The Company shall terminate the Key Surgical LLC 401(k) Profit Sharing
Plan and Trust and any other Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), effective no later than
the day prior to the Closing. In advance of any such termination, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser drafts of any corporate actions to be taken to
terminate any such Company 401(k) Plans, and the Company shall incorporate any
revisions reasonably requested by Purchaser within three (3) Business Days
before adoption. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to, prepare and file
with the IRS an Application for Determination for Terminating Plan on Form
5310 and, if necessary, in the opinion of the Purchaser, a submission to the
IRS under the Voluntary Correction with the Internal Revenue Service Approval
Program of the Employee Plan Compliance Resolution System with respect to each
Company 401(k) Plan, and will prepare and file all other information required
to be submitted in connection therewith, in accordance with applicable IRS
requirements, including requirements concerning Notices to Interested Parties.
The Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall cause proper
administration of each such Company 401(k) Plan to continue during the
pendency of the IRS determination request, and will take all such other
actions as may be reasonably necessary to obtain a favorable determination
letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall oversee
termination distributions from each such Company 401(k) Plan, in accordance
with the terms of the respective Benefit Plan documents. Any such Benefit Plan
which is a defined benefit plan covered by Title IV of ERISA shall be
terminated with the PBGC as a Standard Termination on PBGC Form 500.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are for the sole benefit of
the parties and shall not (i) be deemed to constitute the adoption, amendment
or modification of any employee benefit plan, including the Benefit Plans, or
limit the right of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to amend or
terminate any employee benefit plan, including the Benefit Plans, (ii) limit
the right of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to terminate any employee
at any time and for any reason (subject to severance and other related
obligations as set forth herein), or (iii) create any third party beneficiary
other rights in any other Person, including for the avoidance of doubt any
employee, former employee, employee representative, or any participant in any
employee benefit plan of Sellers, Purchaser or any of its or their Affiliates,
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof.

 

7.4 _WARN Act Notice_. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing any
notice required under the WARN Act in respect of the termination after the
Closing of the employment of any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries located in the United States, and shall indemnify and hold the
Sellers harmless from any liability arising from any failure 

 



74

    

 of Purchaser to comply fully with the foregoing covenant; provided, however,
that as of the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with true and
accurate information regarding any employee who was involuntarily terminated
in the six (6) months prior to the Closing Date, including the effective date
of the termination, the reason for termination, and the employees work
location. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _
7.4_, Purchaser shall not be responsible for any WARN liability resulting from
Sellers failure to comply with their obligation to provide true and accurate
information consistent with this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

7.5 _Preparation of Tax Returns_ _._  

(a) Sellers Representative, at the sole cost and expense of the Sellers,
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be
timely filed any Tax Returns of each of KSA Inc., KSA LLC, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case, for any Tax period that ends on or before the
Closing Date (and any amendments thereto) to be filed before, on, or after
the Closing Date (a " _Seller Prepared Tax Return_ "). To the extent that a
Seller Prepared Tax Return needs to be filed after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause KSA Inc., KSA LLC, or the Company (or its applicable Subsidiary),
as the case may be, to file such Tax Return. At least thirty (30) days prior
to the due date of any Seller Prepared Tax Return that is an income Tax Return
(" _Seller Prepared Income Tax Return_ ") due after the Closing Date that
needs to be filed by KSA Inc., KSA LLC, or the Company (or its applicable
Subsidiary), as the case may be, Sellers Representative shall submit such
Seller Prepared Income Tax Return to Purchaser for Purchasers review and
comments. Purchaser will provide any comments to Sellers Representative as
promptly as practicable (and not later than ten (10) days after receiving any
such Seller Prepared Income Tax Return) and, if Purchaser does not provide
any comments within ten (10) days, Purchaser will be deemed to have accepted
such Seller Prepared Income Tax Return. Sellers Representative shall accept
all reasonable comments provided by Purchaser with respect to any Seller
Prepared Income Tax Return submitted to Purchaser for review and comments.
Prior to the due date for any Seller Prepared Income Tax Return, Sellers
Representative, on one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall work
together in good faith to resolve any disagreements with respect to such
Seller Prepared Income Tax Return. Prior to the due date of any Seller
Prepared Tax Return that is due to be filed after the Closing, Purchaser shall
cause KSA Inc., KSA LLC, or the Company (or its applicable Subsidiary), as
the case may be, to sign and timely file such Seller Prepared Tax Return,
taking into account all changes to which parties agreed in the process of
resolving any disagreements with respect to any Seller Prepared Income Tax
Return. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law or provided for in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow the Company (or any
of its Subsidiaries) to, amend any Seller Prepared Tax Return or otherwise
initiate (or agree to) any other Seller Representative Tax Matter without the
prior written consent of Sellers Representative (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). The parties agree that the applicable
Seller Prepared Tax Returns (i) shall include any deductions with respect to
the Transaction Deductions and other items incurred by the Sellers, and (ii)
to the extent applicable, shall include an election under Revenue Procedure
2011-29. 

(b) From and after the Closing, except for Seller Prepared Tax Returns
described in _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_, Purchaser shall be responsible for the
preparation of all Tax Returns for KSA Inc., KSA LLC, the Company and its
Subsidiaries. At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any IRS Form
1065 (or similar form for state and local Tax purposes) of the Company that
relates to a Straddle Period (a " _Purchaser Prepared Income Tax Return_ "),
Purchaser shall

 



75

    

 submit such Purchaser Prepared Income Tax Return to Sellers Representative
for Sellers Representatives review and comments. Sellers Representative
will provide any comments to Purchaser as promptly as practicable (and not
later than ten (10) days after receiving any such Purchaser Prepared Income
Tax Return) and, if Sellers Representative does not provide any comments
within ten (10) days, Sellers Representative will be deemed to have accepted
such Purchaser Prepared Income Tax Return. Purchaser shall accept all
reasonable comments provided by Sellers Representative with respect to any
Purchaser Prepared Income Tax Return submitted to Sellers Representative for
review and comments. Prior to the due date for any Purchaser Prepared Income
Tax Return, Sellers Representative, on one hand, and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall work together in good faith to resolve any disagreements with
respect to such Purchaser Prepared Income Tax Return. The parties agree that
the applicable Purchaser Prepared Income Tax Returns (x) shall include any
deductions with respect to the Transaction Deductions and other items
incurred by the Sellers (with such deductions allocated to the pre-closing
portion of such tax period), and (y) to the extent applicable, shall include
an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29. Except as otherwise taken into
account in calculating the Aggregate Purchase Price (including any adjustments
under Section 2.7), from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall be responsible
for the payment of all Taxes due and owing with respect to KSA Inc., KSA LLC,
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention for the full period of any statute of limitations and (upon any
other partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

 

(d) To the extent permissible under applicable Laws, the parties agree to
elect (and have KSA Inc., KSA LLC, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
elect) to have each Tax year of the applicable entity end on the Closing Date
and, if such election is not permitted or required in a jurisdiction with
respect to a specific Tax such that KSA Inc., KSA LLC, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, to
utilize the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date:
(i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes,
sales Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined as if each applicable entity filed a separate Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology"
(and for such purpose, the taxable year of any partnership or other pass-
through entity or any controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of
Section 957 of the Code in which the Company holds a beneficial interest shall
be deemed to end on the Closing Date). For purposes of applying the 

 



76

    

 foregoing, (A) any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including
amortization and depreciation deductions) for income Tax purposes shall be
allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
based on the relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as
compared to the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; (B) any Tax or
item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit from a Purchaser Closing Date
Transaction shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
on the day after the Closing Date; and (C) any item of deduction attributable
to any Transaction Deductions shall be allocated to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.

7.6 _No Section_ __ _ 338 Election_. No party hereto nor any Affiliate
thereof shall make an election under Section 338 of the Code or any similar
provision of foreign, state or local Law in respect of the purchase and sale
of the Purchased Equity, any assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.7 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne equally by
Sellers and Purchaser, and the parties shall cooperate in the filing of all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes.

7.8 _Section 6226 Election and Section_ __ _ 754 Election_.

 

(a) _Section 6226 Election_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers and the Sellers Representative will not, and will not
permit any other Person to, elect under Section 1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan
Budget Act of 2015 to have the amendments made by such provisions apply to any
income Tax Return of the Company with respect to any Tax period beginning on
or before December 31, 2017. The Sellers and Sellers Representative agree
that if the IRS (or applicable state Governmental Authority) issues a notice
of final partnership adjustment assessing an "imputed underpayment" against
the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any Tax period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date beginning after December 31, 2017, or any Tax period
beginning on or before December 31, 2017 for which an election under Section
1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was made, the Company or
Subsidiary (as applicable) shall make the election under Section 6226 of the
Code (or any similar provision of Law) and the Sellers and Sellers
Representative agree to cooperate, and to cause its respective Affiliates and
the "partnership representative" and "designated individual" (as those terms
are used in Section 6223 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section
301.6223-1(b)(3) (or any similar provision of Law)) of the Company or
Subsidiary (as applicable), to cooperate with Purchaser and its Affiliates, in
making such election, including by timely providing information reasonably
requested by Purchaser or the Company and assisting the Company or Subsidiary
(as applicable) in the preparation of any statements or other information
required to be provided to the IRS or any other Person as required by Section
6226 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (or any
similar provision of Law).

(b) Purchaser will keep the Sellers and Sellers Representative informed of
all administrative and judicial proceedings relating to any Tax period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date beginning after December 31, 2017, or any Tax
period beginning on or before December 31, 2017 for which an election under
Section 1101(g)(4) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 was made, for which
the Company or any Subsidiary (as applicable) intends to make the election
(a 

 



77

    

 "push out election") under Section 6226 of the Code (or any similar
provision of Law). The Company and Purchaser shall (i) promptly after
receiving any written or oral notice from the IRS or any state or local
taxing authority regarding Taxes of the Company or any meeting or other
proceeding regarding such Taxes, furnish a copy of such written communication
or notice or inform Sellers and Sellers Representative in writing of the
substance of any such oral communication, (ii) keep Sellers and Sellers
Representative apprised of the commencement, development and settlement of
each audit, administrative hearing, or other proceedings regarding the
Companys tax matters, and (iii) shall make no concession to, or agreement
with, the IRS concerning such Tax period which could increase the potential
Tax liability of any Seller affected by the pushout election, without first
consulting with the Sellers or Sellers Representative.

(c) _Section 754 Election_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at the discretion of Purchaser, the Company, to the extent an
election under Section 754 of the Code is not already in effect with respect
to the Company, will make an election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code for
the tax year that includes the Closing Date.

7.9 _Prior Tax Agreements_. The Sellers shall terminate or cause to
be terminated any and all of the Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification or
similar agreements, arrangements or undertakings in effect, written or
unwritten, on the Closing Date as between any Seller or Affiliate thereof
(other than between and among KSA Inc., KSA LLC, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and KSA Inc., KSA LLC, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, regardless of the period in which such
Taxes are imposed, and there shall be no continuing obligation to make any
payments under any such agreements, arrangements or undertakings.

7.10 _Interim Operations_. During the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending on, and including, the Closing Date, each of KSA Inc.,
KSA LLC, the Company and each of the Companys Subsidiaries shall not: (i)
make any Tax election, other than in the ordinary course of filing periodic
Tax Returns, (ii) change or rescind any material Tax election, (iii) change or
consent to any change in its method of accounting for Tax purposes (except as
required by applicable Law), (iv) amend any material Tax Return, (v) settle,
compromise, concede or abandon any Tax material liability, claim or
assessment, (vi) enter into any closing agreement with any Governmental
Authority pursuant to Section 1313 of the Code or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign Law, (vii) waive or extend any statute of
limitation with respect to any material Taxes, (viii) obtain any Tax ruling,
or (ix) restructure, capitalize or otherwise modify any intercompany loans, in
each case, without prior written consent from Purchaser (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

7.11 _Non-Competition_ _; Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality_.

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date, each of
OConnell and Milchman shall not (and shall cause his Affiliates not to),
directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world, either for himself or through
any other Person, have an ownership interest in, manage, participate, operate,
control, permit his name to be used by, perform services for or
otherwise become involved in (whether as an officer, director, manager,
employee, investor, partner, proprietor, stockholder, member, trustee,
consultant, agent, representative, broker, promoter or otherwise), any Person
engaging or contemplating engaging in a Competing Business;

 



78

    

  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) nothing shall prohibit OConnell,
Milchman or any of their respective Affiliates from having a passive ownership
interest of not more than two percent (2.0%) of any publicly-traded entity,
so long as no such Person participates in any way in the management, operation
or control of such publicly-traded entity, and (ii) for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing shall prohibit OConnell or Milchman from engaging in any
activities or performing any services on behalf of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, including the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date with
respect to OConnell and Milchman only, and for a period of three (3) years
from and after the Closing Date with respect to each other Restricted Party,
each Restricted Party shall not (and shall cause his or its Affiliates not
to), directly or indirectly, either for himself or itself or through
any other Person, hire, solicit or induce, or attempt to hire, solicit or
induce, any (i) salaried employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries employed
in the United States as of the Closing Date and (ii) employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries employed in Europe in any commercial or strategic role
(including sales and marketing, finance, manufacturing, management RandD,

of the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Key Employees_ ") to leave the
employ of the Company or its Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between any such Key Employee and the Company or its Affiliates;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.11(b)_ shall be deemed to
prohibit any Restricted Party or its Affiliates from hiring, soliciting or
inducing, or attempting to hire, solicit or induce, any Key Employee at any
time following the date such Key Employee is terminated by the Company or any
of its Affiliates.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, each Restricted Party shall hold, and
cause his or its Affiliates to hold, in confidence and not disclose to any
third party and shall not use, and cause his or its Affiliates not to use, for
any purpose, any Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Restricted Party and his or its Affiliates shall be permitted to use
such information (i) as may be reasonably required by such Person in
connection with any Tax audits, governmental investigations or other similar
proceedings involving such Restricted Party or such Affiliates, (ii) to
comply with such Restricted Partys obligations, or to enforce his or its
rights, under this Agreement and each Ancillary Document or (iii) to the
extent such disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law or appropriate
Order. If any Restricted Party or his or its Affiliates is compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information by judicial or administrative process or
by other requirements of applicable Law or appropriate Order, such Restricted
Party shall, if not prohibited by such requirement or Order, promptly notify
Purchaser in writing prior to such disclosure and shall disclose or cause his
or its Affiliates to disclose only that portion of such information that is
legally required to be disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Restricted Party shall, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, reasonably
cooperate with Purchasers efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
such information. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
each Restricted Party and its Affiliates may (A) disclose Confidential

provided by private equity funds with respect to their prior portfolio
companies to past, current or potential limited partners or investors for
fund raising, marketing and/or reporting purposes.

 



79

    

(d) Each Restricted Party agrees that the covenants contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_ are reasonably designed to protect Purchasers
substantial investment and are reasonable with respect to duration, geographic
area and scope. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this _Section_ __ _
7.11_ is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.

 

7.12 _Further Assurances_. Each of the parties hereto shall execute such
further documents and perform or cause to be performed such other further
acts as any other party may reasonably request in order to carry out the

respects as of such particular dates), except (a) for changes or developments

10.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties, and covenants and
agreements to the extent contemplating or requiring performance prior to the
Closing, set forth in

 



81

    

 this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Article VIII_ or
_Article IX_ of this Agreement shall not survive the Closing. Each of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement shall terminate
effective immediately as of the Closing such that no claim for breach of any
such representation or warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or
remedy (whether in contract, in tort or at law or equity) may be brought after
the Closing other than in the case of Fraud. The covenants and agreements of
any party set forth in this Agreement and in any other document delivered in
connection herewith to the extent contemplating or requiring performance by
such party prior to the Closing shall terminate effective immediately as of
the Closing such that no claim for breach of any such covenant,
detrimental reliance or other right or remedy (whether in contract, in tort
or at law or equity) may be brought after the Closing. Each covenant and
agreement in this Agreement which by its terms requires performance at or
after the Closing (the " _Surviving Covenants_ ") shall expressly survive
Closing until fully performed in accordance with its terms and nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall be deemed to limit any rights or remedies of any
Person for breach of any such covenant (with it being understood that
Purchaser shall also be liable for breach of any covenant or agreement
requiring performance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Closing and that nothing herein shall limit or affect Purchasers or any of
its Affiliates liability for the failure to pay the Aggregate Purchase Price
or pay other amounts as required hereunder). Accordingly and for the avoidance
of doubt, following the Closing, except with respect to the Surviving
Covenants and except in the case of Fraud, no party hereto shall have any
liability or obligation of any kind or nature whatsoever to any other party
hereto (whether such liability is based on a theory of breach of
contract (including any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement), tort or otherwise) arising out of or
in any way related to any claim or cause of action with respect to the subject
matter of this Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant to _Article
VIII_ or _Article_ __ _ IX_ and/or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

10.2 _Waiver_.

(a) Each of Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of each of its post-
Closing Affiliates) and the Company acknowledges and agrees that, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the Sellers
or any of their respective post-Closing Affiliates relating to the operation
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries arising under or based upon any Law or otherwise
(including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to
seek indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other
recourse or remedy, including as may arise under common law) are hereby
waived; _provided_ , that nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_
shall release, waive, relinquish, discharge or otherwise affect the rights or
obligations of any party to the extent arising under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents following the Closing. Furthermore, without limiting the
generality of this _Article X_ , except for Fraud, no claim shall be brought
or maintained by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its post-Closing
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
against the Sellers or any of their post-Closing Affiliates, and no recourse
shall be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company, the Sellers or
any other Person set forth

 



82

    

 or contained in this Agreement (other than the Surviving Covenants), any
certificate, instrument, opinion or other documents of the Company or any
other Person delivered hereunder, the subject matter of this Agreement or the
Disclosure Schedule and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, the
business, the ownership, operation, management, use or control of the business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their assets, or any
actions or omissions at or prior to the Closing. Purchaser hereby agrees, on
behalf of itself and each of its post-Closing Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), to indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers and each of their post-Closing Affiliates from and against and in
respect of any and all losses, liabilities, damages or expenses (including
reasonable legal fees) incurred by any Seller or any of its post-Closing
Affiliates as a result of any such claim brought or maintained by Purchaser
or any of its post-Closing Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries) against the Sellers or any of their post-Closing
Affiliates in contravention of this  _Article X_.

(b) Each Restricted Party (on its behalf and on behalf of each of its post-
Closing Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action it may have against the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to the operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses prior to the Closing, or relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby arising under or based upon any Law or
otherwise (including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or other recourse or
remedy, including as may arise under common law) are hereby waived; _provided_
, that nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ shall release, waive,
relinquish, discharge or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any
party to the extent arising under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
following the Closing or any claim of a Restricted Party or its Affiliates to
any rights of indemnification, exculpation, advancement of expenses or
insurance coverage by reason of such Persons service as a manager, director,
officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, if applicable, in
each case, subject to the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any other
contract between such Person and the Company or its Subsidiaries, if
applicable. Each Restricted Party hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and each
of its post-Closing Affiliates, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company
and its Subsidiaries from and against and in respect of any and all losses,
liabilities, damages or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their post-Closing Affiliates as a
result of any such claim brought or maintained by such Restricted Party or any
of its post-Closing Affiliates against the Company or its Subsidiaries in
contravention of this _Article X_.

10.3 _Other Matters_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in this _Article X_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the Sellers
and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, after the consummation of the Closing, no party may seek the
rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers may enforce the rights of any of
their post-Closing Affiliates hereunder, and Sellers acknowledge and agree
that Purchaser may enforce the rights of any of its post-Closing Affiliates
hereunder.

Companys or Sellers Representatives receipt of written notice thereof from
Purchaser; provided that the right of termination pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 11.1(b)_ shall not be available to Purchaser at any time that Purchaser
has violated or is in breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of
Purchaser hereunder if such breach has prevented satisfaction of the such
conditions to Closing hereunder and has not been waived by Sellers
Representative or, if capable of cure, has not been cured by Purchaser;

 

(c) by Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), if there has been a
material breach by Purchaser or Guarantor of any covenant, representation or
warranty of Purchaser or Guarantor contained in this Agreement which has

of the Sellers and the Company at the Closing and such breach has not
been waived by Sellers Representative or cured by Purchaser within twenty
(20) days after Purchasers receipt of written notice thereof from Sellers
Representative or the Company; _provided_ that the right of
termination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.1(c)_ shall not be available
to Sellers Representative at any time that the Company or the Sellers have
violated or are in breach of any covenant, representation or warranty of the
Company or the Sellers (as applicable) hereunder if such breach has prevented
satisfaction of such conditions to Closing hereunder and has not been waived
by Purchaser or, if capable of cure, has not been cured by the Company and/or
the Sellers;  _provided_ _further_ , that the failure of Purchaser to deliver
all or any portion of the Aggregate Purchase Price as required hereunder shall
not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
Sellers Representative;

(d) by Purchaser, if the Closing has not occurred on or before the six (6)
month anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided

(e) by Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), if the Closing has
not occurred on or before the Termination Date; provided that Sellers
Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 11.1(e)_ if the Companys or any Sellers breach of
this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



84

    

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _clauses (b)_ ,
_(c)_ , _(d)_ or  _(e)_ , of this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ shall give written
notice of such termination to the other parties hereto.

 

11.2 _Survival After Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Purchaser or
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) as provided in _Section_
__ _ 11.1_ above, this Agreement (and the provisions hereof) shall
immediately become void and of no further force and effect (other than
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, _Article XII_ and the
Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, each of which shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and shall be enforceable by the parties to this Agreement),
and there shall be no liability on the part of Purchaser, any Seller or the
Company to one another or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except (i) that no such termination shall relieve any such
party from liability for any Willful Breach (as defined below) by such party
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement prior to the time of such termination and (ii) as provided
above, with respect to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_,
_Article XII_ and the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, each of which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and shall be enforceable by the
parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
terminated for any reason, (a) Purchaser shall return or destroy
all documents and other material received from the Company, any Seller and/or
any of their respective representatives relating to the Company, any of its
Affiliates, any of their respective businesses and/or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution of
this Agreement and (b) all confidential information received by Purchaser or
any of its affiliates or representatives with respect to or relating to the
Sellers, the Company, any of their respective Affiliates, any of their
respective businesses and/or any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall

Disclosure Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ "
means a material breach by a party to this Agreement of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by such breaching
party with the actual knowledge of such party that the taking of such act or
failure to take such act by such party would cause a material breach by such
party of any such representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of
such party set forth in this Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 11.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement.

Seller shall split equally all filing fees incurred in connection with any
filing required under the HSR Act or any foreign competition filing.

12.3 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

of Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, any suit,
action, dispute, claim, controversy or other legal proceeding (whether in law,

86

the purpose of enforcing any award or judgment in a jurisdiction where the
party against which enforcement is sought has operations or owns assets) or
that any such suit, action, dispute, claim, controversy or other legal
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action, dispute, claim,
controversy or other legal proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.11_ shall be deemed effective

OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO

and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; _provided_ that no party hereto may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer (including by operation of law) any of such partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
Sellers Representative and Purchaser; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser
shall be entitled to assign, upon prior written notice to Sellers
Representative, its rights and obligations under this Agreement for

it being agreed that if Purchaser makes any such assignment, Purchaser shall
remain fully liable under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any
rights, remedies or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than the third party beneficiaries enumerated in this Agreement, including

__ _ 7.2_ (DandO Indemnification and Insurance), _Section_ __ _ 7.3_

provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived only in a writing signed
by Purchaser and Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). No waiver
of any provision hereunder or any breach or default thereof shall extend to

default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement.

 



87

    

12.6 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and the section and other
headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement and the exhibits hereto
are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
parties hereto, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement or any exhibit hereto. All references to days or months
shall be deemed references to calendar days or months, unless indicated to the
contrary. All references to "$" or "dollars" shall be deemed references to
United States dollars. Any reference in this Agreement to wire transfers or
other payments requires payment in dollars of the United States of America
unless some other currency is expressly stated in that reference. Unless the

Person.

12.8  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts

(including the Disclosure Schedule), exhibits and certificates referred to
herein, and any documents executed by the parties pursuant hereto or in

agreements and understandings, written or oral, between the parties or any of
their respective Affiliates with respect to such subject matter.

12.10 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement. Upon such determination that any provision of this Agreement
is prohibited or invalid, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may send any notice, request, demand,
claim, or other communication required or permitted hereunder to the intended
recipient at the address set forth above by personal delivery, messenger
service and/or electronic mail; provided that no such notice, request, demand,
claim, or other communication will be deemed to have been duly given unless
and until it actually is received by the intended recipient. Any party may
change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims, and other
communications required or permitted hereunder are to be delivered by giving
the other party(ies) notice in the manner herein set forth.

12.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that money damages would not
be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement. Each party shall
have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in its
favor, to enforce its rights and the obligations of the other parties
hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action
or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable
relief. Each party hereby waives any defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate in any action for specific performance and any requirement under any
law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

12.13 _Disclosure Schedule_. The disclosures in the Disclosure Schedule
concerning the Restricted Parties, the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
are to be taken as relating to the representations and warranties of the
Restricted Parties, the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole,
notwithstanding the fact that the Disclosure Schedule is arranged by sections
corresponding to the sections in this Agreement or that a particular section
of this Agreement makes reference to a specific section of the Disclosure
Schedule and notwithstanding that a particular representation and warranty
may not make a reference to the Disclosure Schedule. The inclusion of
information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as or constitute
an admission or agreement that a violation, right of termination, default,
liability or other obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item,
nor shall it be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement that such
information is material to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and/or the
Restricted Parties. In addition, matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters are set forth
for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included
or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of
the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item
or matter not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise. Further, neither the
specification of any item or matter in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such item or matter, or
other items or matters, are or are not in the Ordinary Course of Business,
and no party shall use the fact of setting forth or the inclusion of any such
items or matter in any dispute or controversy involving any of the parties
hereto as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the Ordinary Course of
Business for purposes of this Agreement.

12.14 _Legal Representation; Related Matters_. It is acknowledged by each of
the parties hereto that the Company and each Restricted Party have retained
Winston and Strawn LLP (" _W andS_"), Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP (" _Arnold_
__ _ and Porter_") and/or Stinson LLP (" _Stinson_ ") to act as its counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that WandS, Arnold and
Porter and Stinson have not acted as counsel for any other party in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the other parties
has the status of a client of WandS, Arnold and Porter or Stinson for conflict of
interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Purchaser hereby agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser,
on the one hand, and any Restricted Party and/or any of its respective post-
Closing Affiliates, on the other hand, WandS, Arnold and Porter and/or Stinson may
represent such Restricted Party or Affiliate in such dispute even though the
interests of such Restricted Party or Affiliate may be directly adverse to
Purchaser, the Company and/or any of the Companys Subsidiaries, and even
though WandS, Arnold and Porter and/or Stinson may have represented the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Purchaser further agrees that, as to all communications among
WandS, Arnold and Porter and/or Stinson and the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
any Restricted Party and/or any of their respective post-Closing Affiliates
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
to the Restricted Parties and may be controlled thereby, and shall not pass to
or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a
third party, on the other hand (other than a party to this Agreement or any
of its Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Purchaser (including on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by WandS, Arnold and Porter or Stinson to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Purchaser nor the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Sellers Representative.

12.15 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement may only be brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as
parties to this Agreement. Except to the extent named as a party to this
Agreement, and then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such
parties set forth in this Agreement, no past, present or future shareholder,
member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee (present or former),
Affiliate, financing source or agent or representative of any party to
this Agreement will have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
or other obligations or liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or
for any claim based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no claim will be brought or maintained by the Purchaser or any of
its successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director, manager,
employee (present or former), partner, financing source or Affiliate of any
party to this Agreement, or any agent or representative of any of the
foregoing, which is not otherwise expressly identified as a party to this
Agreement, and no recourse will be granted against any of them, by virtue of
or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach or
nonperformance of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of any party hereto set forth or contained in

 



93

    

 this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate
delivered hereunder, or otherwise, in relation to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

12.16 _Guarantee_. As an inducement to the Sellers to enter into this
Agreement, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the
Sellers, the prompt and full payment, performance and discharge by Purchaser
of all obligations which are or may become due by Purchaser under this
Agreement as and when payable and as and when required to be performed,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the payment of the Aggregate Purchase Price (collectively, the
" _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). Any Seller may pursue the enforcement of any
Guaranteed Obligations directly against Guarantor, without first pursuing any
remedies against Purchaser. This guarantee shall be construed as a continuing
absolute and unconditional guarantee from Guarantor of Purchasers payment and
performance under this Agreement and shall not be released, discharged or
otherwise affected by (a) any acceleration, extension, modification or renewal
in respect of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of applicable
Law or otherwise; (b) any amendment, waiver or modification of this
Agreement; (c) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Purchaser or Guarantor; (d) any other provisions of Law
expressly applicable to guarantees; (e) any defense, set-off or counterclaim
(other than a defense of payment or performance) that may at any time be
available to or be asserted by Purchaser or Guarantor against any Seller; or
(f) any other circumstances whatsoever (with or without notice to Purchaser
or Guarantor) that constitute, or might be construed to constitute, an
equitable or legal discharge of Purchaser for the Guaranteed Obligations (it
being understood that this clause is not intended to limit any contractual
defenses that Purchaser may have under this Agreement that the circumstances
underlying any such Guaranteed Obligations do not then require payment or
performance of such Guaranteed Obligation under this guarantee). Guarantors
obligations hereunder shall remain in full force and effect until all
Guaranteed Obligations shall have been performed in full.

 

12.17 _Sellers_ __ _Representative_.

 

(a) Appointment. By executing and delivering this Agreement, the Sellers
hereby irrevocably make, constitute and appoint Sellers Representative as
their agent and true and lawful attorney-in-fact for all purposes under this
Agreement, with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place
and stead of such Seller for purposes of executing any documents and taking
any actions that Sellers Representative may, in Sellers Representatives
sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate in
connection with any of Sellers Representatives duties and obligations as
contemplated in this Agreement.

(b) Authorization. Each Seller hereby authorizes Sellers Representative, on
its behalf and in its name, to:

(i) receive all notices or documents given or to be given to the Sellers by
Purchaser pursuant hereto or in connection herewith and to receive and accept
service of legal process in connection with any suit or proceeding arising
under this Agreement;

 

(ii) provide wire instructions for each Sellers portion of any consideration
paid pursuant to this Agreement;

 



94

    

(iii) deliver to Purchaser at the Closing all certificates and documents to be
delivered to Purchaser by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, together
with any other certificates and documents executed by Sellers and deposited
with Sellers Representative for such purpose;

 

(iv) engage counsel and such accountants and other advisors for Sellers and
incur such other expenses on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as Sellers Representative
may deem appropriate; and

(v) take such action on behalf of the Sellers as Sellers Representative may
deem appropriate in respect of:

(A) waiving any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered by
Purchaser pursuant hereto;

(B) waiving the fulfillment of any of the conditions precedent to Sellers
obligations hereunder;

(C) taking such other action as Sellers Representative is authorized to take
under this Agreement;

(D) receiving all documents or certificates and making all determinations, on
behalf of the Sellers, required under this Agreement;

(E) waiving, modifying or amending any provision of this Agreement;

(F) all such other matters as Sellers Representative may deem necessary or
appropriate to consummate this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and

(G) taking all such action as may be necessary after the date hereof to carry
out any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Irrevocable Appointment_. The appointment of Sellers
Representative hereunder is irrevocable and any action taken by Sellers
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section_ __ _
12.17_ shall be effective and absolutely binding on each Seller
notwithstanding any contrary action of, or direction from, any Seller.

(d) _Purchaser s Reliance_. Any approval, consent, election, notice,
decision, agreement, amendment, or other action of the Sellers required or
permitted under, or otherwise provided for in, this Agreement shall be
conclusively deemed given, made, or taken (as the case may be) if given, made,
or taken by Sellers Representative, and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely
on any notice or other document (of any kind) executed or delivered by
Sellers Representative for all such purposes.

 



95

    

(e) _Indemnification; Sellers  Representatives Expenses_.
Sellers Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by Sellers Representative as Sellers
Representative except in the case of its willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify Sellers
Representative and hold Sellers Representative harmless from and against any
debt, liability or other obligation incurred by Sellers Representative
arising out of or in connection with the administration of Sellers
Representatives duties as Sellers Representative, except to the extent such
debt, liability or other obligation is caused by Sellers Representatives
willful misconduct or gross negligence.

 

(f) _Seller Reserve Amount_. Sellers Representative shall use the Seller
Reserve Amount to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Sellers
Representative in connection with the performance of its obligations
hereunder, including costs and expenses incurred in connection with defending,
contesting, or settling any threatened dispute or claim with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder. Sellers Representative
shall have no liability to the Sellers for any loss of principal of the Seller
Reserve Amount other than as a result of Sellers Representatives gross
negligence or willful misconduct. For Tax purposes, the Seller Reserve Amount
shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Sellers at the Closing. Any amounts remaining in the Seller Reserve Amount
shall be paid by Sellers Representative to the Sellers in accordance with
the Allocation Schedule at such time as Sellers Representative determines to
be appropriate. The Sellers shall not receive interest or other earnings on
the Seller Reserve Amount. No provision of this Agreement shall require
Sellers Representative to expend or risk Seller Representatives own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any
of Sellers Representatives powers, rights, duties or privileges under this
Agreement. Furthermore, Sellers Representative shall not be required to take
any action unless Sellers Representative has been provided with funds,
security or indemnities which, in Sellers Representatives sole
determination, are sufficient to protect Sellers Representative against the
costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by Sellers
Representative in performing such actions. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall any Seller be obligated to reimburse Sellers Representative for
any costs or expenses incurred by Sellers Representative in excess of the
Seller Reserve Amount without the consent of such Seller.

 

12.18 _Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers, Sellers Representative and the Company, each on behalf of
itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its controlled Affiliates (other than
Guarantor and its Subsidiaries) hereby: (a) agrees that any Action, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Parties, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the
Financing or any of the agreements entered into in connection with the
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, New York, so long as such forum is and remains available, and any
appellate court thereof and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and
its property with respect to any such Action to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court, (b) agrees that any such Action shall be governed by the laws of
the State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of another state),
except as otherwise provided in any agreement relating to the Financing, (c)
agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to
bring or support any Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in any way arising out of or relating 

 



96

    

 to, this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough
of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of process upon
Sellers, Sellers Representative and the Company, and each of their respective
Subsidiaries or their respective controlled Affiliates in any such Action
shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _
12.11_, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively
do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action
in any such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any Action brought
against the Financing Parties in any way arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
(g) agrees that none of the Financing Parties will have any liability
to Sellers, Sellers Representative the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their respective controlled Affiliates or
Representatives (in each case, other than Guarantor, Purchaser or their
respective Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter, the Financing or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, (h) hereby
waives any and all claims and causes of action against the Financing Parties
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the
Financing or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the
performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, (i) agrees not to commence (and if
commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate, and not to assist) any
Action against any Financing Party under this Agreement, the Financing, the
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (j)
agrees that the Financing Parties are express third party beneficiaries of,
and may enforce, any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 12.18_, and
(k) agrees that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 12.18_ and the
definitions of "Financing Entities" and "Financing Parties" (and any other
provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification thereof would affect
the substance of any of the foregoing) shall not be amended in any manner
adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior written consent of the
Financing Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_
__ _ 12.18_ shall in any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of
Guarantor or Purchaser under this Agreement or any Financing Entitys
obligations to Guarantor or Purchaser under the Commitment Letter.
