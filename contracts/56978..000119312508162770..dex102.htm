Section 3.2. Escrow Amount.

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall deposit a portion of the Purchase Price equal
to fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate amount of the Upfront Consideration
as of the Closing (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow account with a
third party escrow agent to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") pursuant to the terms of an Escrow Agreement, substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Buyer
shall deposit the Escrow Amount in cash and Shares that is in the same
proportion as the proportion of cash to Buyer Common Stock in the Upfront
Consideration; provided, that, if the Wire Business Transaction is not
consummated on or before the Target Closing Date, such deposit shall be made
entirely in Buyer Common Stock. The Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow by
the Escrow Agent for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing
as security for the indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)_ herein and distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Within ten (10) calendar days after the termination of the Escrow Account,
Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the
total Tax Distributions (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) and (ii) the
fraction where the numerator is the total amount of distributions made to
Seller (or its assigns) out of the Escrow Account, and the denominator is the
sum of (A) the total amount of distributions made to Seller (or its assigns)
out of the Escrow Account and (B) the total amount of Claims (as defined in
the Escrow Agreement) paid to Buyer out of the Escrow Account.

Section 3.3. Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) Closing Working Capital Adjustment.

(i) Three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer, a written statement setting forth Sellers good faith estimate (after
consultation with Buyer) of the current assets of Seller that are included in
the Purchased Assets (which, for the sake of clarity, does not include cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities and other investments, including those
available for sale and held to maturity), less the current liabilities that
are included in the Assumed Liabilities, in each case as determined in
accordance with GAAP but subject to those GAAP exceptions set forth on
_Exhibit 3.3(a)_ (the " _Working Capital_ ") as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing
Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Working Capital Statement_ "), which
statement shall include a detailed computation of the estimated Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Date Working Capital_ ") and shall be
prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP but subject to those GAAP
exceptions set forth on _Exhibit 3.3(a)_.

(ii) If the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is:

(A) greater than $37,000,000 (the " _Target Working Capital_ "), the Upfront
Consideration shall be increased by a dollar amount equal to the difference
between the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and the Target Working
Capital, with such increase being in the form of additional cash; or



 

12 (B) less than the Target Working Capital, the Upfront Consideration shall be
decreased by a dollar amount equal to the difference between the Target
Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, with such
decrease being in the form of less cash; or

(C) equal to the Target Working Capital, the Closing Payment shall not be
adjusted in respect of the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital.

(b) Initial Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment.

(i) Not later than 60 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Working Capital Statement_ "), setting forth any proposed
adjustments to the Estimated Working Capital (the " _Closing Working Capital_
"). The Closing Working Capital Statement shall include a computation of the
Closing Working Capital.

(ii) Unless Seller, within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Working
Capital Statement, gives Buyer a notice objecting thereto and specifying
in reasonable detail the basis for such objection and the amount in dispute
(" _Notice of Objection_ "), such Closing Working Capital Statement shall be
considered accepted and binding upon Seller and Buyer. If within 30 days after
the receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, Seller gives a Notice
of Objection to Buyer, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith with a
view to resolving any differences. If such negotiations fail to resolve all
disputed items within 15 days after Notice of Objection was first given by
Seller, the remaining disputed items shall be submitted to Ernst and Young LLP
(the " _Nonpartisan Accountants_ ") for final resolution. After affording
Buyer and its representatives and Seller and its representatives the
opportunity to present their positions as to the disputed items (which
opportunity shall not extend for more than 30 days), the Nonpartisan
Accountants shall resolve all disputed items in writing. The Parties shall
instruct the Nonpartisan Accountants to limit their review and determination
to only those items in dispute and the Nonpartisan Accountants shall be
authorized to choose either Buyers or Sellers positions based solely on
such presentations or determine that the disputed items are between such
positions. Such resolution shall be final and binding upon the Parties and
shall be reflected in any necessary revisions to the Closing Working Capital
Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Nonpartisan Accountants in
connection with any such determination shall be apportioned between Seller and
Buyer based upon the inverse proportion of the disputed amounts resolved in
favor of such Party (i.e., so that the prevailing Party bears a lesser amount
of such fees, costs and expenses). Otherwise, Seller and Buyer shall each pay
its costs in connection with this _Section 3.3_, including the fees and
expenses of their respective attorneys and accountants, if any.

(iii) If the Closing Working Capital as conclusively determined as provided in
_Section 3.3(b)_ (such conclusive determination is referred to herein as "
_Certified Working Capital_ "), is:

(A) less than the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, then Seller shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer a dollar amount equal to the difference
between the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and the Certified Working
Capital, with such payment being in the form of cash; 



 

13 (B) greater than Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Seller a dollar amount equal to the difference
between the Certified Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Date Working
Capital, with such payment being in the form of cash; or

(C) equal to Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, no payment shall be
required to be made pursuant to this _Section 3.3(b)_.

Section 3.4. Allocation of Purchase Price. As promptly as practicable after
the Closing, and in any event within 30 days after the Closing, Seller shall
have prepared a schedule allocating the Purchase Price among the Purchased
Assets and the non-competition agreement contained in _Section 7.6(a)_ in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (and any similar provisions of state, local or foreign
Law, as appropriate) and deliver such schedule to Buyer. Buyer shall then have
not more than 30 days to notify Seller in writing of Buyers acceptance and
adoption of the allocation schedule for its Tax Returns or specify the nature
of any reasonable objections Buyer may have. Buyer and Seller shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any such Buyer objections to Sellers allocation
schedule. Any issues with respect to the allocation that have not been
finally resolved within 90 days following the Closing shall be referred to a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants to which Seller
and Buyer mutually agree, whose determination shall be final and binding upon
the Parties. Any costs incurred for the services of such firm shall be split
equally between Buyer and Seller. Buyer shall timely and properly prepare,
execute, file and deliver all such documents, forms and other information as
Seller may reasonably request to prepare such allocation. Unless otherwise
required under applicable Law, each Party shall report the purchase and sale
of the Purchased Assets on all Tax Returns, including timely filed
Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594, in accordance with the allocation
prepared and accepted in accordance with this _Section 3.3_, and no Party
will take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with such allocation. For purposes of clarity, an amount
included in the Tax basis of the Purchased Assets by Buyer shall not be
required to be taken into account or reported by Seller (including for
purposes of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) to the extent such amount is
not required to be treated as an amount realized by Seller for Tax purposes.

its incorporation. Each of the Seller Entities is qualified and in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties
owned, leased or operated by it, or the business conducted by it, requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Seller. Each of the Seller Entities has all requisite corporate
power and authority to conduct its business as presently conducted and to own,
lease and operate the properties and assets used in such business.

Section 5.2. Authority, Validity and Effect. Seller has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
has been, and when executed at the Closing, the Ancillary Agreements to which
it is a party will have been, duly and validly executed by Seller and,
assuming the due execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party by Buyer, will constitute legal, valid and
binding agreements of Seller, enforceable against it in accordance with their
respective terms, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally from time to time in effect, (ii)
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

(i) conflict with the charter or bylaws of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) require any consent or notice under, conflict with, result in a violation
or breach of, or constitute a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions

obligation to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
Sellers or any of its Subsidiaries properties or assets may be bound, (iii)

any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Permit, or (iv) subject to
obtaining the Seller Requisite Regulatory Approvals referred to in _Section
5.3(a)_ above, conflict with or violate any Order or Law applicable to Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of Sellers or its Subsidiaries properties
or assets.

Section 5.4. Subsidiaries. Seller has no Subsidiaries other than those listed
in _Section 5.4_ of the Disclosure Schedule, and there are no Subsidiaries of
such Subsidiaries. Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, and does not
own any shares of capital stock or other securities of any other Person. All
of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of Sellers
Subsidiaries have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.
There are no outstanding contractual obligations of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any investment in any of its Subsidiaries or any other
Person. 

Section 5.5. Leased Real Property.

(a) _Section 5.5(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a correct legal
description for the facility located at 16700 Red Hill Avenue and the street

recent property tax bill for the facility located at 16700 Red Hill Avenue

summary of the terms thereof. With respect to each of the Real Property
Leases: (i) the Real Property Lease is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and
in full force and effect; (ii) neither the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement nor any of the Ancillary Agreements shall result in a breach
of or default under the Real Property Lease or otherwise cause the Real

force and effect on identical terms following the Closing; (iii) none of the
Seller Entities nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party to any Real
Property Lease is in material breach or default under such Real Property
Lease, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with
the delivery of notice, passage of time or both,  



 

16  would constitute a material breach or default or permit the termination,
modification or acceleration of rent under such Real Property Lease; (iv)
no party to any Real Property Lease has repudiated any term thereof, and
there are no material disputes, oral agreements or forbearance programs in
effect with respect to any such Real Property Lease; and (v) no Seller Entity
has assigned, subleased, mortgaged, deeded in trust or otherwise transferred
or encumbered any Real Property Lease or any interest therein.

(b) The Seller Entities have good title to the Leasehold Improvements, which

Liens.

property used in the Business is in the possession of Seller. There are
no agreements affecting the right of Seller to convey the Purchased Assets to
Buyer or any other right of Seller with respect to the Purchased Assets, and
Seller has the absolute right, authority, power, and capacity to sell, assign,
and transfer the Purchased Assets to Buyer free and clear of any Lien. Upon
execution and delivery to Buyer of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and
Bill of Sale, Buyer will acquire good and valid title to the Purchased Assets,
free and clear of any Lien. 

(b) The Purchased Assets are in good condition and repair, reasonable wear and
tear excepted consistent with the age of the assets and properties, and are
suitable for immediate use in the Ordinary Course of Business and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, free from latent and patent defects. None of the
Purchased Assets are in need of repair or replacement other than as part of
routine maintenance in the Ordinary Course of Business. The Purchased Assets
constitute all of the rights, properties and assets necessary for Buyer to
operate the Business in the same manner operated by Seller prior to Closing.

Section 5.7. Financial Information.

(a) Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of the following
financial statements: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of Seller as

the equivalent) for the 12 month period then ended; and (ii) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of June 30, 2008 (the " _Latest
Balance Sheet_ "), and the related statements of income and cash flows
(or the equivalent) for the six month period then ended. Each of the
foregoing financial statements (the " _Financial Statements_ ") presents
fairly Sellers consolidated financial condition and results of operations as
of the times and for the periods referred to therein, and has been prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The Financial Statements reflect the consistent
application of such accounting principles throughout the periods involved,
except as disclosed in the notes to such Financial Statements. The Financial
Statements are correct and complete in all respects and are consistent with
the books and records of Seller. Seller has also delivered to Buyer copies of
all letters from Sellers auditors to Sellers board of directors or the
audit committee thereof during the thirty-six months preceding the execution
of this Agreement, together with copies of all responses thereto.

(b) Seller does not have any Liabilities, or obligations of any nature

been reflected in the Financial Statements, other than (i) those Liabilities
arising in the Ordinary Course of Business that are not material to the
Business, and (ii) those Liabilities incurred since the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet in the Ordinary Course of Business.

18 Section 5.9. Inventory. The Inventory of the Seller Entities is in good and
marketable condition, constitutes a sufficient quantity for the normal
operation of the Business in accordance with past practice, and is saleable in
the Ordinary Course of Business (other than what is reserved for obsolescence
on the Financial Statements). Adequate reserves have been reflected in the
Latest Balance Sheet for obsolete, excess, damaged, slow-moving, or otherwise
unusable Inventory, which reserves were calculated in a manner consistent with
past practice and in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. Since the
date of the Latest Balance Sheet, each of the Seller Entities has maintained
Inventory at levels consistent with its past practices in the Ordinary Course
of Business. Seller Entities are not in possession of any inventory not owned
by them, including goods already sold. The quantities of each item of
Inventories (whether raw materials, work-in-process, or finished goods) are
not excessive, but are reasonable in the present circumstances of Seller. None
of the agreements of the Seller Entities as of the date hereof (including
purchase orders) to purchase any raw materials, spare parts and other
materials and supplies are excessive. Each such agreement is reasonable in the
present circumstances of Seller and is listed on _Section 5.9_ of the
Disclosure Schedule, together with a description of each item to be purchased
and the quantity and price thereof.

Section 5.10. Accounts Receivable. All of the Accounts Receivable set forth on
_Section 5.10_ of the Disclosure Schedule represent valid obligations and
arose from sales actually made or services actually performed by Seller in
the Ordinary Course of Business. No such Accounts Receivable has been pledged
or assigned to any other Person. There is no contest, claim, defense or right
of set off with any account debtor of any Account Receivable, in excess of
the reserves taken into account in the calculation of Closing Working Capital,
relating to the amount or validity of such Account Receivable. _Section 5.10_
of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list of all
Accounts Receivable as of the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, which list
sets forth the aging of each Account Receivable.

Section 5.11. Assigned Contracts.

(a) Each of the Assigned Contracts is valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors rights; and (ii) general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). Each Seller Entity has performed all material obligations
required to be performed by it and is not in default under or in breach of nor
in receipt of any claim of default or breach under any such Assigned Contract
to which it is a party. No event has occurred which with the passage of time
or the giving of notice or both would be reasonably expected to result in a
material default, breach or event of noncompliance by a Seller Entity nor, to
the Knowledge of Seller, any other party under any Assigned Contract. No
Seller Entity has received written notice of the intention of any party to
cancel or terminate any such Assigned Contract, and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, there has not been any breach or anticipated breach by the other
parties to any such Assigned Contract.

(b) Seller has provided Buyer with a true and correct copy of all Assigned
Contracts, in each case together with all amendments, waivers, or other
changes thereto.

Section 5.12. Litigation. There are no, and during the last five years there
have not been any, claims, actions, suits, proceedings (arbitration or
otherwise), or, to the Knowledge of Seller, investigations involving
or affecting Seller, its Subsidiaries, or their respective business or
assets, or Sellers directors or officers in their capacities as such, before
or by any court or other Governmental Entity, or before an arbitrator of any
kind; and no pending claim, action, suit, proceeding, or, to the  



 

19  Knowledge of Seller, investigation, if determined adversely, could either
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or
the Purchased Assets. To the Knowledge of Seller, no such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation is presently threatened or contemplated and
there are no facts that could reasonably serve as a basis for any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding, or investigation. There are no unsatisfied
judgments, penalties, or awards against Seller or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
affecting Seller or any of its businesses, properties, or assets, including
the Purchased Assets. All claims made during the last five years under
Sellers general liability insurance or workers compensation policies are
disclosed in _Section 5.12_ of the Disclosure Schedule and all open claims
are fully described therein. To the Knowledge of Seller, there is no pending
or threatened legal proceeding that challenges, or that may have the effect of
preventing, delaying, making illegal or otherwise interfering with, any of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 5.13. Proprietary Rights.

(a) _Section 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all registered Proprietary Rights of the Seller Entities.
_Section 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule also contains a complete and
accurate list of all material licenses granted by each of the Seller Entities

any third party with respect to any such Proprietary Rights; (iii) no Seller
Entity has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise come
into conflict with any Proprietary Rights of any third parties; and (iv) no
third party has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise
come into conflict with any Proprietary Rights of the Seller Entities.

(c) All current and former employees, independent contractors and consultants
of each Seller Entity have entered into confidentiality, invention assignment
and proprietary information agreements with such Seller Entity in
substantially the form attached to _Section 5.13_ of the Disclosure Schedule.
To the Knowledge of Seller, no such employee, independent contractor or
consultant of any Seller Entity is obligated under any Contract or subject
to any Order of any court or administrative agency, or is subject to any
other restriction that would interfere with his or her duties for and to such
Seller Entity, nor has any such employee, independent contractor or consultant
failed to comply with his or her corresponding confidentiality, invention
assignment and proprietary information agreement or failed to cooperate with
Seller on the assignment of inventions to Seller pursuant to such agreement.
To the Knowledge of Seller, the carrying on of the Business by the employees,
independent contractors and consultants of the Seller Entities and the conduct
of the Business as presently conducted will not conflict with or result in a
breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default
under, any Contract under which any of such employees, independent contractors
or consultants is now obligated. To the Knowledge of Seller, at no time during
the conception of or reduction to practice of any of the Proprietary Rights
of any of the Seller Entities was any developer, inventor or other contributor
to such Proprietary Rights operating under any grants from any Governmental
Entity or private source, performing research sponsored by any  



 

20  Governmental Entity or private source or subject to any employment agreement
or invention assignment or nondisclosure agreement or other obligation with
any other third party that could materially adversely affect the rights of
such Seller Entities in such Proprietary Rights.

thereto have been paid in full. All Tax Returns and reports filed by Seller
are true, correct and complete. The unpaid Taxes of the Seller Entities (i)

liability set forth on the Latest Balance Sheet, and (ii) do not exceed that
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of each of the Seller Entities in
filing its Tax Returns. The Seller Entities have timely withheld and paid

with amounts paid or owing to any employee, creditor, independent contractor,

Seller, owns an interest in, or (in the case of individuals) serves as an
officer or director of, any Competing Business. Each Affiliate Transaction is

no notice of violation of any Environmental and Safety Laws or of any permit,
license or other authorization relating thereto has been received or
threatened against any Seller Entity in connection with the operation of the
Business, and to the Knowledge of Seller, there is no factual basis for the
giving of any such notice. No Seller Entity has received any notice or claim
to the effect that such Seller Entity is or may be liable to any Governmental
Entity or private party as a result of the release or threatened release of
any toxic or hazardous substances in connection with the conduct or operation
of the Business or the use of ownership of the Purchased Assets or
the Excluded Assets, and to Sellers Knowledge, there are no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim.
Neither the operation of the Business nor the use and ownership of the
Purchased Assets or the Excluded Assets is the subject of any federal, state

respond to a release or a threatened release of any toxic or hazardous
substances at any real property owned, leased, used or operated by a Seller
Entity in connection with the Business.

Buyer in this Agreement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or

or warranty made, in the light of the circumstances under which it was made,
not false or misleading in any material respect.

Section 6.8. Capitalization. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital
stock of Buyer consists of (i) 200,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock, of
which 53,516,309 shares are issued and outstanding, (ii) 5,000,000 shares of

from registration under the "blue sky" Laws of all jurisdictions in which such
registration or qualification is so required.

reports pursuant to Sections 13 and 15(d) thereof (all such reports filed or
required to be filed by Buyer, including all exhibits thereto or incorporated
therein by reference, and all documents filed by Buyer under the Securities
Act are hereinafter called the " _SEC Reports_ "). Buyer has filed all
reports or other documents required to be filed under the Exchange Act in the
12-month period prior to the date hereof. All SEC Reports filed by Buyer (i)
were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and (ii) did not at the time they were
filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof, then
on the date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

Section 6.10. Proprietary Rights of Third Parties. Neither Buyer nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of invalidity, infringement
or misappropriation from any third party with respect to any Proprietary
Rights of such third party, which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

Section 6.11. Environmental and Safety Laws. Except as set forth in Buyers
SEC Reports, Buyer (i) is in material compliance with all Environmental and
Safety Laws, (ii) has received all permits, licenses or other approvals
required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct its business

permit, license or approval where, in each of the three foregoing clauses, the
failure to so comply would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 6.12. Employment Matters. Buyer is in compliance with all federal,
state, local and foreign laws and regulations respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,
except where failure to be in compliance would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Buyers SEC
Reports, Buyer is not bound by or subject to (and none of its assets or
properties is bound by or subject to) any written or oral, express or implied,
contract, commitment or arrangement with any labor union, and no labor union
has requested or, to Buyers Knowledge, has sought to represent any of the
employees, representatives or agents of Buyer. There is no strike or other
labor dispute involving Buyer pending, or to Buyers Knowledge, threatened nor
is Buyer aware of any labor organization activity involving its employees. To
the actual knowledge of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer of Seller, without any duty of inquiry, as of the date hereof, neither
the Buyers Chief Executive Officer nor any of the following individuals have

Carson, TC Mak, Christian Rheault, Shawn Sarbacker, Noam Shlasky or Shay
Torton.



 

32 Section 6.13. Listing and Maintenance Requirements. Buyer is in material
compliance with each of the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing of
Buyer Common Stock listed thereon (except that the foregoing representation
shall be unqualified as to "materiality" with respect to NASDAQ Marketplace
Rule 4310(c)(16), provided that the reference to "material" in such rule
shall remain), and has not received any notification that, and has no
Knowledge that, NASDAQ is contemplating terminating such listing nor, to
Buyers Knowledge, is there any basis therefor. Assuming receipt of the Buyer
Shareholder Approval, the issuance of the Shares does not contravene the rules
and regulations of NASDAQ. Prior to the Closing, the Shares shall have been
duly authorized for listing on NASDAQ.

Section 6.14. Application of Takeover Protections. There is no control share
acquisition, business combination, poison pill (including any distribution
under a rights agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under
Buyers charter documents or the Laws of its state of incorporation that is or
could become applicable to Seller as a result of Seller, Buyer fulfilling
its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including, without limitation, as a result of Buyers
issuance of the Shares and Sellers ownership of such Shares.

Section 6.15. Buyer Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of Buyer has
received from Credit Suisse its opinion (the " _Buyer Fairness Opinion_ ") to
the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the Upfront Consideration

registration of the sale by Seller and Seller Shareholders of the shares of
Buyer Common Stock being issued to Seller pursuant to the terms of this

prior circumstance that would be reasonably likely to cause Buyer to become
ineligible to use Form S-3 as of the date hereof.

Section 7.3. Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, Seller shall afford to Buyers officers,
employees, counsel, accountants, financing sources and other authorized
representatives (collectively, the " _Buyer Representatives_ "),
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior
to the Closing Date, to its respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants and other advisors, properties, books, records, Permits and
Contracts for purposes of verifying the representations and warranties made
under this Agreement and to evaluate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, during such period, Seller shall and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to promptly furnish to such Buyer Representatives all financial,
operating and other data and information concerning the Seller Entities and
their properties, businesses and personnel as may reasonably be requested in
writing by Buyer.

(b) Buyer agrees that it will, and will cause its Buyer Representatives to,
use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ only
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and for no other reason or purpose
whatsoever.

Section 7.4. Filings Under the HSR Act and Other Antitrust Laws.

(a) _General_. The Parties acknowledge that the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements may
require filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act and
with certain foreign jurisdictions under applicable foreign competition or
merger Laws (each an " _Antitrust Law_ " and collectively, the " _Antitrust
Laws_ "). Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information,
the Parties and their respective counsel shall collaborate and consult with
each other in order to gain the necessary approval or waiver from any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
7.4_, materials provided to another Party or its counsel may be redacted (A)
to remove  



 

35  references concerning the valuation of Seller and its Subsidiaries, (B) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (C) as necessary to
address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns.

(b) _Consents; Approvals_.

(i) The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to as promptly
as practicable obtain and cooperate with each other in order to obtain
all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders and to make all
filings (including, without limitation, the filings under the HSR Act and
other Antitrust Laws and all other filings with Governmental Entities)
lawfully required to be obtained from or filed with all applicable
Governmental Entities in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Seller and Buyer and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) Each Party shall (A) file or cause to be filed with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division, and with any other Governmental Entities, if applicable,
as promptly as practicable but in no event later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, all
Notification and Report Forms and other documents required to be filed by such
Party under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) promptly comply with or cause to be
complied with any requests by any Governmental Entity for additional
information concerning such transactions, in each case so that the waiting
period applicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall expire as soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

(iii) Each Party shall furnish to the other Partys outside counsel all
information about such Party and its Affiliates, if any, required to be
included in any application or other filing to be made by such other Party
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Governmental Entity in
connection with this Agreement, subject to applicable Law and privileges,
including the attorney-client privilege.

(iv) In furtherance and not in limitation of the agreements of the Parties
contained in this _Section 7.4_, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by
a Governmental Entity or other Person with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any applicable Law.

(v) Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of the applicable HSR Act filing fees
and all other antitrust notification filing fees required in any other
applicable jurisdiction.

(c) _Divestitures; Obligation to Close_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall be
deemed to require Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries to,
and Seller and its Subsidiaries will not without Buyers prior written
consent, agree to any divestiture of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise
control of such assets, properties and stock, in each case, to avoid or
eliminate any impediment under Antitrust Laws. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein in the event that any Governmental Entity requests
additional information that could reasonably be expected to cause a delay in
the consummation of the transactions beyond the date set forth in _Section
9.1(b)_, or requires the divestiture of shares of capital stock or of any
business, assets or property, or the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of any of them to conduct their businesses.



 

36 Section 7.5. Exclusivity. Until this Agreement is terminated by its terms,
Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, solicit,
initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person
relating to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the capital stock
or assets of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, whether such transaction
takes the form of a sale of stock, merger, liquidation, dissolution,
reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise
(an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "). The Seller Entities and their agents and
other Persons acting on their behalf (a) do not have any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (except
this Agreement), (b) shall cease and cause to be terminated any and all
discussions with any Person (other than Buyer) regarding any Acquisition
Proposal and shall not provide any information to, or otherwise cooperate
with, any such Person, and (c) shall promptly notify Buyer if any Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry or contact with any Person or entity with respect
thereto, is made.

Section 7.6. Noncompetition, Nonsolicitation, and Confidentiality.

(a) _Noncompetition_. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Named Individuals
and Seller will not, and Seller will cause its current and future Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly, whether by itself or through an agent,
employee or otherwise, or in association with any Person, (i) engage in any
business throughout the world that commercially designs, manufactures, sells
or markets products, that compete, in whole or in part, with the Business (a "
_Competing Business_ "), or (ii) own, invest in the stock, bonds or other
securities of, finance, manage, operate, control, participate in the
ownership, management, operation, or control of, any other Person that is
engaged in a Competing Business; _provided_ , _however_ , neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates will be in violation of this _Section 7.6(a)_
solely by reason of investing in stock, bonds or other securities of any
Person or entity engaged in a Competing Business if: (i) such stock, bonds or
other securities are listed on any national securities exchange or have been
registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act or any successor law; and
(ii) such investment does not exceed, in the case of any class of the capital
stock of any one issuer, 1% of the issued and outstanding shares or such
capital stock, or, in the case of bonds or other securities, 1% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof issued and outstanding. The Parties hereto
agree that the covenant set forth in this _Section 7.6(a)_ is reasonable
with respect to its duration, geographical area, and scope. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this _Section 7.6(a)_ is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties
agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area
of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace
any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that
is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

(b) _Nonsolicitation_. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Named
Individuals and Seller will not, and Seller will cause its current and future
Affiliates not to, (i) directly or indirectly contact, approach, or solicit
for the purpose of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee,
consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise) or actually hire any
Person employed by a Seller Entity at any time before the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, and (ii) induce or  



 

37  attempt to induce any customer, vendor or other business relation of any
Seller Entity (A) to enter into any business relationship which
might materially harm Buyer or (B) to refrain from doing business with Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) _Confidentiality_. Each of the Named Individuals and Seller shall, and in
the case of Seller shall cause its current and future Affiliates to, treat and
hold as confidential any information concerning the Business of Seller
Entities (including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights) that is not
already generally available to the public (the " _Confidential Information_
"), refrain from using any of the Confidential Information except in
connection with this Agreement, and at any time upon the request of Buyer,
deliver promptly to Buyer or destroy, at the request and option of Buyer, all
copies of the Confidential Information which are in its possession or under
its control. In the event that any Named Individual, Seller, or any of
its Affiliates, is requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential
Information, Seller shall notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement
so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 7.6(c)_. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, a Named Individual,
Seller or any of its Affiliates is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information to any Governmental Entity or else stand
liable for contempt, such Named Individual, Seller or its Affiliate may
disclose the Confidential Information to such Governmental Entity; _provided_
that the Named Individual or Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request
and expense of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information required to
be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.

(d) _Remedy for Breach_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a
breach of any of the provisions of this _Section 7.6_, monetary damages
shall not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event of any
such breach, Buyer, or its successors or assigns may, in addition to other
rights and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance or injunctive or
other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions
hereof, in each case without the requirement of posting a bond or proving
actual damages.

Section 7.7. Employee Matters.

(a) _Employment_. Buyer shall make offers of employment, to be effective as of
the Closing Date, to those employees of Seller listed on _Schedule 7.7_ (those
employees who accept employment with Buyer are collectively referred
to herein as the " _Transferred Employees_ "). Buyer shall provide each
Transferred Employee with terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those applicable to such Transferred
Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, including providing
for substantially equivalent places of employment, compensation, and
responsibilities. Buyer shall also offer Transferred Employees employee
benefits pursuant to its Buyer employee benefit plans, programs or
arrangements (including equity participation opportunities, severance,
retirement and welfare) (each, a " _Buyer Plan_ ") that are substantially
similar to the benefits provided by Buyer to its own similarly
situated employees. Buyer shall credit each Transferred Employee with service
for all periods of service prior to the Closing Date recognized by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and
benefit levels, as the case may be, under all Buyer Plans for which they are
eligible following the Closing Date to the same extent recognized under
comparable Seller Plans  



 

38  prior to the Closing Date, provided, however, that this language shall not
be construed as giving past service credit for awards that require future
service as a condition of earning any bonus, incentive or equity awards
granted on or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any
Transferred Employee the right to continue in employment following the
Closing Date, or is intended to interfere with Buyers right to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee for any reason or no reason from or
following the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall waive
any covenants not to compete, confidentiality provisions or other similar
restrictions that may be applicable to Transferred Employees but only to the
extent such covenants, provisions or restrictions relate to the Business and
would prohibit the Transferred Employees from accepting employment with Buyer
or one of its Affiliates or continuing in such employment at all without
violating any such covenants, provisions or restrictions; provided, however,
Seller shall not waive any confidentiality provisions or other similar
restrictions to the extent applicable to the Excluded Assets or Excluded
Liabilities, simply as a result of a Transferred Employee becoming an employee
of Buyer or one of its Affiliates.

(b) _COBRA_. Buyer shall have sole responsibility for "continuation coverage"
benefits provided after the Closing Date under Buyers group health plans to
all Transferred Employees, and "qualified beneficiaries" of Transferred
Employees, for whom a "qualifying event" occurs after the Closing Date. Seller
shall have the sole responsibility for "continuation coverage" benefits
provided under Sellers group health plans to all Transferred Employees, and
all "qualified beneficiaries" of such Transferred Employees, for whom a
"qualifying event" has occurred on or prior to the Closing Date, or for any
Seller employee or "qualified beneficiary" who is not a Transferred Employee
or a "qualified beneficiary" of a Transferred Employee, regardless of when
such "qualifying event" occurs, and the obligations of Seller under this
sentence are Retained Liabilities. The terms "continuation coverage,"
"qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying event" shall have the
meaning ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-608
of ERISA.

(c) _Employee Benefit Plans_. Seller shall retain all sponsorship,
obligations, responsibilities and Liabilities with respect to any Seller Plan
(as defined in _Section 5.18_). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, no Seller Plan shall be transferred to or assumed
by Buyer.

(d) _WARN Act Filings_. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees to cooperate in the
preparation of any notices required to be made under the WARN Act and any
similar applicable Law as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e)  _Transition_. Seller shall provide any transition services necessary to
transfer the employment of the Transferred Employees and to cooperate with
Buyer in order to effect a smooth transition for all Transferred Employees.

Section 7.8. Certain Tax Matters.

(a) Seller will be responsible for preparing and filing property (whether real
or personal) and similar Tax Returns (" _Property Tax Returns_ ") with respect
to the Purchased Assets for tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date
and subject to proration of such taxes as described below, will make all
payments required with respect to each such Tax Return. Buyer will be
responsible for preparing and filing all Property Tax Returns for the
Purchased Assets for all periods commencing after the Closing Date and
subject to proration of such taxes as described below, will  



 

39  make all payments required with respect to each such Tax Return. Such ad
valorem and property (whether real or personal) Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), shall be prorated
between Buyer and Seller by prorating the Taxes owed for the Straddle Period
on a per-diem basis (by assuming Seller held such assets through the Closing
Date). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by a party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to
this Agreement and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon a partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder, and timely notification of
receipt of any notice of an audit or notice of deficiency relating to any Tax
or Tax Return with respect to which the non-recipient may have liability
hereunder.

(b) Buyer and Seller shall each pay 50% of all sales or use Taxes, recording,
registration and conveyance Taxes and fees, and similar transfer Taxes arising
from or relating to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (the "
_Transaction Taxes_ "). Seller shall file or cause to be filed all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transaction Taxes. If
required by applicable law, Buyer shall join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns or such other related documentation.

(c) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver within 60
days of the Closing all Tax clearance certificates or tax status letters, as
applicable, necessary for Buyer to avoid any potential successor liability for
the taxes of any of the Seller Entities.

Section 7.9. Notification of Certain Matters. The Parties shall promptly
advise each other orally and in writing of (a) any representation or warranty
made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, (b) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement or (c) any change or event (i) having,
or which, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, would have, a Material
Adverse Effect on Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or (ii) which has
resulted, or which, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, would result, in
any of the conditions set forth in Article VIII not being satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

Section 7.10. Meeting of Buyer Shareholders. If required under Buyers Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, applicable Laws or the rules
of NASDAQ, Buyer shall, promptly after the date hereof, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Buyer Shareholder Approval in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Buyers Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws, applicable Law, the rules of NASDAQ, and this
Agreement, at a duly called and noticed meeting of the Buyer Shareholders (the
" _Buyer Shareholders  Meeting_").

Section 7.11. Preparation of Registration Statement.

(a) If the Wire Business Transaction is not consummated on or before the
Target Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare a registration statement on Form S-4
(such registration statement, together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, being the " _S-4 Registration Statement_ "), with the
assistance of Seller, in connection with the registration under the Securities
Act  



 

40  of the offering, sale and delivery of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in as
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such filing with the SEC
pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act promptly after
the Target Closing Date and after receipt of the Seller SEC Financial
Statements from Accountant, but in no event later than 10 Business Days
following such receipt; _provided, however_ , that neither party shall be
compelled by such undertaking to make any concession to any Governmental
Entity that it in good faith regards as inappropriate. Buyer and Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement
become effective as promptly as practicable, and shall take any action
required to be taken under any applicable federal or state securities Laws
in connection with the issuance of the Alternative Upfront Consideration.
Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of
any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of the S-4 Registration
Statement and, if such an order is issued, will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the earliest
possible time.

(b) If the Alternative Upfront Consideration is not issued at the Closing,
Buyer shall prepare and file promptly with the SEC after the Closing Date and
the receipt of the Seller SEC Financial Statements a registration statement on
Form S-3 under the Securities Act (the " _S-3 Registration Statement_ " and,
together with the S-4 Registration Statement, the " _Registration Statement_
") for the resale by the Seller and the Seller Shareholders of the Shares,
provided that, notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained
herein, Buyer shall file the S-3 Registration Statement no later than the
tenth Business Day following the filing of the Buyer Form 8-K, or amendment
thereto, with the SEC pursuant to Section 7.18 below, which includes the SEC
Financial Statements. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to have the S-3 Registration Statement become effective as promptly as
practicable, and shall take any action required to be taken under any
applicable federal or state securities Laws in connection with the issuance of
the Shares. Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of the S-3
Registration Statement and, if such an order is issued, will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the
earliest possible time. Buyer will file all reports required to be filed by
Buyer with the SEC in a timely manner so as to preserve its eligibility for
the use of Form S-3, and Buyer shall cause the S-3 Registration Statement to
remain effective until the earlier of such date that Seller and each of the
Seller Shareholders are eligible to sell the Shares pursuant to Rule 144
under the Securities Act without limitation as to volume or such date that all
of the Shares have been sold.

(c) The information supplied by each Party for inclusion in the Registration
Statement shall not, at the time the Registration Statement is declared
effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading. If, at any time prior to the date on
which the Registration Statement becomes effective, any event or circumstance
relating to a Party or any of its Affiliates, or to their respective officers
or directors, should be discovered by such Party that should be set forth in
an amendment to the Registration Statement, such Party shall promptly inform
the other and prepare and assist Buyer in the filing of such amendment,
subject to Section 7.12(d) below. All documents that Buyer is responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
shall comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

(d) Buyer shall permit Seller and Sellers counsel to review the Registration
Statement and all amendments and supplements thereto a reasonable amount of
time prior to their filing with the SEC, and will not file any of the
foregoing without the approval of Seller, which  



 

41  approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer shall advise
Seller promptly upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i)
effectiveness of the Registration Statement; (ii) the filing of an amendment
to the Registration Statement; (iii) the issuance of any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement; (iv) the suspension of the
qualification of Buyer Common Stock issuable in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein for offering or sale in any jurisdiction; (v)
any request by the staff of the SEC for an amendment of the Registration
Statement; and (vi) the receipt of comments from the staff of the SEC on the
Registration Statement or any amendment thereto or any request by the staff of
the SEC for additional information with respect to any of the foregoing. Buyer
shall promptly provide to Seller copies of all correspondence between Buyer
or any of its representatives and advisors, on the one hand, and the SEC, on
the other hand, in connection with the Registration Statement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Buyer shall bear the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
filings and registrations contemplated by this _Section 7.11_; provided,

the Accountant, as the case may be, of Sellers SEC Financial Statements or
relating to the foregoing parties review of the Registration Statement or any
amendments thereto.

Section 7.12. NASDAQ. Buyer shall file a Notification Form: Listing of
Additional Shares (the " _NASDAQ Notification Form_ ") with respect to the

efforts to cause Accountant to (a) deliver to the Buyer audited financial
statements (income statements, balance sheet, statements of shareholder equity
and cash flow statements) audited by Accountant in compliance with GAAP and
the rules and regulations of the SEC, for the annual periods ending December
31, 2006 and December 31, 2007, and unaudited financial statements (income
statements, balance sheet, statements of shareholder equity and cash
flow statements) reviewed by Accountant in compliance with GAAP and the rules
and regulations of the SEC, for the interim periods required to be included in
the Registration Statement (collectively, the "Seller SEC
Financial Statements"), in each case within thirty (30) days after the date
of this Agreement; provided, that with respect to the Seller SEC Financial
Statements for the period ending September 30, 2008 (to the extent that the
Parties determined that such SEC Financial Statements are required for
inclusion in the Buyer Form 8-K), the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Accountant to deliver such SEC Financial Statements to Buyer
within twenty (20) days from the date that the Parties determine that such
Financial Statements are required (it being understood, however, that such SEC
Financial Statements can not be delivered prior to October 20, 2008), and (b)
grant any consents required under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
each as amended, in connection with the filing by Buyer of reports or
financial statements of the Seller audited by Accountant with the SEC.

Section 7.14. Further Assurances. Each of the Parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all appropriate
action and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary or
appropriate to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by

instruments or conveyances of any kind (not containing additional
representations and warranties) which may be necessary or appropriate to carry
out any of the provisions hereof.

Section 7.15. Publicity. Before the Closing Date, the Parties will consult
with each other and will mutually agree upon any press releases pertaining to
the transactions contemplated by this  



 

42  Agreement and shall not issue any such press releases prior to such
consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law, in
which case the Party proposing to issue such press release shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other Party
before issuing any such press release.

Section 7.16. Name Change. By the close of business on the third Business Day
following the Closing Date, Seller shall file with the California Secretary
of State an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation effecting a change in
the name of Seller to a name that does not include "Orthodyne."

until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall invite one Named
Individual (the " _Observer_ ") to attend in a non-voting observer capacity
all meetings of Buyers board of directors and Buyer shall give the Observer
copies of all notices, minutes, consents, and other material that it provides
to its board members; provided, however, that Buyer reserves the right to
exclude the Observer from access to any material or meeting or portion thereof
if (a) Buyer believes that such exclusion is reasonably necessary to preserve
the attorney-client privilege, to protect confidential information or (b) such
meeting or portion of a meeting is an executive session limited solely to
members of the board and legal counsel; provided, further, that the rights
granted pursuant to _Section 7.17_ shall terminate prior to the third
anniversary of the Closing Date in the event that no Named Individual is
employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates. The Observer initially will be
Gregg S. Kelly. If Mr. Kellys employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, he will be
replaced as Observer by the Named Individual who assumes Mr. Kellys role as
senior officer responsible for the wedge bonding business unit of Buyer, or
if no Named Individual assumes such role, by a Named Individual to be
determined by the Named Individuals.

Section 7.18. Securities Laws Disclosure. Buyer shall file a Current Report on
Form 8-K disclosing the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with SEC rules and regulations (the "Buyer Form
8-K"). To the extent that the Seller SEC Financial Statements are available,
the Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to include the Seller
SEC Financial Statements and any pro forma financial information required by
such rules and regulations in the initial Buyer Form 8-K; provided, that, if
the Buyer Form 8-K does not include such statements and information, then
Buyer shall file an amendment to the Buyer Form 8-K in accordance with SEC
rules and regulations including such statements and information as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter. In addition, Buyer shall make such other
filings and notices in the manner and time required by the Commission
and NASDAQ, as applicable.

47 ARTICLE X

INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS

Section 10.1. Survival. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
10.2(b)(iii)_ or _Section 10.2(c)_, the representations and warranties of the
Parties made in Articles V and VI, respectively, and the respective covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, shall survive the Closing Date
and shall expire on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date
(provided that such expiration shall be tolled with respect to any Claim made
prior to the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date until the
final and nonappealable resolution of such Claim) (the " _Survival Limitation_
").

Section 10.2. Sellers Agreements to Indemnify.

(a) _General Indemnification_. Subject to the other provisions of this 
_Section 10.2_, Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, any parent corporation,
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ "), from
and against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred by a Buyer
Indemnified Party which may be imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by
or assessed against such Buyer Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, as a
result of or relating to or to the extent arising out of any of the
following:

(i) Any breach (and any claim that, if true, would constitute such a breach)
of any representation or warranty by Seller contained in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto;

(ii) Any breach by Seller of, or any failure by Seller to perform or comply
with any of their covenants or other obligations contained in this Agreement;
or

(iii) Any Retained Liabilities.

(b) _Limitations on Seller s General Indemnification Obligations_. Except as
otherwise provided in _Section 10.2(b)(iii)_, if any Buyer Indemnified Party
becomes potentially entitled to any indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ of this Agreement, the amount that such Buyer Indemnified Person
is entitled to recover in connection therewith shall nevertheless be limited
as follows:

(i) No Losses shall be payable in respect of a claim under  _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ until the total of all such Losses exceeds the Indemnification
Threshold, in which case Seller shall be responsible for all such Losses;

(ii) The sole and exclusive remedy for money damages and source of payment for
any Losses in respect of a claim under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ shall be the
funds held in the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; and

(iii) Sellers maximum liability to Buyer in respect of all Losses indemnified
under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ shall be the Indemnification Cap; provided,
however, that Buyers remedy for money damages shall not be limited to the
funds held in the Escrow Account and the Indemnification Threshold, the
Indemnification Cap and the Survival Limitation shall not apply to any of the
following:

a. in cases of fraud;

  

 

48 b. representations or warranties that Seller knew were inaccurate and
intentionally breached when made; 

c. representations set forth in _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.4_ , _5.6_ ,
_5.15_ , _5.18_ and _5.21_ with respect to due authority to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, ownership of the Purchased
Assets, brokers or finders fees and employee benefit plans, respectively;

d. suits by the Seller Shareholders or by any participant in the Orthodyne

e. liabilities of Seller or any of the Seller Entities with respect to income
of Seller for Taxes that are due or accrue on or before the Closing.

(c) _Environmental Indemnification_. Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and each Buyer Indemnified Party, from and against and in
respect of any and all Losses and Liabilities arising under the Environmental
and Safety Laws to the extent related to the operation of the Business and/or
the use and ownership of the Purchased Assets and the Excluded Assets prior
to the Closing Date.

Section 10.3. Buyers Agreement to Indemnify.

(a) _Indemnification_. Subject to the other provisions of this _Section
10.3_, Buyer hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its directors, officers, employees, agents, any parent corporation,
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against and in respect of any and all Losses incurred by a Seller
Indemnified Party which may be imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by
or assessed against such Seller Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, as
a result of or relating to or to the extent arising out of either of the
following:

(i) any breach (and any claim that, if true, would constitute such a breach)
of any representation or warranty by Buyer contained in this Agreement; or 

(ii) any breach by Buyer of, or any failure by Buyer to perform or comply
with, any of its covenants or other obligations contained in this Agreement;
or

(iii) any Assumed Liabilities.

(b) _Limitations on Buyer s Indemnification Obligations_. No Losses shall be
payable in respect of a claim under _Section 10.3(a)(i)_ until the total of
all such Losses exceeds the Indemnification Threshold (the " _Buyer
Threshold_ "). The aggregate amount of all payments made by Buyer in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.3(a)(i)_
shall not exceed the Cap. For the sake of clarity, the foregoing limitations
do not apply to Buyers obligation to pay the Purchase Price.



 

49 Section 10.4. Procedures.

(a) _Notice of Claim_. If a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified
Party (collectively, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall become aware of any
claim, proceeding or other matter (a " _Claim_ ") which may give rise to a
Loss, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the other
party from whom it seeks indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "). Such
notice shall specify whether the Claim is asserted by a Person who is not a
party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or whether the Claim is
asserted by a party to this Agreement (a " _Direct Claim_ "), and shall also
specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent that the information is
available) the factual basis for the Claim and the amount of the Claim, if
known. If, through the fault of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
does not receive notice of any Claim in time to contest effectively the
determination of any Loss susceptible of being contested, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to set off against the amount claimed by the
Indemnified Party the amount of any Losses incurred by the Indemnifying Party
resulting from the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice on a timely
basis.

(b) _Direct Claims_. With respect to any Direct Claim, following receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
have 45 days to make such investigation of the Claim as is considered
necessary or desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party the information relied
upon by the Indemnified Party to substantiate the Claim, together with all
such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. If
both parties agree at or prior to the expiration of such 45-day period (or any
mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of such
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay to the Indemnified Party
the full agreed upon amount of the Claim, subject to the limitations hereof.
If the Indemnifying Person notifies the Indemnified Person in writing that it
disputes such claim for indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of
the Indemnified Person to indemnification under this Article X with respect
thereto but disputes the amount of the Losses in connection therewith, or if
the Indemnifying Person fails to notify the Indemnified Person within such
45-day period that it either admits or disputes such claim for
indemnification, then in either of such cases the indemnification Claim
described in the notice shall be a disputed indemnification claim that must
be resolved by arbitration.

(c) _Third Party Claims_.

(i) With respect to any Third Party Claims other than claims with respect to
Taxes, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its expense and at its
election, to assume control of the negotiation, settlement and defense of the
Claim through counsel of its choice. In such event, the Indemnifying Party
shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all the Indemnified Partys
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys fees) as a result of such assumption. The election of the
Indemnifying Party to assume such control shall be made within 30 days of
receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, failing which the Indemnifying
Party shall be deemed to have elected not to do so. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume such control, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
be informed and consulted with respect to the negotiation, settlement or
defenses of such Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf,
but the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party consents to the retention of
such counsel or unless the named parties to any action or proceeding include
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and a representation of
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel
would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests
between them (such as the availability of different defenses). If the
Indemnifying Party, having elected to assume such control, thereafter fails to
defend the Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Indemnified Party
shall  



 

50  be entitled to assume such control, and the Indemnifying Party shall be
bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Third Party Claim. If any Third Party Claim is of a nature such that the
Indemnified Party is required by applicable Law to make a payment to any
Person (a " _Third Party_ ") with respect to the Third Party Claim before the
completion of settlement negotiations or related legal proceedings, the
Indemnified Party may make such payment and the Indemnifying Party shall
forthwith, after demand by the Indemnified Party, reimburse the Indemnified
Party for such payment. If the amount of any liability of the Indemnified
Party under the Third Party Claim in respect of which such payment was made,
as finally determined, is less than the amount which was paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified party shall,
promptly after receipt of the difference from the Third Party, pay the amount
of such difference to the Indemnifying Party.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to
consent, settle or pay the amount claimed. Whether or not the Indemnifying
Party assumes control of the negotiation, settlement or defenses of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except in cases where such Third Party
Claim relates solely to money damages to be paid by the Indemnifying Party and
includes a full release of all Liabilities in respect of such Third Party
Claim in favor of the Indemnifying Party.

(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate fully
with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, and, regardless of which
party has control thereof as provided for herein, shall keep each other fully
advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant
documentation promptly as it becomes available).

Section 10.5. Adjustments. In calculating any amount of Losses recoverable
pursuant to this Article X, the amount of such Losses shall be reduced by (i)
any insurance proceeds actually received relating to such Loss, net of any
related deductible and any expenses to obtain such proceeds, (ii) any
recoveries from third parties pursuant to indemnification (or otherwise)
with respect thereto, net of any expenses incurred by the party seeking
indemnification in obtaining such third party payment and (iii) the amount of
any reduction of the Indemnified Persons Tax Liability with respect to any
period or portion thereof following the Closing Date. If any of clauses
(i)-(iii) is realized after the Indemnifying Party has already made any
payments pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such benefit received pursuant to clauses
(i)-(iii), as applicable, no later than fifteen days after the benefit is
realized.

Section 10.6. Sole Remedy. After the Closing, and except for any non-monetary,
equitable relief to which any Indemnified Party may be entitled, the rights
and remedies set forth in this Article X shall constitute the sole
and exclusive rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party under or with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. The Parties agree that
nothing contained herein shall limit any Partys rights against another Party
hereto for fraud under applicable Laws in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 10.7. Tax Treatment. Amounts paid to or on behalf of Seller as
indemnification shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.



 

51 Section 10.8. Setoff. Upon notice to Seller specifying in reasonable detail
the basis therefor, Buyer shall, prior to seeking any amounts directly from
Seller, setoff amounts otherwise currently payable by it under this Agreement
against any amount to which it may be entitled under _Sections 10.2(a)(ii)_ ,
_10.2(a)(iii)_ and  _10.2(b)(iii)_. Neither the exercise of nor the failure
to exercise such right of setoff or to give a notice of a claim under this
Agreement will constitute an election of remedies or limit Buyer in any manner
in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.
