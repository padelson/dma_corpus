Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to ATN, pursuant to an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") hereunder. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of ATN Common Units and which shall be used to make all deliveries of shares of Parent Common Stock as required by and pursuant to this _Article III_. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_. Any cash

  and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including
as payment for any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.2(d)_ ) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions delivered by
Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for ATN Common Units pursuant to this Agreement,
through the Merger, out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in customary form and agreed to by Parent and ATN prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the ATN Common Units represented by such Certificates. Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) at Parents election either (i) certificate(s) evidencing shares of Parent Common Stock or (ii) evidence of shares in book-entry form representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article III_ (after taking into account all ATN Common Units then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of ATN Common Units that is not registered in the transfer records of ATN, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such ATN Common Units may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such ATN Common Units is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration without interest payable in respect of the ATN Common Units represented by such Certificate and any distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 

 (c) _No Further Rights in ATN Common Units_. The Merger Consideration delivered or issued, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ or _Section 3.3_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such ATN Common Units.

  (d) _Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or scrip of the shares of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of the same (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in the Merger, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of ATN Common Units (including ATN Restricted Units) exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest and rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to the product of (i) the closing sale price of the shares of Parent Common Stock on NASDAQ as reported by The Wall Street Journal on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur and (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and it shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. No dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a shareholder of Parent.

 

 (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund with Respect to Merger_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund constituting shares of Parent Common Stock that remains undistributed to the holders of ATN Common Units in the Merger after 180 days following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of ATN Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in the Merger in respect of such ATN Common Units, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_ , without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of ATN Common Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent or ATN, as the case may be, free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, ATN or the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of ATN Common Units for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by ATN or Parent, the posting

  by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as ATN or Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the ATN Common Units represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate and any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

 

 (h) _Withholding_. Each of ATN, Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of ATN Common Units such amounts as ATN, Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of ATN Common Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by ATN, Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

 Section 3.3 _Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers._ From and after the Effective Time, holders of ATN Common Units shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, members of ATN, and shall have no rights in respect of ATN Common Units, other than the right to receive (a) any dividend or other distribution with respect to such ATN Common Units with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by ATN on such ATN Common Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and (b) the consideration provided under this _Article III_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the unit transfer books of the ATN Common Units.

 

 Section 3.4 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event of any subdivisions, reclassifications, recapitalizations, splits, combinations or dividends in the form of equity interests with respect to the Parent Common Stock or the ATN Common Units, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger, the average closing sales prices of the shares of Parent Common Stock determined in accordance with _Section 3.2(d)_ and the Exchange Ratio will be correspondingly adjusted.

 

 Section 3.5 _Options, Phantom Units and Restricted Units._

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, Parent will assume each outstanding ATN Unit Option, and such ATN Unit Option will become an option (i) to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (calculated on an aggregate basis and rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock) obtained by multiplying the number of ATN Common Units issuable upon the exercise of such ATN Unit Option by the Exchange Ratio, (ii) at an exercise price per share (calculated on an aggregate basis and rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the per share exercise price of such ATN Unit Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, and (iii) otherwise upon the same terms and conditions as such outstanding ATN Unit Options; provided, however, that the exercise price and the

  number of shares purchasable pursuant to such ATN Unit Option and the terms
and conditions of exercise of such ATN Unit Option will not be treated by
Parent or ATN as the grant of a new stock right or a change in the form of
payment within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

 (b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding grant of ATN Phantom Units shall be assumed by Parent and converted into a grant of phantom units denominated in that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of ATN Common Units to which such grant of ATN Phantom Units was subject at the time of such assumption multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. At the Effective Time, all outstanding ATN Restricted Units heretofore granted shall be converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , at the Exchange Ratio, into Parent Restricted Stock. Any fractional share of Parent Restricted Stock, and any fractional Parent phantom unit, shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share of Parent Common Stock. Each share of Parent Common Stock and each Parent phantom unit in respect of which an ATN Restricted Unit or ATN Phantom Unit, respectively, was so assumed and converted shall be subject to, and shall vest upon, the terms and conditions that are the same as those of the applicable ATN Restricted Unit or ATN Phantom Unit. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will provide each holder of ATN Restricted Units and ATN Phantom Units with a notice describing the assumption and conversion of such awards.

 

 (c) With the exception of those Persons who hold ATN Unit Options, ATN Restricted Units and ATN Phantom Units, no Person shall have any right under any plan, program, agreement or arrangement with respect to ATN Common Units, or for the issuance or grant of any right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive benefits or compensation measured by the value of a number of ATN Common Units at and after the Effective Time.

 

 (d) Parent will take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Parent Stock Options, and vesting of Parent phantom units, in respect of the ATN Unit Options and ATN Phantom Units that Parent assumes under _Sections 3.6(a)_ and _3.6(b)_.

 

 (e) On or prior to the 30th day following the Effective Time, Parent will file (or will have filed) a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to ATN Unit Options and will use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for as long as such options remain outstanding.

 

 (f) Parent will either, at its option, (i) provide for the grant of assumed and converted equity compensation awards described above in this _Section 3.6_ under equity compensation plans of Parent, or (ii) assume, as of the Effective Time, the ATN Long-Term Incentive Plan, and provide for the grant or continuation of such awards thereunder. Upon assumption of such plans, such amendments thereto as may be required to reflect the Merger and the requirements of _Section 3.6(a)_ will be deemed to have been made.

  ARTICLE IV

 ATN hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as otherwise set forth (i) in ATNs Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement (the " _ATN Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section of the ATN Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section of this _Article IV_ to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) in the ATN SEC Reports (excluding any forward-looking statements included therein or any statements of a cautionary nature that are not historical facts in any risk factor section of such documents) filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement:

 

 Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification._ ATN is a limited liability company duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. ATN has the requisite limited liability power and authority to own or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character of the properties owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have an ATN Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). When used in connection with ATN or any of its Subsidiaries, the term " _ATN Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any state of facts, circumstance, change or effect that is materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of ATN and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except that none of the following (or the effects thereof) will be deemed to constitute, and none of the following will be taken into account in determining whether there has been or if there is reasonably likely to be, an ATN Material Adverse Effect: (i) general economic conditions, changes in securities markets (including any disruption thereof), regulatory or political conditions, including any engagement in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack or a general economic recession, natural disasters or other force majeure events, in each case in the United States or elsewhere, except to the extent that such conditions, changes or events affect ATN in a materially disproportionate and adverse manner when compared to companies of similar size operating in the same industry or market as ATN; (ii) changes in or events or conditions generally affecting the oil and gas exploration and development industry (including changes in commodity prices and general market prices), except to the extent that such conditions, changes or events affect ATN in a materially disproportionate and adverse manner when compared to companies of similar size operating in the same industry or market as ATN; (iii) changes in Laws or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or interpretations thereof, except to the extent that such changes affect ATN in a materially disproportionate and adverse manner when compared to companies of similar size operating in the same industry or market as ATN; (iv) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, any actions taken in compliance with this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; (v) any failure by ATN to meet estimates of revenues or earnings for any period ending after the date of this Agreement (provided that the underlying causes of any such failure may be considered in determining whether an ATN Material Adverse Effect has occurred); (vi) the downgrade in rating of any debt securities of ATN by Standard and Poors Rating Group, Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Fitch Ratings

  (provided that the underlying causes of any such downgrade may be considered
in determining whether an ATN Material Adverse Effect has occurred); (vii) the
taking of any action (or omitting to take any action) required or contemplated
by this Agreement or the taking of any action (or omitting to take any action)
that Parent, in its capacity as a party to this Agreement and not in any other
capacity with respect to ATN or Atlas Energy Management, has requested or to
which Parent has consented; or (viii) changes in the price or trading volume
of the ATN Common Units (provided that the underlying causes of any such

Other than with respect to ATNs Subsidiaries, ATN does not directly or indirectly own any equity interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business entity, other than equity interests held for investment that are not, in the aggregate, material to ATN. All of ATNs equity interests in its Subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly owned, are held free and clear of any Lien (other than in favor of ATN or any of its Subsidiaries), no equity interests of any of ATNs Subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued by reason of any Rights, there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any of ATNs Subsidiaries is or may be bound to sell or otherwise transfer any equity interests of any such Subsidiaries, there are no contracts, commitments, understandings, or arrangements relating to ATNs rights to vote or to dispose of such equity interests, and all of the equity interests of each such Subsidiary held by ATN or its Subsidiaries are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by ATN or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens.

When used in connection with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any state of facts, circumstance, change or effect that is materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including ATN and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, except that none of the following (or the effects thereof) will be deemed to constitute, and none of the following will be taken into account in determining whether there has been or if there is reasonably likely to be, a Parent Material Adverse Effect: (i) general economic conditions, changes in securities markets (including any disruption thereof), regulatory or political conditions, including any engagement in hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack or a general economic recession, natural disasters or other force majeure events, in each case in the United States or elsewhere, except to the extent that such conditions, changes or events affect Parent in a materially disproportionate and adverse manner when compared to companies of similar size operating in the same industry or market as Parent; (ii) changes in or events or conditions generally affecting the oil and gas exploration and development industry (including changes in commodity prices and general market prices), except to the extent that such conditions, changes or events affect Parent in a materially disproportionate and adverse manner when compared to companies of similar size operating in the same industry or market as Parent; provided, however, that the bankruptcy of Parent shall be considered to be a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (iii) changes in Laws or GAAP or interpretations thereof, except to the extent that such changes affect Parent in a materially disproportionate and adverse manner when compared to companies of similar size operating in the same industry or market as Parent; (iv) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, any actions taken in compliance with this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; (v) any failure by Parent to meet estimates of revenues or earnings for any period ending after the date of this Agreement (provided that the underlying causes of any such failure may be considered in determining whether a Parent

  Material Adverse Effect has occurred); (vi) the downgrade in rating of any

such downgrade may be considered in determining whether a Parent Material

take any action) required or contemplated by this Agreement or the taking of
any action (or omitting to take any action) that ATN has requested or to which

Other than with respect to Parents Subsidiaries, Parent does not directly or indirectly own any equity interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business entity, other than equity interests held for investment that are not, in the aggregate, material to Parent. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, all of the equity interests Parent owns in each of its Subsidiaries, whether directly or through Parents Subsidiaries, are held free and clear of any Lien (other than in favor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries), no equity interests of any of Parents Subsidiaries are or may become required to be issued by reason of any Rights, there are no contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any of Parents Subsidiaries is or may be bound to sell or otherwise transfer any equity interests of any such Subsidiaries, there are no contracts, commitments, understandings, or arrangements relating to Parents rights to vote or to dispose of such equity interests, and all of the equity interests of each such Subsidiary held by Parent or its Subsidiaries are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens.

COVENANTS

 

 ATN hereby covenants to and agrees with Parent, and Parent hereby covenants to and agrees with ATN, that:

 

 Section 7.1 _Reasonable Best Efforts._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of ATN and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, desirable or advisable under applicable Laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as soon as reasonably practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including (a) obtaining Consent in respect of the ATN Credit Agreement, (b) taking such actions as set forth in _Section 7.7_ , (c) using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (d) using reasonable best efforts to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material damages.

 Section 7.2 _Equityholder Approvals._

 

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, ATN shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Operating Agreement, all action necessary to call, convene and hold, as soon as reasonably practicable, an appropriate meeting of members of ATN to consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the Merger and any other matters required to be approved by the holders of Class A Units and the holders of ATN Common Units for consummation of the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the " _ATN Meeting_ ") promptly after the date that the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 7.2(a)_ , the ATN Board and the ATN Special Committee shall recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereunder, including the Merger, to its holders of Class A Units and holders of ATN Common Units (the " _ATN Recommendation_ "), and each of Parent and ATN shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by ATN Unitholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining ATN Unitholder Approval, the ATN Board or the ATN Special Committee may withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent the ATN Recommendation (any such action being referred to as an " _ATN Change in Recommendation_ ") if they have concluded in good faith, after consultation with, and

  taking into account the advice of their outside legal advisors, that the
failure to make an ATN Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
applicable fiduciary duties.

 

 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all action necessary to call, convene and hold, as soon as reasonably practicable, an appropriate meeting of the holders of the Parent Common Stock to consider and vote upon the approval of the Stock Issuance and the adoption of the Charter Amendment and any other matters required to be approved or adopted by them for consummation of the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the " _Parent Meeting_ "; and each of the ATN Meeting and Parent Meeting, a " _Meeting_ "), promptly after the date that the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Subject to the last sentence of this _Section 7.2(b)_ , the Parent Board shall recommend approval of the Stock Issuance and the Charter Amendment to the holders of Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent Recommendation_ ").

 (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent ATN or the ATN Board or Parent or the Parent Board from taking and disclosing to its equityholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to equityholders) or from making any legally required disclosure to its equityholders, it being understood that any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by ATN, the ATN Board, Parent or the Parent Board to its equityholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the unitholders of ATN) shall not be considered an ATN Change in Recommendation or Parent Change in Recommendation, as the case may be.

 

 (d) The obligation of ATN to call, hold and convene the ATN Meeting shall not be affected by an ATN Change in Recommendation, and the obligation of Parent to call, hold and convene the Parent Meeting shall not be affected by a Parent Change in Recommendation.

 

 (e) So long as the ATN Recommendation remains unchanged at the time of the Parent Meeting, Parent and Atlas Energy Management shall vote all of their ATN Common Units and Class A Units to approve the Merger, adopt this Agreement and approve any other matters required to be approved by holders of Class A Units and the holders of ATN Common Units for consummation of the Merger; provided, however, that Parent and Atlas Energy Management may, but shall not be required, to vote their ATN Common Units and Class A Units in such manner if there is an ATN Change in Recommendation.

The Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and other applicable Law. Each of Parent and ATN also agrees to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby.

Neither ATN nor Parent nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the limited liability company operating agreement or similar governing document of the Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Operating Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law.

 (e) The provisions of _Section 7.8(d)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained by the Surviving Entity for purposes of this

  _Section 7.8_ from carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of
such insurances as of the date of this Agreement, which policies provide such
directors and officers with the coverage described in _Section 7.8(d)_ for an

from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including,
in respect of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (g) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 7.8_.

  members of the ATN Board, all of whom must be independent within the meaning
ascribed thereto by NASDAQ (the " _ATN Director Designees_ ") to serve as
members of the Parent Board following the Effective Time. Subject to the
foregoing, the parties shall take such action as is necessary to cause the ATN
Director Designees to be appointed to the Parent Board effective as of the
Effective Time, to serve until the earlier of such individuals resignation or
removal or until his successor is duly elected and qualified.

 

 Section 7.12 _Name Change_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause its name to be changed to "Atlas Energy, Inc." or such other name as mutually agreed by Parent and ATN.

TERMINATION

 

 Section 9.1 _Termination._ Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time whether before or after the ATN Unitholder Approval or Parent Stockholder approval:

 

(a) By the mutual consent of Parent and ATN in a written instrument;

 

(b) By either ATN or Parent upon written notice to the other, if:

 

 (i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before February 28, 2010 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement or other breach of this Agreement has been a cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to have been consummated on or before such date;

 

 (ii) any Governmental Authority has issued a statute, rule, order, decree or regulation or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining

  or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or making the Merger
illegal and such statute, rule, order, decree, regulation or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable (provided that the terminating party
has complied with its obligations hereunder);

 

 (iii) ATN fails to obtain the ATN Unitholder Approval at the ATN Meeting;

 

 (iv) there has been a material breach of or any inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of any of the other parties (treating Parent and Merger Sub as one party for the purposes of this _Section 9.1_ ), which breach is not cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the terminating party, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date (provided in any such case that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein); provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(iv)_ unless (x) the breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under _Section 8.5_ (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by Parent or Merger Sub) or _Section 8.6_ (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by ATN), and (y) such terminating party is not in material breach of this Agreement;

 

 (v) if there has been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on the part of any of the other parties, which breach has not been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach from the terminating party, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date (provided in any such case that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein); provided, however, that no party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(b)(v)_ unless (x) the breach of covenants or agreements, together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving the benefit of such covenants or agreements not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under _Section 8.5_ (in the case of a breach of covenants or agreements by Parent or Merger Sub) or _Section 8.6_. (in the case of a breach of covenants or agreements by ATN), and (y) such terminating party is not in material breach of this Agreement; or

 

 (vi) Parent fails to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval at the Parent Meeting;

 

 (c) By ATN (with the prior approval of the ATN Special Committee), upon written notice to Parent, in the event that a Parent Change in Recommendation has occurred; or

  (d) By Parent, upon written notice to ATN, in the event that an ATN Change in Recommendation has occurred.

 

 Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_ , written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other parties specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and except as provided in this _Section 9.2_ , this Agreement (other than _Article X_ ) shall forthwith become null and void after the expiration of any applicable period following such notice. In the event of such termination, there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or ATN; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability or obligation with respect to any fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement.

 Section 10.6 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Except as contemplated by _Section 7.8_ , nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 Section 10.7 _Severability._ Any provision of this Agreement which is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

 

 Section 10.8 _Headings._ The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are not part of this Agreement.

 

 Section 10.9 _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or the Delaware Court of Chancery, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in _Section 10.6_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

 Section 10.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

  LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 Section 10.11 _Specific Performance._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or in the Delaware Court of Chancery, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

 

 Section 10.12 _Scope of Representations and Warranties._

 

 (a) Except as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement, ATN makes no, and disclaims any, representations or warranties whatsoever, whether express or implied. ATN disclaims all liability or responsibility for any other statement or information made or communicated (orally or in writing) to Merger Sub, Parent, their Affiliates or any stockholder, officer, director, employee, representative, consultant, attorney, agent, lender or other advisor of Merger Sub, Parent or their Affiliates (including, but not limited to, any opinion, information or advice which may have been provided to any such person by any Representative of ATN or any other person or contained in the files or records of ATN), wherever and however made.

 

 (b) Except as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement Parent does not make and disclaims, any representations or warranties whatsoever, whether express or implied. Each of Merger Sub and Parent disclaims all liability and responsibility for any other statement or information made or communicated (orally or in writing) to ATN, its Affiliates or any member, officer, director, employee, representative, consultant, attorney, agent, lender or other advisor of ATN or its Affiliates (including, but not limited to, any opinion, information or advice which may have been provided to any such person by any Representative Parent or any other person), wherever and however made.

 

 (c) Any representation "to the knowledge" or "to the best knowledge" of a party or phrases of similar wording shall be limited to matters within the actual conscious awareness of the executive officers of such party and any manager or managers of such party who have primary responsibility for the substantive area or operations in question and who report directly to such executive officers after reasonable inquiry.

 

 Section 10.13 _Survival._ All representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing; provided, however, that if the Closing occurs, the agreements of the parties in _Sections 3.2_ , _3.6_ , _7.8_ and _Article X_ shall survive the Closing, and if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, the agreements of the parties in _Section 7.5(b)_ , _9.2_ , and _Article X_ shall survive such termination.

 

 Section 10.14 _Confidentiality_. Except for disclosures (i) approved by (A) with respect to any disclosure by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, ATN, or (B) with respect to any

  disclosure by ATN or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent, or (B) as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement (including _Section 7.2(c)_ ) or required by
applicable Law, none of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates and representatives not to, publicly disclose any
confidential information or materials of the other party whether relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this _Section 10.14_ shall not prohibit a Person from making
any disclosure which, in the reasonable opinion of such Persons outside legal
counsel, is required to avoid a violation of applicable Law by such Person, in
which event the Person required to make such disclosure shall do so only to
the limited extent necessary to comply with such Law and shall give advance
notice thereof to the other Parties and an opportunity to comment on any such
disclosure and oppose the need therefor.

 

 Section 10.15 _Interpretation._

 

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits, Annexes or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit, Annex or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereby," "herein," "hereof" or "hereunder," and similar terms are to be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any specific section. The inclusion of any information in either the ATN Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement (as the case may be) shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information therein, that such information is required to be included therein or material to ATN or any of its Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be. The disclosure of information in the ATN Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to, or for purposes of, a representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception to, or for purposes of, all other representations, warranties and covenants herein. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the ATN Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 

 (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
