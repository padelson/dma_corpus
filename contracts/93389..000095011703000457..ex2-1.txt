          (b) Subject to Section 7.9(b) hereof, to the extent that any
conveyances, assignments, transfers and deliveries contemplated by this
Agreement have not occurred as of the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate to effect such action as promptly thereafter as is practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Sellers nor Buyer will be liable in any
manner to any Person who is not a party to this Agreement for any failure of any
of the transfers contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on or
subsequent to the Closing Date. Whether or not all of the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities have been legally transferred to or assumed by Buyer as of
the Closing Date, Buyer will have, and will be deemed to have acquired, complete
and sole beneficial ownership over all of the Acquired Assets, including any
Nonassignable Assets, together with all of Sellers' rights, powers and
privileges incident thereto, and Buyer will be deemed to have assumed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement all of the Assumed Liabilities and
all of Sellers' Liabilities, duties, obligations and responsibilities incident
thereto.

          (c) Nothing in this Section 1.3 shall be construed to waive or modify
any right of Buyer to require a Consent set forth on Schedule 4.2(p) as a
condition to Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

whether such Liability attaches or accrues to Buyer or Sellers in the first

                                  ARTICLE III

                                 PURCHASE PRICE

     3.1 Purchase Price. In full consideration for the transfer of the Acquired
Assets, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of
the Closing Net Book Value or $125,000,000, except as otherwise provided in
Section 3.3(h) (the "Purchase Price"), and shall assume the Assumed Liabilities.

     3.2 Payment of Purchase Price.

          (a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay the Estimated Purchase Price
(as defined in Section 3.3(b)) to Dana, as agent for Sellers, as follows:


                                       6                Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

               (i) Seventy-five percent (75%) of the Estimated Purchase Price in
     cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
     designated by Dana prior to the Closing;

               (ii) the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
     Buyer's common stock, $2.00 par value (the "Common Shares"), obtained by
     dividing the amount equal to twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the
     Estimated Purchase Price by the average closing price of the Common Shares
     on the New York Stock Exchange during the ten trading days immediately
     preceding the Closing Date (the "Price Per Share"); the Common Shares to be
     issued pursuant to this Section 3.2(a)(ii) are herein referred to as the
     "Seller Shares," and the Seller Shares shall be issued to the Seller
     Designee and held by it pursuant to the terms of the Share Ownership
     Agreement; and

               (iii) a promissory note, payable to the Seller Designee and
     having an original principal amount equal to twelve and one-half percent
     (12.5%) of the Estimated Purchase Price, substantially in the form of
     Exhibit A hereto (the "Seller Note").

          (b) To the extent that the computation provided for in Section
3.2(a)(ii) would result in the issuance to the Seller Designee of fractional
shares, the number of Seller Shares will be reduced to the next lowest whole
number and the cash payment to be made by Buyer under Section 3.2(a)(i) will be
increased by an amount equal to the Price Per Share multiplied by such
fractional interest.

     3.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

          (a) As used herein, the term "Closing Net Book Value" means the net
book value of the Acquired Assets less the net book value of the Assumed
Liabilities as of the close of business on the Closing Date and as such values
are determined in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles and
reflected in the Final Net Book Value Statement.

          (b) On the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer an Estimated Closing Net Book Value
Statement determined using the most recent financial statements delivered to
Buyer pursuant to Section 7.17 (the "Estimated Closing Net Book Value
Statement"). The net book value of the Acquired Assets less the net book value
of the Assumed Liabilities as reflected on the Estimated Closing Net Book Value
Statement shall be the "Estimated Closing Net Book Value." Buyer shall pay Dana,
as agent for Sellers, an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of $125,000,000 or
the Estimated Closing Net Book Value (the "Estimated Purchase Price"), allocated
among cash, the Seller Shares and the Seller Note in accordance with the
percentages set forth in Section 3.2(a). If the Estimated Closing Net Book Value
as determined from the Estimated Closing Net Book Value Statement delivered by
Sellers would exceed $125,000,000 (such excess being referred to below as the
"Estimated NBV Excess"), then there shall be excluded from the Acquired Assets,
and included within the Retained Assets, Owned Real Property selected by Dana as
agent for the Sellers and having a net book value (determined on the basis of
the Estimated Closing Net Book Value Statement) that equals as closely as
possible (but is not in any event less than) the Estimated NBV Excess. Such
excluded Owned Real Property shall be leased by the applicable Seller pursuant
to a Seller Lease. In such event, the Estimated Closing


                                       7                Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

Net Book Value Statement and the Specified Accounting Principles shall be
revised to give effect to the exclusion of such Owned Real Property from the
Acquired Assets, and the Estimated Purchase Price shall be determined on the
basis of such revised Estimated Closing Net Book Value Statement.

          (c) Within sixty days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement of the Closing Net Book Value (the "Closing Net
Book Value Statement"). The Closing Net Book Value Statement will be prepared in
accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles.

          (d) Buyer shall allow Sellers and Sellers' independent accountants
("Sellers' Accountants") access during normal business hours to the business,
books, records and personnel of the EMG Business to the extent necessary for the
preparation of the Closing Net Book Value Statement, and Buyer shall cooperate
and direct its personnel and its independent accountants ("Buyer's Accountants")
to cooperate with Sellers and Sellers' Accountants in all reasonable respects to
facilitate preparation and delivery of the Closing Net Book Value Statement and
in connection with the resolution of any disputes with respect thereto and the
determination of the Final Net Book Value Statement. Buyer and its
representatives, including Buyer's Accountants, will be entitled to review all
work papers, if any, of Sellers' Accountants prepared subsequent to the date
hereof and related to the Closing Net Book Value Statement to the extent
necessary for Buyer to review the Closing Net Book Value Statement and to
resolve any disputes concerning the same.

          (e) The Closing Net Book Value Statement delivered by Sellers to Buyer
will be the Final Net Book Value Statement and will be conclusive and binding on
the Parties unless Buyer, within the thirty-day period after the delivery to
Buyer of the Closing Net Book Value Statement, notifies Sellers in writing that
Buyer disputes any of the amounts set forth therein, specifying the nature of
each dispute and the basis therefor (the "Dispute Notice"); provided, however,
that Buyer may deliver a Dispute Notice to Sellers only if Buyer reasonably
believes that the Closing Net Book Value Statement contains mathematical errors
or has not been prepared in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles.
Sellers and its representatives, including Sellers' Accountants, will be
entitled to review all work papers, if any, of Buyer's Accountants prepared
subsequent to the date hereof and related to the Closing Net Book Value
Statement to the extent necessary for Seller to resolve any disputes concerning
the Closing Net Book Value Statement. Failure by Buyer to dispute the amounts
reflected in the Closing Net Book Value Statement within such thirty-day period
will be deemed by Buyer's acceptance of the Closing Net Book Value Statement as
the Final Net Book Value Statement. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to
reach agreement resolving all of the disputes set forth in the Dispute Notice
within thirty days after the Dispute Notice is delivered by Buyer to Sellers, in
which event the Closing Net Book Value Statement, as amended, if necessary, to
reflect the resolution of all such disputes, will be the Final Net Book Value
Statement and will be conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the Parties are
unable to resolve any or all of such disputes within the aforesaid thirty-day
period, the Parties will, promptly after the expiration of such time period,
submit for resolution all unresolved disputes to a mutually acceptable
independent accounting firm (the "Designated Accounting Arbitrator") as an
arbiter for resolution. Promptly, but no later than thirty days after its
acceptance of its appointment as Designated Accounting Arbitrator, the
Designated


                                       8                Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

Accounting Arbitrator shall determine, based solely on presentation by Buyer and
Sellers and not by independent review, those items in dispute on the Closing Net
Book Value Statement and shall render a written report to Buyer and Sellers as
to the resolution of each dispute and the resulting calculation of the Final Net
Book Value Statement and the Closing Net Book Value. In resolving any disputed
item, the Designated Accounting Arbitrator may not assign a value to such item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The Designated
Accounting Arbitrator will have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resort to the
Designated Accounting Arbitrator as provided in this Section 3.3(e) will be the
sole recourse and remedy of, the Parties against one another or any other Person
(including Sellers' Accountants or Buyer's Accountants) with respect to any
disputes arising out of or relating to the Closing Net Book Value Statement
and/or the Final Net Book Value Statement. The Designated Accounting
Arbitrator's determination will be conclusive and binding on the Parties and
will be enforceable in a court of law.

          (f) Sellers shall pay the fees and expenses of Sellers' Accountants,
and Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of Buyer's Accountants. Buyer and
Sellers shall share equally the fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting
Arbitrator.

          (g) As used herein, the term "Final Net Book Value Statement" means
(i) the Closing Net Book Value Statement if no Dispute Notice is given by Buyer
within the time period set forth in Section 3.3(e); (ii) if the Dispute Notice
is timely given and all of the disputed items are resolved by mutual agreement
of the Parties, the Closing Net Book Value Statement, as amended, if necessary,
to reflect such resolution of all disputes; or (iii) if any or all of the
disputed items are submitted to the Designated Accounting Arbitrator for
resolution, the Closing Net Book Value Statement, as amended, if necessary, to
reflect any resolution of any disputes by mutual agreement of the Parties and
the resolution of all other disputes by the Designated Accounting Arbitrator.

          (h) If the Closing Net Book Value exceeds $125,000,000, then Buyer
shall, at its option, (i) pay to Sellers the amount of such excess in cash or
(ii) assign to the Seller Designee accounts receivable of the EMG Business,
selected on the basis of the criteria set forth on Schedule 3.3(h), in an
aggregate amount which equals the amount of such excess. If the Purchase Price
is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then: effective as of the Closing
Date, such difference shall be applied to reduce the amount of the cash, the
number of Seller Shares, and the principal amount of the Seller Note that were
paid or delivered on the Closing Date, such reduction to be made in accordance
with the percentages in Section 3.2(a); and in furtherance thereof, Sellers
shall pay to Buyer the amount of any reduction in the cash component of the
Purchase Price (plus interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum from the Closing
Date) and shall transfer to Buyer the applicable number of Seller Shares, and
Buyer shall issue to the Seller Designee a replacement Seller Note for the
reduced principal amount. Alternatively, if the Purchase Price is greater than
the Estimated Purchase Price, then: effective as of the Closing Date, such
difference shall be applied to increase the amount of the cash, the number of
Seller Shares and the principal amount of the Seller Note, such increase to be
made in accordance with the percentages set forth in Section 3.2(a); and in
furtherance thereof, Buyer shall pay to the Seller Designee the amount of any
increase in the cash component of the Purchase Price (plus interest thereon at a
rate of 5% per annum from the Closing Date) and


                                       9                Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

shall issue to Seller Designee the applicable number of Seller Shares, and Buyer
shall issue to the Seller Designee a replacement Seller Note for the increased
principal amount. Seller and Buyer shall make payment, shall transfer or issue
such Seller Shares and shall issue such replacement Seller Note within ten (10)
Business Days after the date on which the Final Net Book Value Statement is
determined. Any such payment of cash shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the payee. To the extent
that the adjustments provided for in the foregoing sentences would result in the
transfer or issuance of fractional shares, the number of Seller Shares so
transferred or issued will be reduced to the next lowest whole number and the
Party transferring or issuing such shares shall pay the other Party an amount in
cash equal to the Price Per Share multiplied by such fractional interest. Upon
receipt from Buyer of a replacement promissory note providing for any such
revised principal amount, the Seller Designee shall promptly return the original
Seller Note.

     3.4 Purchase Price Allocation. The Purchase Price, plus the aggregate
amount of the Assumed Liabilities included in the amount realized on the sale of
Acquired Assets for federal income tax purposes, will be allocated among the
Acquired Assets and the non-competition agreement described in Section 7.16 in
accordance with the allocation schedule attached hereto as Schedule 3.4. Such
schedule shall be adjusted as the parties agree to reflect any adjustment
pursuant to Section 3.3(h) to the Purchase Price or to the amount of Assumed
Liabilities included in the amount realized on the sale of the Acquired Assets
for federal income tax purposes. Unless otherwise required under applicable Law,
Buyer and Sellers shall report the purchase and sale of the Acquired Assets on
all Tax Returns, including timely filed Internal Revenue Service Forms 8594, in
accordance with the allocation shown on such schedule, as adjusted. All
allocations made pursuant to this Section 3.4 will be binding upon the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take
any position (whether in returns, audits, or otherwise) which is inconsistent
with the allocation shown on such schedule.

     Each Seller jointly and severally represents and warrants to Buyer as
follows:

     5.1 Organization and Standing. Each Seller is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state
of its incorporation. Each Seller is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in the states of the United States in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it and used by it in the EMG Business or in which
the conduct of the EMG Business requires it to be so qualified, except where the
failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the EMG Business.

     5.2 Authority, Validity and Effect. Each Seller has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each Seller's execution, delivery
and performance of its obligations under this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all required corporate action.
This Agreement has been, and each of the Ancillary Agreements will be as of the
Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by each Seller party hereto or
thereto. This Agreement is, and each Ancillary Agreement will, when so executed
and delivered, be, the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Seller party
hereto or thereto, enforceable against it in accordance with the terms hereof or
thereof, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and (ii) the
availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

     5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

          (a) Neither the execution and delivery by any Seller of this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements, nor the consummation by such Seller of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein, nor compliance by such Seller with
any of the provisions hereof or thereof, will, except as set forth on Schedule
5.3(a), (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of such
Seller's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws (or equivalent organizational
documents); (ii) conflict with, constitute or result in the breach of any term,
condition or provision of, or constitute a default under, result in or give rise
to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration with respect to, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of the Acquired Assets
pursuant to, or require any notice under, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
Contract or other instrument or obligation to which any Seller is a party or by
which the EMG Business is subject, and that, in any such event, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the EMG Business; or (iii)
subject to receipt of the requisite approvals referred to in Section 5.3(b),

Agreement has been, and each of the Ancillary Agreements will be as of the
Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by Buyer. This Agreement is, and each
Ancillary Agreement will, when so executed and delivered, be, the legal, valid
and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against it in accordance with the
terms hereof or thereof, except as limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect and (ii)
the availability of equitable remedies (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity). No approval by the holders of
the Common Shares is required in order for Buyer to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements,
including its obligation to deliver the Seller Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof.

     6.3 Capitalization; Title to Stock. The authorized capital stock of Buyer
consists of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, $2.00 par value per share, of
which 12,557,009 shares were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2002. All
of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly
authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. When issued in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller Shares will be validly
authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will not be issued in
violation of preemptive rights. Except as disclosed in the Buyer Reports
(including the financial statements included therein): there are no outstanding
subscriptions, Contracts, options, rights (preemptive or otherwise) or warrants
to purchase or to subscribe for any shares of common stock or any other
securities of Buyer, including through the conversion, exchange or exercise of
any other right or securities; and there are no stockholder agreements or voting
trusts relating to the Common Shares.

     6.4 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

          (a) Neither the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement or
of any of the Ancillary Agreements, nor the consummation by Buyer of the
transactions contemplated herein or therein, nor compliance by Buyer with any of
the provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provision of Buyer's Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, (ii) except as
set forth on Schedule 6.4(a), conflict with, constitute or result in the breach
of any term, condition or provision of, or constitute a default under, result in

respect to, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any
material property or assets of Buyer pursuant to, or require


                                       23               Asset Purchase Agreement

any notice under, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, Contract or other
instrument or obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which it or any of its
material properties or assets may be subject, and that, in any such event, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer's business or
(iii) subject to receipt of the requisite approvals referred to in Section
6.4(b), violate any Order or Law to which Buyer or its Subsidiaries or any of
their businesses are subject.

          (b) Other than (i) those required under the HSR Act, (ii) those set
forth on Schedule 6.4(b) and (iii) where the failure to give such notice, make
such filing or receive such Consent would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Buyer's business, no notice to, filing with,
authorization of, exemption by or Consent of any Person is necessary for the
consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

     6.5 SEC Filings. Buyer has filed all reports required to be filed by it
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 1999
(collectively, together with any amendments, the "Buyer Reports"). None of the
Buyer Reports, as of their respective dates, contained any untrue statement of
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

     6.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth in the Buyer Reports,
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has sustained since the date of the
latest financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Buyer
Reports, any material loss or interference with its business from fire,
explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from
any labor dispute or Action or Order of any Governmental Authority. Except as
set forth in the Buyer Reports, since the date of such financial statements,
there has not been any change in the capital stock or long-term Indebtedness of
Buyer (other than changes in the outstanding principal balance of such long-term
Indebtedness permitted by the terms thereof described in the Buyer Reports) or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Material Adverse Effect, or any development that
is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, in or affecting
Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

     6.7 Legal Proceedings. Except as set forth in the Buyer Reports, there are
no Actions instituted, commenced or pending, or to Buyer's Knowledge,
threatened, against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or against any of their
respective properties, assets, interests or rights that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the business of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries if decided adversely or that would restrict the consummation of the
transactions under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Neither Buyer
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Order that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on its business.

     6.8 Compliance with Laws. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on its business, or as set forth in the Buyer
Reports, each of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (a) is in compliance with, and since
January 1, 1999, has been in compliance with, all Laws and Orders applicable to
it or its business; and (b) since January 1, 1999, has not received any written
notification or communication from any Governmental Authority


                                       24               Asset Purchase Agreement

(i) asserting that such Person is not in compliance with any Law; or (ii)
threatening to revoke any material Permit necessary for the operation of its
business.

     6.9 Exemption from Registration. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties made by Sellers and Seller Designee in Section
5.20 through Section 5.23, Buyer is entitled to issue to the Seller Shares and
the Seller Note to the Seller Designee pursuant to an exemption from
registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D
promulgated thereunder and under similar exemptions from registration under
applicable state securities Laws.

     6.10 Financial Ability. Buyer has delivered to Sellers true and complete
copies of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by and among Buyer, General
Electric Capital Corporation and the other lenders party thereto, in the form
anticipated to be executed contemporaneously with this Agreement (together with
any other agreements contemplated thereby, the "Financing Agreements"), pursuant
to which such lenders have agreed to provide Buyer with debt financing for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and for other purposes, subject only
to the satisfaction of the Financing Conditions. The Financing Agreements have
not been modified in any material respect or terminated since they were
delivered to Sellers. If the Financing Conditions are satisfied, Buyer will have
sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

     6.11 No Brokers. Except for the compensation payable to Goldman Sachs
("Goldman") in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, which Buyer shall pay, no broker, finder or
similar agent has been employed by or on behalf of Buyer, and no Person with
which Buyer has had any dealings or communications of any kind other than
Goldman is entitled to any brokerage commission, finder's fee or any similar
compensation in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

the Ancillary Agreements or as set forth on Schedule 7.1, unless Buyer has
previously consented in writing thereto, Sellers shall not engage in any
practice, take any action, or enter into any transaction outside the Ordinary
Course of Business, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Sellers shall not cause or permit the EMG Business to:

          (a) incur any Indebtedness in connection with the EMG Business, other
than Indebtedness incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business;

          (b) acquire or dispose of any material property or assets used in the

          (c) enter into any Contracts in connection with the EMG Business,
except Contracts made in the Ordinary Course of Business;

          (d) engage in any transactions with, or enter into any Contracts with,
any Affiliates of Sellers in connection with the EMG Business, except for any
such transactions or Contracts in the Ordinary Course of Business on terms no
less favorable than would be obtained in an arms' length third-party
transaction;

          (e) enter into, adopt, amend or terminate any Contract relating to the
compensation of any employee employed in the EMG Business or any severance with
respect to an employee that is subject to the Reimbursement Agreement, except to
the extent required by Law or any existing Contracts;

          (f) accelerate the rate of collection of Accounts Receivable other
than in the Ordinary Course of Business; or

          (g) agree to take any of the actions described in Sections 7.1(a)
through 7.1(f) above.

     7.2 Preservation of Business. From the date hereof until the Closing, each
Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep its business and
properties relating to the EMG Business substantially intact, including its
present operations, physical facilities, working conditions and relationships
with lessors, licensors, suppliers, customers and employees relating to the EMG
Business, except that Sellers may close or relocate the operations of the EMG
Business located at Franklin Park, Illinois and Guilford, Connecticut upon
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyer, such notice to contain the
details of such proposed closure or relocation. Sellers shall provide Buyer
prompt written notice of any of the events described in the proviso to the
definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect".

     7.3 Reasonable Access; Confidentiality.

          (a) From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers shall (i) give
Buyer and its representatives (including its lenders, underwriters or other
financing sources and its consultants preparing the Environmental Reports), upon
reasonable written notice to Sellers, access during normal business hours, and
in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations of the
EMG Business or Sellers, to all assets, properties, books, records (including
Tax records), Contracts, documents and personnel relating to the EMG Business;
(ii) permit Buyer to make such inspections as it may reasonably require,
including, without limitation, the inspections contemplated in subsection (b) of
the Section 7.3; and (iii) furnish Buyer during such period with all such
information relating to the EMG Business as Buyer may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: in no event will Sellers be required to give
Buyer access if the nature or timing of such access would interrupt any Seller's
normal business operations; and, except as set forth in the next succeeding
sentence, Sellers shall not be required to deliver to Buyer copies of any
Contracts, or any other information regarding the terms of Sellers'
arrangements, with the material customers of the EMG Business, to the extent
that Sellers in good faith deem such information to be of a nature that they
would not reasonably be expected to provide to a competitor (the "Customer
Information"). Not later


                                       26               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

than eighteen (18) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Sellers shall
provide to representatives of Buyer an opportunity to review copies of any
Customer Information not previously provided to Buyer, at 4500 Dorr Street,
Toledo, Ohio. Buyer's representatives shall be permitted to make notes regarding
such Customer Information but not to remove or retain copies of the Customer
Information prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall make available to Buyer's
representatives during such review representatives of Sellers who are familiar
with and able to respond to questions about the Customer information.

          (b) From the date hereof until the Closing, Sellers shall, upon
reasonable written notice to Sellers, permit Buyer, during normal business
hours, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the normal business
operations of the EMG Business or Sellers, to inspect the Acquired Assets and
the Retained Assets and Sellers' books and records in order to verify the
accuracy of the information with respect thereto set forth in the Disclosure
Schedules or on any Exhibit to this Agreement. In the event that Buyer believes
that any asset classified as a Retained Asset in the Disclosure Schedules or on
an Exhibit has not been properly so classified in accordance with the provisions
of Section 1.2, or that any liability classified as an Assumed Liability in the
Disclosure Schedules or on an Exhibit has not been properly so classified in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1, Buyer may notify Dana of such
belief in writing. If, after such further discussions as the parties deem
necessary or desirable, Dana and Buyer agree that any such assets or liabilities
were improperly classified, then Sellers and Buyer shall amend the applicable
Disclosure Schedules or Exhibits accordingly.

          (c) Any information provided to or obtained by Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) above is "Evaluation Material" as defined under the
Confidentiality Agreement dated January 25, 2002, by and between Dana and Buyer
(as amended through the date hereof, the "Confidentiality Agreement") and is to
be held by Buyer in accordance with and subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

          (d) Each Party will be bound by and comply with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement as if such provisions were set forth herein, and such
provisions are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

          (e) Buyer shall indemnify Sellers and hold Sellers and their Related
Persons harmless from and against any and all Liabilities for property damage or
personal injury suffered or incurred by Sellers or their Related Persons arising
out of or resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer or
Buyer's representatives in connection with any inspection or other activities
conducted by Buyer or Buyer's representatives pursuant to this Agreement.

     7.4 Antitrust Filings.

          (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby within fourteen (14) days after the date hereof; (ii) supply
as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may thereafter be requested pursuant to the HSR Act; and (iii) cause


                                       27               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable.

          (b) In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 7.4(a), each
of the Parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate
with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection
with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other Parties informed in all material respects of
any material communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party
to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Authority and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (iii) permit the other Parties to review any material communication
given to it by, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or in
connection with any proceeding by a private party. Each of the Parties shall
coordinate and cooperate fully with the other Parties in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as such other Parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act.

          (c) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Authority
or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of the HSR Act, each of the Parties shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such objections or challenge as such Governmental
Authority or private party may have to such transactions, including to vacate,
lift, reverse or overturn any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4 to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be required to take any action or to agree to any modification
of the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement in order to cause the
expiration or termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or to resolve
any objection or challenge of any Governmental Authority or a private party if
the Buyer determines in its good faith judgment that the effect of such action
or modification would be to cause a Material Adverse Effect to Buyer or the EMG
Business or to impair materially the value to the Buyer of the EMG Business.

     7.5 Other Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cooperate
with each other in making any filings that are required to be made prior to the
Closing Date with, and seeking any Consents that are required to be obtained
prior to the Closing Date from, Governmental Authorities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (in addition to
the filings and Consents contemplated by Section 7.4); and (b) cause the
conditions to their respective obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to be fulfilled.

<PAGE>

     7.6 Buyer Financing. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
satisfy all of the Financing Conditions, including consummation of the Equity
Offering; and (b) provide Sellers such information as they may reasonably
request from time to time about the performance by Buyer of its obligations
under Section 7.6(a). Buyer shall give Dana reasonable prior notice of any
amendment to the Financing Agreements that would modify any of the Financing
Conditions applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

     7.7 Notice of Developments. Each Party will give prompt written notice to
the other Party of any material adverse development causing a breach of any of
its own representations and warranties in Article V and Article VI above. No
disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section 7.7, however, shall be deemed
to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules or to prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or breach of covenant.

     7.8 Publicity. Sellers and Buyer shall make a joint press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, which release will be acceptable
to each of Sellers and Buyer. No other publicity release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements is to be issued by either Party without the advance written consent
of such other Party; provided that either Party may make any such release or
announcement that is required under applicable Law or any listing or trading
agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in which case the
disclosing Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to advise the other
Party prior to making the disclosure).

     7.9 Further Assurances; Subsequent Transfers.

          (a) Each Seller and Buyer will execute and deliver such further
instruments of conveyance, transfer and assignment and will take such other
actions as either of them may reasonably request of the other in order to
effectuate the purposes of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to
carry out the terms hereof and thereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, at the
request of Buyer and without further consideration therefor, Sellers will
execute and deliver to Buyer such other instruments of transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation and will take such action as Buyer may reasonably
deem necessary or desirable in order more effectively to transfer, convey and
assign to Buyer and to confirm Buyer's title to any Acquired Assets, to put
Buyer in actual possession and operating control thereof and to permit Buyer to
exercise all rights with respect thereto (including rights with respect to
Nonassignable Assets). In addition, at the request of Sellers and without
further consideration therefor, Buyer will execute and deliver to Sellers all
instruments, undertakings or other documents and will take such other action as
Sellers may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to cause Buyer to
properly assume and discharge the Assumed Liabilities and to relieve Sellers of
any Liability with respect thereto and to evidence the same to third parties.

          (b) Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
Consent required to assign the Nonassignable Assets to Buyer, and Buyer will
cooperate in any commercially reasonable manner that Seller requests; provided,
however, that neither Sellers nor Buyer will be obligated to pay any
consideration (except for de minimis filing fees and


                                       29               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

other administrative charges) to the third party from whom such Consents are
requested; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall be
construed to waive any requirement that a Consent be obtained as a condition to
the Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In the event and to the extent that
Sellers and Buyer are unable to obtain any such required Consent through the use
of commercially reasonable methods, and if Buyer waives the receipt of such
Consent as a condition precedent under Section 9.3, then from and after the
Closing Date, unless prohibited by Law or the terms thereof, (i) Sellers will
continue to be bound by the terms of such Nonassignable Assets and (ii) Buyer
shall pay, perform and discharge fully all the obligations of Sellers thereunder
from and after the Closing Date and indemnify Sellers and their Related Persons
for all Damages arising out of any failure of such performance by Buyer. Sellers
shall, without further consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to Buyer
promptly all monies, rights and other considerations received in respect of such
performance by Buyer. Sellers shall exercise or exploit its rights and options
under all such Nonassignable Assets only as reasonably directed by Buyer and at
Buyer's expense. If and when any such Consent is obtained or such Nonassignable
Assets otherwise become assignable or able to be novated, Sellers shall promptly
assign and novate all its rights and obligations thereunder to Buyer, without
payment of further consideration therefor, and Buyer shall, without the payment
of any further consideration therefor, assume all such rights and obligations.

and Apportionable Expenses related to or arising from time periods including or
after the Closing Date will be borne by Buyer.

          (b) If, following the Closing Date, any Seller or Buyer receives any
payment relating to any property of the other party, such payment will remain
the property of the respective party and such Seller and Buyer will cooperate to
immediately forward such payment to the appropriate party.

Buyer shall not cause or permit the destruction or disposal of financial records
(other than Tax records, which are provided for in Section 7.13) relating to
periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering to surrender them to
Sellers, and Buyer shall allow Sellers and their representatives access to such
records during regular business hours.

first providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy
the same at the cost of such other party.

          (b) Buyer shall pay any state and local sales, transfer or similar

delivered to Buyer notice of Dana's desire to undertake such assignment, sale or

range of price it might be prepared to pay. If Buyer notifies Dana that Buyer
does not desire to consider such transaction or if Buyer does not submit any
notice to Dana within the thirty (30) day time period, neither Dana nor any of
its Affiliates shall have any further obligation to Buyer in respect of any
assignment, transfer or sale of the capital stock or assets of CUMSA,
Echlin-Mexicana or both, and the provisions of Section 7.23(b) shall cease to
apply. If Buyer notifies Dana within the thirty (30) day time period that Buyer

Period"), Buyer and the applicable Sellers shall negotiate the terms and
conditions of the purchase of the assets or capital stock of CUMSA,

as the case may be, (ii) permit Buyer to make such inspections as it may
reasonably require and (iii) furnish Buyer during such period with all such
information as Buyer may reasonably request.

          (b) During the Negotiation Period, the Sellers will not, directly or

or offer from any Person other than Buyer relating to the acquisition of any
capital stock of CUMSA, Echlin-Mexicana or both, as the case may be , or any

share exchange) or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in, or
facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person other than
Buyer to do or seek any of the foregoing.

          (c) If (i) by the end of the Negotiation Period Buyer or its designee
and the applicable Sellers have not executed a definitive agreement for the
transaction described in the Transfer Notice or (ii) such an agreement has been
executed by the end of the Negotiation Period but the purchase and sale
contemplated thereby has not been consummated within sixty (60) days after the
date of the definitive agreement for any reason except default by the applicable
Sellers of their obligations thereunder, then neither Dana nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any further obligation to Buyer in respect of any
assignment, sale or transfer of the capital stock or assets of CUMSA,
Echlin-Mexicana or both and shall be free to assign, sell or transfer capital
stock or assets to any Person on any terms.

          (d) The provisions of this Section 7.23 are not intended to apply to
(i) any assignment, pledge or other transfer of the capital stock or assets of
CUMSA, Echlin-Mexicana or both made in connection with financing arrangements
undertaken in the ordinary course of business by Dana or any of its Affiliates,
or (ii) any assignment, sale or transfer of the capital stock or assets of CUMSA

the EMG Business (including the Retained Business Lines relating to fuel pumps
and water pumps) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 and audited
statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended, fairly
presenting, in all material respects, the financial position and results of
operations of the EMG Business (including the Retained Business Lines relating

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     8.1 Site Assessment Environmental Liabilities. The term "Site Assessment
Environmental Liabilities" means, until the required environmental remediation
is complete at each respective site, all Environmental Costs relating to or
arising in connection with the remediation of Environmental Conditions at the
Branford Site, the Independence Site, and, if applicable, the Northvale Site,
identified during the Buyer's Further Investigations and/or Seller's Further
Investigations or during the performance of the Sellers' remediation. For
purposes of this Section 8.1, a required environmental remediation shall not be
deemed complete during the period of any continued operation and maintenance of
any active remediation system or long-term monitoring program (excluding, by way
of example, any static engineered controls such as a permanent cap) at the Real
Property in connection with the remediation or in the event that a No Further
Action letter or similar closure documentation is revoked, but only if the
reason for the revocation is the inaccuracy of information contained in Sellers'
submissions to Governmental Authorities.

     8.2 Environmental Remediation.

          (a) Phase II Investigations. Commencing not later than ten (10) days
after the date of this Agreement: Buyer shall conduct a Phase II Environmental
Site Assessment and such other investigation activities as Buyer deems necessary
or appropriate in order to ensure its entitlement to the "bona fide prospective
purchaser exemption" as defined under the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 'SS''SS'9601 et seq. at
the Real Property and facilities of Sellers located at (1) Independence, Kansas
(the "Independence Site"), (2) Branford, Connecticut (the "Branford Site"), and
(3) Northvale, New Jersey (the "Northvale Site") (in the event that Buyer's
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of the Northvale Site reveals the presence
of any "recognized environmental condition" as defined in ASTM 1527-97 or
1527-00) (collectively, the "Buyer's Further Investigation"). After Buyer
performs its Phase II Environmental Site Assessment at the Branford Site,
Sellers shall conduct any activities at the Branford Site as necessary to
discharge their obligations pursuant to the Connecticut Property Transfer Act,
'SS''SS'22a-134 et seq. (the "Sellers' Further Branford Investigation"). After
Buyer performs its Phase II Environmental Site Assessment at the Northvale Site,
Sellers shall conduct such activities at the Northvale Site as are necessary to
discharge its obligations pursuant to the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery
Act, N.J.S.A. 13:1K-6 et seq. (the "Sellers' Further Northvale Investigation").
(Seller's Further Branford Investigation and Further Northvale Investigation, as
well as any other investigation conducted by Sellers in discharging their
obligations under this Section 8.2, shall be collectively referred to herein as
"Seller's Further Investigation"). Sellers shall provide Buyer with such access
to the Northvale Site as Buyer deems necessary or desirable to


                                       38               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

conduct the Phase I Environmental Assessment of that site and shall provide
Buyer with such access to the Independence Site, Branford Site, and Northvale
Site as Buyer deems necessary or desirable to conduct the Buyer's Further
Investigation, as applicable. Sellers agree to reimburse Buyer for the amount of
costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with the Buyer's Further
Investigation up to an aggregate maximum reimbursement of $150,000. Sellers
shall make such reimbursement within thirty (30) days after receiving Buyer's
request for payment, accompanied by such supporting information as Sellers may
reasonably request. Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer written reports
of the Sellers' Further Investigation and Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Sellers written reports of the Buyer's Further Investigation, each in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and Buyer.

          (b) Remediation Activities. Sellers shall be solely responsible for,
and shall pay all Environmental Costs associated with, remediating the
Environmental Conditions identified during the Buyer's Further Investigations
and/or Sellers' Further Investigations or the performance of Sellers'
remediation at the Independence Site, the Branford Site and, if applicable, at
the Northvale Site, in accordance with the Minimum Remediation Standards and the
other terms and provisions of this Section 8.2. Except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.2(e), Sellers shall have absolute control over all aspects of any
remediation undertaken by Sellers. Sellers shall select and implement a remedy
that, in addition to meeting the Minimum Remediation Standards, does not
materially interfere with or disrupt Buyer's normal business activities at the
Real Property. Sellers shall perform any investigation activities as required
pursuant to this Section 8.2 in a manner that does not materially interfere with
or disrupt Buyer's normal business activities at the Real Property. Sellers
shall prepare a remediation plan within a reasonable time after receipt of
Buyer's Further Investigation for each site, which plan shall contain a schedule
that provides for the prompt completion of the remediation at each site. Upon
completion of each plan for each site, Seller shall submit it to Buyer in
advance of submitting it to any Governmental Authority. Buyer shall have the
right to consult with Sellers, and comment on Sellers' remediation plans and
remediation activities at Buyer's cost, provided that so long as Sellers have
materially complied with their obligations under this Section 8.2, Sellers shall
retain control over the preparation and implementation of the remediation plans
and all remediation activities, and in its sole discretion, may accept or reject
any comments or recommendations by Buyer. Buyer shall have the right to review,
comment on, and observe Sellers' remediation activities at Buyer's cost, but
Sellers shall retain control over Sellers' remediation activities, except as
otherwise provided in Section 8.2(e). Sellers agree to provide to Buyer copies
of all technical reports, studies, tests, documents or other materials in
connection with Sellers' remediation activities in a timely manner. Buyer shall
cooperate with and provide Seller with such access to the Independence Site and
the Branford Site as Sellers deem necessary or desirable to conduct Sellers'
Further Investigations and any remediation activities, provided, however, that
Sellers shall do so in a manner that does not materially disrupt Buyer's normal
business activities. Sellers shall obtain a "No Further Action" letter or
equivalent document from the applicable state governmental agency concluding
that no further remediation activities are required at the sites. Sellers shall
submit to the appropriate regulatory authority a remediation plan in a
reasonably timely manner, but in no case later than two (2) years after the
Closing Date, unless a delay is caused by factors outside the control of
Sellers, including but not limited to, unforeseen environmental conditions at
the Site, delays caused by Third Parties, or delays in governmental review or
approval of any submittals by Sellers. Sellers shall complete the remediation as
set forth in the


                                       39               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

remedial plans in a reasonably prompt manner, including, without limitation, by
conforming to the extent possible with the schedule for completion of the
remediation as set forth in the remedial plans. In the event that any of
Sellers' remedial plans involve any active remediation system or long-term
monitoring program (excluding, by way of example, any static engineered control
such as a permanent cap), Seller shall maintain and operate such system at its
sole expense until its receipt of a final No Further Action letter or similar
documentation providing that no further active remediation or monitoring is
required and until the remediation is complete within the meaning of Section 8.1
above.

          (c) Connecticut Property Transfer Act Responsibilities. Sellers shall
provide to Buyer by not later than 15 days prior to the Closing Date the
following documents with respect to the Branford facility: (i), a fully
completed Form III as defined pursuant to Conn. Stat. 'SS'22a-134(12),
signed and certified by Sellers as the "certifying party," that complies in all
respects with the Connecticut Property Transfer Act, 'SS''SS'22a-134 et seq.;
and (ii) documentation showing that the completed Form III has been submitted to
the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection
("DEP"). Sellers shall conduct any activities at the Branford Site as necessary
to discharge its obligations pursuant to the Connecticut Property Transfer Act,
'SS''SS'22a-134 et seq. and under Section 8.2(b).

          (d) New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act Responsibilities (ISRA).
Sellers shall provide to Buyer by not later than 15 days prior to the Closing
Date at least one of the following documents with respect to the Northvale
facility: (1) a non-applicability letter, (2) written approval of Seller's
negative declaration or "No Further Action" letter as to all areas of concern,
(3) an approved Remediation Agreement with funding source; or (4) a
non-qualified approval of Seller's Remedial Action Workplan, in each case as
such terms are defined in or customarily used in connection with ISRA.

          (e) Buyer's Right to Act. In addition to Buyer's rights to make a
claim for indemnification under Section 10.2 for a material breach by Sellers of
this Section 8.2, Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its
sole discretion, to conduct any investigation or take any remedial or other
appropriate action, at Sellers' cost and expense, if Sellers have not timely
performed any material obligation under this Section 8.2, provided that Buyer
shall have first provided written notice of such failure of Sellers to timely
perform such material obligation and Sellers have failed to cure such failure
within a 90-day period (except that this proviso shall not apply if Buyer
reasonably believes that its immediate action is necessary to prevent an
imminent threat to human health and, in such case, Buyer's right to act at
Sellers' cost with respect to such condition shall continue only for such time
and to such extent as appropriate under the circumstances to prevent and/or cure
any condition causing an imminent threat to human health). Notwithstanding the
90-day limitation on Sellers' right to cure after notice as provided in
foregoing sentence, if Sellers demonstrate in writing to Buyer that their
failure to perform a material obligation under this Section 8.2 cannot be cured
within such 90-day period, Seller shall have such additional time in which to
cure such failure as is reasonable under the circumstances.

     8.3 Environmental Records. For a period of ten years after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not cause or permit the destruction or disposal of
environmental records regarding the


                                       40               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

Acquired Assets or the EMG Real Property relating to periods prior to the
Closing Date without first offering to surrender them to Sellers, and Buyer
shall allow Sellers and their representatives access to such records during
regular business hours.

<PAGE>

          (d) No party providing indemnification pursuant to this Article X (an
"Indemnifying Party") is obligated to provide such indemnification with respect
to the representations and warranties (but not the covenants) to the other party
(the "Indemnified Party") unless the Indemnified Party has delivered written
notice of its claim for indemnification prior to the expiration of the
applicable period set forth in Section 10.1(a) or 10.1(b), unless such claim is
based upon the assertion that the Indemnifying Party had committed fraud;
provided, however, that any claim for indemnification for which a notice has
been given in accordance with Section 10.4 on or before the expiration of such
period may continue to be asserted and indemnified against until finally
resolved.

     10.2 Indemnification. Subject to the other provisions of this Article X,
from and after the Closing,

          (a) Sellers shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its officers,
directors, shareholders, employees and Affiliates harmless from and against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
Liabilities, losses, claims and damages (collectively, "Damages") resulting
from: (i) Sellers' breach of any representation or warranty made by them in or
pursuant to this Agreement, provided that Sellers shall not be liable for breach
of any representation or warranty to the extent (A) the fact, matter or
circumstance giving rise to a claim for breach is fairly disclosed in any of the
Disclosure Schedules to this Agreement or the documents attached thereto, or (B)
the amount claimed is reflected in the Final Net Book Value Statement or was the
subject of a Dispute Notice; (ii) Sellers' failure to perform or breach of any
covenant made by them in or pursuant to this Agreement; or (iii) Sellers'
failure to pay, perform or discharge in accordance with its terms any Retained
Liability.

          (b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold Sellers and their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, employees and Affiliates harmless from and
against all Damages resulting from (i) Buyer's breach of any representation or
warranty made by it in or pursuant to in this Agreement, (ii) Buyer's failure to
perform or breach of any covenant made by it in or pursuant to this Agreement,
(iii) Buyer's failure to pay, perform or discharge in accordance with its terms
any of the Assumed Liabilities, or (iv) all Liabilities arising under any
Environmental, Health or Safety Requirements or with respect to Environmental
Claims or Environmental Costs arising from Environmental Conditions at the Real
Property, irrespective of whether such Liability attaches or accrues to Buyer or
Sellers in the first instance, but not including any Retained Liability.

          (c) The Buyer expressly releases and discharges Seller, its successors
and assigns, from all claims, demands, actions, judgments and executions for the
indemnified matters set forth in Section 10.2(b)(iv).

     10.3 Indemnification Amounts.

          (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Sellers will not be obligated to indemnify Buyer for any Damages
resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty made by Sellers:


                                       44               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

               (i) to the extent that Damages arising from any individual claim
     for indemnification are $10,000 or less (the "Buyer Minimum Claim Amount");

               (ii) unless and until the amount of all such Damages (other than
     those for claims that do not satisfy the Buyer Minimum Claim Amount)
     exceeds $1,300,000 (the "Buyer Deductible"), and then only for the amount
     of the Damages in excess of the Buyer Deductible; provided, however, that
     the Buyer Deductible shall not apply to any Damages resulting from a breach
     of a representation or warranty made by Sellers pursuant to Section 5.19
     (Environmental Matters); and

               (iii) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such
     payments for Damages (other than those for claims that do not satisfy the
     Buyer Minimum Claim Amount) to Buyer exceeds an amount equal to sixty-five
     percent (65%) of the amount of the Purchase Price paid in cash.

          (b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Buyer will not be obligated to indemnify Sellers for any Damages
resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty made by Buyer:

               (i) to the extent that the Damages arising from any individual
     claim for indemnification are $10,000 or less; and

               (ii) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all such payments
     for Damages to Sellers exceeds the aggregate amount of the Purchase Price
     paid in the form of the Seller Shares, as calculated on the basis of the
     Price Per Share and after giving effect to any adjustments to the Purchase
     Price under Section 3.3.

          (c) For purposes of this Article X, a representation or warranty shall
be deemed breached if it would have been breached had the representation not
been qualified by the words "material", "materiality", "Material Adverse
Effect", "in all material respects", or words of similar import.

     10.4 Claims.

          (a) If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification pursuant
to this Article X, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such claim describing such claim in reasonable detail;
provided that the failure to provide such notice will not affect the obligations
of the Indemnifying Party unless it is actually prejudiced thereby. If the claim
for indemnification does not involve a claim by a third party then the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted liability for the Damages
arising from such claim (subject to the limitations set forth in this Article)
unless the Indemnifying Party delivers a written objection to the Indemnified
Party within 30 days after receiving the notice of claim. If such claim involves
a claim by a third party against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
will have thirty days after receipt of such notice to elect to undertake,
conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense,
the settlement or defense thereof, and if it so elects, the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided that the Indemnified
Party may participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen and
paid for by such Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying


                                       45               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or
compromise any action in any manner or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to the matter unless the sole relief granted is the payment of money by
the Indemnifying Party and the plaintiff or claimant releases the Indemnified
Party from all liability. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty days after the receipt of the Indemnified
Party's notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the
defense thereof, or if the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense but
thereafter fails to pursue such defense actively, then the Indemnified Party
will have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. As
long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting any such claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party has the right to pay or settle any such claim;
provided that as long as the Indemnifying Party is contesting such claim in good
faith, any such settlement is to include as an unconditional term thereof the
delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnifying Party of a duly
executed written release of the Indemnifying Party from all liability and
obligation in respect of such action; and provided further that in such event,
unless the Indemnifying Party has consented to such payment or settlement, the
Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the
Indemnifying Party; and provided further that the Indemnified Party shall
provide the Indemnifying Party reasonable advance notice of any proposed
settlement or payment.

          (b) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in all aspects of any
investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or
discharge of any claim in respect of which indemnity is sought pursuant to this
Article X, including, but not limited to, by providing the other party with
reasonable access to employees and officers (including as witnesses) and other
information. The Indemnified Party's actual costs and expenses of providing such
cooperation shall constitute a part of its Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification in accordance with this Article X.

     10.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except with respect to the availability of equitable
relief or actual fraud, the indemnification provisions of this Article X are the
exclusive remedy following the Closing for any breaches or alleged breaches of
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, without limitation of the
foregoing, Buyer and each Seller hereby waives any and all rights that are or
may otherwise be available to it at law or equity in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any claim pursuant to the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
42 U.S.C. 'SS'SS'9601 et seq.; and none of the Parties, nor any of its Related
Persons, may bring any action or proceeding, at law, equity or otherwise,
against any other party or its Related Persons, in respect of any breaches or
alleged breaches of any representation, warranty or other provision of this
Agreement, except pursuant to the express provisions of this Article X. The
Parties hereby acknowledge that no Party has made any representations and
warranties, express or implied, with respect to this Agreement or the matters
contemplated hereby, except as explicitly set forth in or made pursuant to this
Agreement. The Parties also acknowledge that this Section 10.5 is not intended
to restrict the rights of either party arising from and after the Closing Date
under the Ancillary Agreements.

<PAGE>

     10.6 Tax and Insurance. The amount of any Damages suffered by an
Indemnified Party is to be reduced by any net federal Tax, insurance or other
benefits that such party receives in respect of or as a result of such Damages
or the facts or circumstances relating thereto. A 34% tax rate is to be used in
computing any such reduction for net federal Tax benefits. If any Damages for
which indemnification is provided hereunder are subsequently reduced by any net
tax benefit, insurance payment or other recovery from a third party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly remit the amount of such reduction to the
Indemnifying Party.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     11.1 Employment. Buyer shall make offers of employment to, and employ for a
period of not less than two months after the Closing Date, on the terms required
by this Article XI, all individuals who are employed in the EMG Business
immediately prior to the Closing Date and who accept such offers of employment,
including, to the extent set forth in Section 11.5, those individuals who are on
lay-off, leave of absence, disability leave or elect to retire immediately prior
to the Closing Date (collectively, those employees who accept employment with
Buyer as of the Closing Date shall collectively be referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees"); provided that, (a) except as otherwise required by the
Employee Retention Incentive Agreements, Buyer will not be required to continue
to employ any Transferred Employee who resigns or otherwise voluntarily
terminates his employment by Buyer or who is terminated by Buyer for cause, (b)
Buyer shall not make offers of employment to the individuals identified on
Schedule 11.1 whom Sellers desire to retain after the Closing Date and such
individuals shall not be considered "Transferred Employees".

     11.2 Compensation and Employee Benefits.

          (a) In General. Buyer shall provide each Transferred Employee, so long
as he or she otherwise remains employed by Buyer, with compensation, employee
benefits and severance programs that, in the aggregate, are substantially
equivalent to those provided by Buyer immediately prior to the Closing Date to
Buyer's employees serving in comparable capacities and with comparable years of
service. Subject to the foregoing, the other provisions of this Article XI and
the provisions of the Employee Retention Incentive Agreements, Buyer shall have
the right to determine the compensation and employee benefits of the Transferred
Employees.

          (b) Severance Payments. Buyer and Sellers will be obligated for
severance payments to Transferred Employees as provided in the Reimbursement
Agreement except that Exhibit III of that letter shall be amended as set forth
on Schedule 11.2(b). Sellers shall be liable for and shall pay all eligible
individuals employed by the EMG Business prior to the Closing severance benefits
in accordance with the terms of Seller's severance policies; provided, however,
that nothing in this Agreement should be construed to obligate Sellers to pay
severance to any Transferred Employee or any employee of the EMG Business who is
made an offer of employment by Buyer , except as provided in the Reimbursement
Agreement. Seller shall also reimburse Buyer for all severance costs incurred by
Buyer, up to an aggregate cumulative amount of $400,000, in connection with any
Transferred Employee who was an

<PAGE>

employee of Sellers' RAM Division on the Closing Date who is terminated by Buyer
within six months after the Closing Date because of the closing or relocation of
the operations of the RAM Division.

          (c) Service Credit. For purposes of any employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement established for or made available to Transferred Employees by
Buyer (the "Buyer Plans"), other than Buyer's post-retirement medical benefit
plan, Buyer shall credit such Transferred Employees with service for all periods
of service prior to the Closing Date with Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers.
Such service will be credited for purposes of determining eligibility for,
vesting in and the amount of benefits under all of the Buyer Plans and for all
other purposes for which service is either taken into account or recognized;
provided, however, that such service need not be credited to the extent it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits.

          (d) Welfare Benefit Plans. Coverage for all Transferred Employees and
their respective dependents under the Seller ERISA Plans and Seller Benefit
Arrangements that are welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1)
of ERISA (the "Seller Welfare Plans"), will terminate effective as of the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date. All Liabilities of Sellers under the
Seller Welfare Plans prior to the effective date of such termination shall be
Retained Liabilities. The Buyer Plans that are welfare benefit plans within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (the "Buyer Welfare Plans") shall provide
coverage and benefits to Transferred Employees (and the eligible dependents of
the Transferred Employees) beginning on the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause
deductibles and out-of-pocket payments expended for coverage under the Seller
Welfare Plans in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to be counted
toward the deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums applicable to each Transferred
Employee under the Buyer Welfare Plans. Sellers will provide Buyer, at Buyer's
expense, with electronic or other copies of existing records regarding each
Transferred Employee's status regarding deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses
under the Seller Welfare Plans (it being understood that Sellers will not be
required to generate any reports or provide any other information that it did
not produce or maintain in the Ordinary Course of Business). In addition, no
pre-existing condition, limitation, exclusion or waiting period applicable with
respect to any Buyer Welfare Plan will apply to any Transferred Employee.

          (e) Savings and Pension Plans.

               (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, Sellers will cause all
     Transferred Employees to become fully vested in their account balances
     under the Dana Corporation Employee Incentive and Savings Investment Plan
     (the "Savings Plan") and their accrued benefits under the Pension Plan for
     Dana Automotive Aftermarket Group Employees (the "Pension Plan"). All
     Liabilities of Sellers under the Savings Plan and the Pension Plan shall be
     Retained Liabilities.

               (ii) With respect to each Transferred Employee who has an
     outstanding loan under the Savings Plan, Buyer and Sellers shall take such
     action as shall be necessary to permit such Transferred Employee to
     rollover such loan to the applicable Buyer Plan.

<PAGE>

     11.3 COBRA; Retiree Medical Benefits. Buyer shall have sole responsibility
for "continuation coverage" benefits provided after the Closing Date under
Buyer's group health plans to all Transferred Employees, and "qualified
beneficiaries" of Transferred Employees, for whom a "qualifying event" occurs on
or after the Closing Date. Sellers shall have the sole responsibility for
"continuation coverage" benefits provided under Sellers' group health plans to
all employees of Sellers, and "qualified beneficiaries" of employees of Sellers,
for whom a "qualifying event" has occurred prior to the Closing Date, or for any
such individual who is not a Transferred Employee or "qualified beneficiary"
with respect to a Transferred Employee, regardless of when such "qualifying
event" occurs, and the obligations of Sellers under this sentence shall be
Retained Liabilities. The terms "continuation coverage," "qualified
beneficiaries" and "qualifying event" shall have the meaning ascribed to them
under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601-608 of ERISA.

     11.4 WARN Act. Buyer shall not engage in a "mass layoff" or "plant closing"
as defined in the United States Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act (the "WARN Act") affecting the Transferred Employees without complying with
the WARN Act. Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their
Related Persons from any claims, charges, suits, demands, damage, or liability
arising out of or relating to any such noncompliance with the WARN Act from and
after the Closing Date.

     11.5 Non-Active Employees. Except as expressly provided below, Buyer shall
make offers of employment to, and shall employ to the extent such offers are
accepted, the individuals employed in the EMG Business who are on non-active
status on the Closing Date due to lay-off, leave of absence or disability (the
"Non-Active Employees"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall retain as
their employees any Non-Active Employees listed on Schedule 11.5 who are on
long-term disability leave on the Closing Date and any other Non-Active
Employees who are on long-term disability leave on the Closing Date, up to a
maximum of sixteen (16) such employees. In consideration of Seller's agreement
to retain such employees, Buyer shall pay to Sellers, on the Closing Date and
subject to the contemporaneous consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Dana.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   TERMINATION

     12.1 Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:

          (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Dana;

          (b) by Buyer, if a Seller has committed a material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers in this Agreement and such
breach is either not capable of being cured or if such Seller has failed to cure
such breach within 30 days after written notice thereof from Buyer;


                                       49               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

          (c) by Dana, if Buyer has committed a material breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer in this Agreement and such breach
is either not capable of being cured or if Buyer has failed to cure such breach
within 30 days after written notice thereof from Dana;

          (d) by Buyer or Dana, upon written notice to the other, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or
prior to the Outside Termination Date, because the conditions precedent to the
terminating party's obligations to consummate the transactions hereunder set
forth in Article IX have not been met by such date, unless such failure of
consummation is due to the failure of the Party seeking such termination to
perform or observe in all material respects the covenants and agreements hereof
to be performed or observed by such Party;

          (e) by Dana, upon written notice to Buyer, if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have not been consummated on or prior to the
Outside Termination Date as a result of the failure of Buyer to satisfy the
condition in Section 9.3(d) (unless such failure results from Sellers' breach of
Section 7.24); or

          (f) by Buyer or Dana, upon written notice to the other Party, if a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an Order enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and such Order has become final and non-appealable; provided,
however, that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
clause (f) has used its commercially reasonable efforts to remove such Order.

     12.2 Effect of Termination.

          (a) The termination of this Agreement is to be effected by delivery of
written notice of such termination by the Party terminating the Agreement to the
other Party. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
12.1, no Party will have any Liability or any further obligation to any other
Party (except for any Liability of any Party then in breach and as provided in
Section 12.2(b) or Section 12.2(c)).

          (b) Buyer shall pay to Dana the sum of $6,000,000 in the event that:

               (i) Dana terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c);

Schedules and the exhibits and appendices hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements,
together with the Reimbursement Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement,
contain the complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreements
between the Parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
Parties with respect thereto.

     13.6 Captions; References. The name of this Agreement and the captions
contained herein are for convenience of reference only and do not affect the
interpretation or construction hereof. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a clause, a Section or an Article, such reference will be to a
clause, a Section or Article of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

     13.7 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written
agreement referencing this Agreement and duly executed by the Parties.

     13.8 Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the Parties may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto
to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a writing
signed on behalf of such Party. No waiver by any Party of any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or
affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any such prior or subsequent
occurrence.

     13.9 Governing Law. This Agreement is to be governed by, and construed and
enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Ohio, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Ohio or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the State of Ohio.

     13.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision is to be interpreted
to be only so broad as is enforceable.

     13.11 Updated Disclosure Schedules. Until five (5) days prior to Closing,
Sellers may deliver to Buyer amended versions of the Schedules required or
permitted by this Agreement to the extent required to reflect developments in or
effecting the EMG Business and its assets or liabilities which occur from and
after the date of this Agreement (such developments, together with any
information of which Sellers notify Buyer pursuant to the last sentence of
Section 7.2,


                                       53               Asset Purchase Agreement




<PAGE>

being collectively referred to as "New Facts"). If any amendment made pursuant
to this Section 13.11 discloses New Facts which result from the conduct of the
EMG Business as permitted by Sections 7.1 or 7.2 of this Agreement, or which is
an event that is deemed not to have a Material Adverse Effect pursuant to the
proviso to the definition of such term, then without any further action by Buyer
the Schedules, as so amended, will be deemed to have amended for all purposes of
this Agreement, including Section 9.3(a) and Section 10.2(a). If any amendment
delivered by Sellers pursuant to this Section 13.11 discloses New Facts other
than those described in the preceding sentence, then the Schedules will be
deemed to have been amended for the purposes of this Agreement only if and to
the extent Buyer approves such amendment in writing.

     13.12 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties submits to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the County
of New York, New York and the County of Lucas, Ohio in any Action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of such
Action may be heard and determined in any such court. Each of the Parties waives
any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought. Any Party may make service on the other Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address and in
the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 13.4 above. Nothing in
this Section 13.12, however, shall affect the right of any Party to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other
court or to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law or in
equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding so
brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in
any other manner provided by law or in equity.

     13.13 Construction. This Agreement is the result of the joint efforts of
Buyer and Sellers, and each provision hereof has been subject to the mutual
consultation, negotiation and agreement of the Parties and there is to be no
construction against either Party based on any presumption of that Party's
involvement in the drafting thereof. Any reference to any federal, state, local,
or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The
word "including" shall mean including without limitation. Whenever the context
so requires or permits, all references to the masculine herein shall include the
feminine and neuter, all references to the neuter herein shall include the
masculine and feminine, all references to the plural shall include the singular
and all references to the singular shall include the plural. Nothing in the
Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein unless the applicable Disclosure Schedule
or a document attached thereto fairly discloses the exception. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a
document or other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to
a representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty
has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself). The Parties
intend that each representation, warranty, and covenant contained herein shall
have independent significance. If any Party has breached any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact there exists
another representation, warranty, or covenant relating to the same subject
matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) that the Party has not
breached will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach
of the first representation, warranty, or covenant.
