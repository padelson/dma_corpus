 SECTION 3.15. _Intellectual Property_. 

   

 (a) _Generally_. Section 3.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate and complete list of all registered Intellectual Property, all applications for registration of Intellectual Property, all material unregistered Trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in whole or in part, including jointly with others (such schedule specifies if such Intellectual Property is owned jointly), that is necessary to operate the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted. The technology disclosed by the provisional patent applications (the " _Provisional Patent Applications_ ") listed in Section 3.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule is not (i) necessary to operate the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted or (ii) used in or in connection with any of the products or services currently offered by the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Intellectual Property owned by, or licensed under the Inbound License Agreements to, the Company and its Subsidiaries constitute all the material Intellectual Property rights necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it is currently conducted, including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property rights currently used or held for use in connection with services provided to the customers identified on Section 3.25 of the Disclosure Schedule. No registered Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been or is now 

    ##### 

  

 

involved in any interference, reissue, reexamination, opposition, cancellation
or similar proceeding and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such action is
or has been threatened with respect to any of the registered Intellectual
Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The registered
Intellectual Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries is valid and
subsisting and, to the Knowledge of the Company, enforceable, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim
challenging or questioning the validity or enforceability or alleging the
misuse of any of the registered Intellectual Property of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken
any action or failed to take any action, which action or failure reasonably
could be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture,
relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of any of the registered
Intellectual Property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries own exclusively all right, title and interest to the Intellectual Property used by the Company and its Subsidiaries that is not licensed to them pursuant to a written license agreement (including electronic writing), free and clear of any Encumbrance except as set forth in Section 3.15(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, or other adverse claims or interests, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim challenging their ownership of any of such Intellectual Property. The Company has received valid, effective and enforceable written assignments from each of the inventors of any invention claimed or disclosed in any of the pending patent applications set forth on Section 3.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, including, but not limited to, the Provisional Patent Applications, of all right, title and interest in the inventions disclosed or claimed by such applications. None of such Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, or stipulation restricting the use thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have valid and enforceable licenses to use the Intellectual Property used by the Company and its Subsidiaries that is not owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (c) _Trademarks_. 

    

 (i) Except as described in Section 3.15(c)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, all Trademarks of the Company and its Subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all legal requirements (including the timely post-registration filing of affidavits of use and incontestability and renewal applications) other than any requirement that, if not satisfied, would not result in a cancellation of any such registration or otherwise affect the priority and enforceability of the Trademark in question. 

   

 (ii) To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no prior use of any Trademark by any third party that confers upon said third party superior rights in any such Trademark. 

   

 (iii) All Trademarks of the Company and its Subsidiaries registered in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction, and for which applications to register have been filed in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction which are being used, have been continuously used in the form appearing in, and in connection with, the goods and 

   #####

 (d) _Patents_.

 (e) _Copyrights_. Except as may be set forth in Section 3.15(e) of the Disclosure Schedule: 

    

 (i) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries is the owner of all right, title and interest in and to each of the Copyrights used by the Company and its Subsidiaries other than those as to which the rights being exercised by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been licensed from another Person (collectively, " _Owned Copyrights_ "), free and clear of any and all Encumbrances, covenants, conditions and restrictions or to the Knowledge of the Company, other adverse claims or interests of any kind or nature, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim (whether written or oral) challenging their complete and exclusive ownership of the Owned Copyrights or suggesting that any other Person has any claim of legal or beneficial ownership with respect thereto. 

   

 (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim (whether written or oral) challenging or questioning the validity or enforceability of any of the Owned Copyrights or indicating an intention on the part of any Person to bring a claim that any Owned Copyright is invalid, is unenforceable or has been misused and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Owned Copyright otherwise has been challenged or threatened in any way. 

   

 (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or, to the Knowledge of the Company, failed to take any action (including a failure to disclose required information to the United States Copyright Office or other Governmental Entity in connection with any registration of a registered copyright therewith), or used or enforced (or failed to use or enforce) any of the Owned Copyrights, in each case in a manner that would result in the unenforceability of any of the Owned Copyrights. 

   

 (iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any Person any right, license or permission to exercise any rights under any of the Owned 

   ##### 

  

    

Copyrights other than non-exclusive licenses of Software granted in the
Ordinary Course of Business to customers. 

   

 (v) To the Knowledge of the Company, no other Person has infringed or is infringing in any material respect any of the Owned Copyrights. 

  

 (f) _Trade Secrets_. The Company and its Subsidiaries enforce a policy of requiring each employee, consultant and contractor to execute proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment agreements substantially in the Companys standard forms that assign to the Company all rights to any Intellectual Property rights relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are developed by any consultant or contractor, as applicable, for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that are developed by an employee, and that, to the Companys Knowledge, otherwise appropriately protect the Intellectual Property of the Company or any one of its Subsidiaries, and, except under confidentiality obligations, there has been no disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of their material Trade Secrets, _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent necessary to perfect the Companys or its Subsidiaries rights in their Intellectual Property, all such assignments from consultants or contractors have been duly executed and filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office and other appropriate Governmental Entities, and all such assignments from employees relating to inventions with respect to which the Company has filed patent applications have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other appropriate Governmental Entities. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of all information that constitutes or at the relevant time constituted a Trade Secret of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, no employee, independent contractor or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated under any agreement (including licenses, covenants or commitments of any nature) or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative agency, or is subject to any other restriction that would interfere with the use of his or her best efforts to carry out his or her duties for the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or to promote the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries or that would conflict with the business as presently conducted of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The carrying on of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries by the employees, independent contractors and consultants of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the conduct of their business as presently conducted, will not, to the Knowledge of the Company, conflict with or result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any contract, covenant or instrument under which any of such employees, independent contractors or consultants or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is now obligated. 

   

 (g) _License Agreements_. Section 3.15(g)(1) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of all license agreements granting to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any right to use or practice any rights under any Intellectual Property other than COTS Software (collectively, the " _Inbound License Agreements_ "), indicating for each the title and the parties thereto, and an explanation of the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys use of the Intellectual Property that is the subject of such Inbound License Agreement (if any).

The Company has no actual knowledge of any prior art or other published description of technology that anticipates the technology disclosed by any of the Provisional Patent Applications or would render such technology obvious to one of ordinary skill in the relevant art that predates the filing date of the Provisional Patent Applications or would otherwise reasonably be expected to undermine the patentability of such technology.

No litigation is now or, within the three years prior to the date of this Agreement, was pending and no notice or other claim in writing has been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within one year prior to the date of this Agreement, (A) alleging that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any activity or conduct that infringes upon, violates or constitutes the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any third party or (B) challenging the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any Intellectual Property owned or exclusively licensed by or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Intellectual Property that is owned or licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject (with respect to the Intellectual Property licensed to the Company  only to the Knowledge of the Company) to any outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement restricting the use thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, in the case of Intellectual Property licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to others, restricting the sale, transfer, assignment or licensing thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any person.

 (l) _Assignment; Change of Control_. Except as set forth in Section 3.15(l) of the Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will not result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any right of any   ##### 

  

  

  

third party to terminate, any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries rights to

Agreement or Outbound License Agreement, nor require the consent of any

 Except as disclosed in Section 3.15(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no software products of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contain any code that is owned by any third party, including any code that is licensed pursuant to the provisions of any "open source" license agreement, including without limitation GNUs General Public License or Lesser/Library GPL, or any other license agreement that requires source code be distributed or made available in connection with the distribution of the licensed software in object code form or that limits the amount of fees that may be charged in connection with sublicensing or distributing such licensed software (each, an " _Open Source License_ ").

The indemnity obligations of this Section 5.13 shall not apply to (x) any Taxes that were included in the Most Recent Balance Sheet as a "current liability" or the subject of a reserve for Taxes; (y) other than any Taxes that result directly or indirectly from filing the Section 5.13 Tax Return as provided in Section 5.13(c), any Taxes that result directly or indirectly from any action or omission of the Company after the Closing that is not in accordance with past practice or required by Applicable Law which has the effect of creating or increasing Taxes for any period prior to Closing and (z) any cancellation or denial of use of loss carryforwards. Except as set forth herein, Parent and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 5.13(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) to the extent that claims are made by Parent and its Affiliates with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Equityholders under Section 5.13(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) following the date that is 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Parent and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 5.13(a) for Losses arising from a breach of Section 3.14 to the extent that Parent or   ##### 

  

  

  

its Affiliates, as applicable, have actually recovered any amounts in respect
of such Losses under Section 8.2. 

   

 (c) For purposes of this Section 5.13, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one that ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other that began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment factors of the Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were closed at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes, such as real and personal property taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on the basis of the number of elapsed days in each such period. 

   

 (d) (i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed, within the time and manner prescribed by law, all Tax Returns of the Company that are required to be filed prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and prior to filing, such Tax Returns shall be submitted to Parent no later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (including any applicable extensions) for Parents review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). Parent shall file or cause to be filed when due all Tax Returns of the Company for Taxable periods or events beginning before the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Except as provided below with respect to Section 5.13 Tax Return, such Tax Returns shall be submitted to the Holder Representatives no later than 30 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (including any applicable extensions) for the Holder Representatives review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Holder Representatives and Parent shall consult with each other and Parent shall consider in good faith all comments, issues and objections raised by the Holder Representatives. Subject to Section 5.13(d)(ii) below, in the event of a dispute between Parent and the Holder Representatives with respect to the applicability of the requirement to file or amend any Tax Return for which an indemnification obligation under this Section 5.13 may arise, or with respect to any information to be included therein, Parent and the Holder Representatives shall resolve such dispute in the manner set forth in Section 8.4. 

   

 (ii) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing Section 5.13(d)(i), Parent may cause the Surviving Company to file, if not filed by the Company prior to Closing, the Tax Returns of the Company set forth Section 5.13 of the Disclosure Schedule (such Tax Returns, the " _Section 5.13 Tax Return_"). Copies of the Section 5.13 Tax Return shall be submitted to the Holder Representative no later than 30 days prior to the date Parent intends to cause the Surviving Company to file such tax Returns for the Holder Representatives review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Holder Representatives and Parent shall consult with each other regarding the Section 5.13 Tax Return and Parent shall consider in good faith all comments, issues and objections raised by either of the Holder Representatives. In the event of a dispute between Parent and the Holder Representatives   ##### 

  

  

  

with respect to any information to be included in a Section 5.13 Tax Return
for which an indemnification obligation under this Section 5.13 may arise,
Parent and the Holder Representatives shall resolve such dispute in the
manner set forth in Section 8.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Holder Representatives shall not have the ability to dispute the
applicability of the requirement to file a Section 5.13 Tax Return. 

   

 (iii) Subject to 5.13(d)(ii), the fact that a Tax Return for which an indemnification obligation under this Section 5.13 may arise has been filed or inclusion of any information in such Tax Return shall not, by itself, be deemed to impose an indemnification obligation on the Equityholders with respect thereto under this Section 5.13 or restrict the Holder Representatives ability to claim that such filing was not required under Applicable Law and that no indemnification obligation arises with respect thereto. 

   

 (e) Parent, the Holder Representatives and the Company shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees reasonably to cooperate, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods or relating to Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes. 

   

 (f) If a claim for Taxes, including, without limitation, notice of a pending or threatened audit, shall be made by any Taxing Authority to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in writing, which, if successful, could result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 5.13(a) or Article VIII (a " _Tax Claim_ "), Parent shall notify the Holder Representatives in writing of the Tax Claim within ten (10) Business Days following Parents or its Subsidiarys receipt of the written claim for Taxes.

 (h) In the case of any taxable period that commences after the Closing Date, Parent shall have the sole right to represent the interests of the Company with respect to any Tax Claim (a " _Post-Closing Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Post-Closing Tax Claim could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the Equityholders by virtue of their   #####

Parent may not agree to any settlement, compromise or closing or other agreement with respect to any Tax Claim relating to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period which ends immediately after the close of business on the Closing Date that could reasonably be expected to give rise to indemnification obligations under Section 5.13(a) or Article VIII or otherwise materially adversely affect the Equityholders by virtue of their indemnification obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the Holder Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

In addition, to the extent that a claim for refund or a proceeding for a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date results in a payment or credit against Taxes by a Taxing Authority to the Company or Parent, of any amount accrued on the Most Recent Balance Sheet, Parent shall pay the net amount of such refund, payment or credit after reduction for all Tax costs, fees or expenses incurred by the Company or Parent, as a result of or in obtaining such refund, payment or credit to the Equityholders within 30 Business Days after receipt or entitlement thereto. Payments to the Equityholders pursuant to this Section 5.13(j) shall be distributed among the Equityholders in accordance with the Companys Charter Documents as determined by either of the Holder Representatives in its sole discretion.

IX shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 7.3. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Holder Representative but no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of the Companys stockholders under applicable law without such approval.

Any agreement on the part of any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument, in writing, signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 (ii) The Cap shall not apply to any claims for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

   

 (iii) The Cap shall not apply to any claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or 3.14, _provided_ , _however_ , that no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification for any Losses arising under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, or 3.4 to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Losses paid to Parent Indemnitees, under Section 8.2(a)(i) exceeds the total Merger Consideration actually paid to the Equityholders hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article VIII for Losses arising under Section 3.14 and under Sections 5.13(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) to the extent that the aggregate amount of all Losses paid to Parent Indemnitees under Section 8.2(a)(i) and Sections 5.13(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) exceeds $100 million. 

   

 (iv) Subject to Section 8.2(d)(i) and Section 8.2(d)(ii), in the event that a Parent Indemnitee seeks indemnification for Losses against any Equityholder outside of the escrow in accordance with Section 5.13 or Article VIII, each Equityholders aggregate liability with respect to such Loss shall not exceed an amount equal to its pro-rata portion of such Loss, based on the percentage of cash consideration such Equityholder received with respect to its shares of Common Stock, of Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants in relation to the total amount of cash consideration paid with respect to all of the shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Options and Warrants, in each case pursuant to Section 2.8 (such percentage, the " _Pro-Rata Portion_ "). Subject to Section 8.2(d)(i) and (ii), notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the liability of each Equityholder for indemnification under this Article VIII and under Sections 5.13(a)(i), 

   ##### 

  

   

(ii) and (iii) shall under no circumstances exceed the amount of merger
consideration actually paid to such Equityholder hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this section 8.2(d)(iv) shall not
apply to any Equityholders obligations under Section 5.13(a)(iv). 

  

 (e) _Offsets to Losses_. For all purposes of this Article VIII, Losses shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee under any insurance policies in effect prior to the Closing in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (net of any deductible amounts and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection therewith, including, without limitation, retrospective and prospective premium adjustments and experience-based premium adjustments) and (ii) any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses in the year in which such Losses were incurred. In computing the amount of any Tax benefit the Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.2 for Losses arising from a breach of Section 3.14 to the extent that Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, have actually recovered any amounts in respect of such Losses under Section 5.13. 

   

 (f) _Tax Provisions_. Except as set forth in Section 5.13(k), the indemnification provisions of this Article VIII shall not apply to the indemnification obligations of the Equityholders or Parent as set forth in Section 5.13. All such obligations shall be governed by the terms of Section 5.13. 

   

 8.3. _Manner of Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Claims of indemnification made under this Article VIII (an " _Indemnification Claim_ ") may be made only in accordance with the provisions of this Article VIII and, as applicable, the Escrow Agreement. To provide a fund against which a Parent Indemnitee may first assert an Indemnification Claim, the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent in accordance with Section 2.8(a). The amounts held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be held for a period of time expiring on the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, unless an Indemnification Claim has been received by the Holder Representatives from a Parent Indemnitee prior to such time in accordance with the terms hereof, in which case an amount equal to the Losses claimed in such Certificate or Certificates shall be held until the resolution of any and all such claims in accordance with the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement. The Parent Indemnitees shall first look to the Indemnity Escrow Amount for the satisfaction of any claims for indemnification they may have under Sections 8.2(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this Agreement before proceeding against the Equityholders. The liability for indemnification of claims under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(a)(iv) arising from a breach of or inaccuracy in the representations in Section 3.4 (Capitalization) that relate only to particular Equityholders shall be borne only by such Equityholders. 

   

 (b) In the event an Indemnification Claim arises and the amount of Loss in respect thereof has not yet been determined, a good faith reasonable estimate of such Loss shall be made by the Parent Indemnitee and the corresponding portion of the Indemnity Escrow   ##### 

  

  

  

Amount shall be retained until the amount of Loss has been determined, and
shall then be applied or distributed as provided for in the Escrow
Agreement. 

   

 8.4. _Notice of Claims_. 

   

 (a) Any Indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder shall give a notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from whom indemnification is sought (either a Holder Representative (in the case of a Parent Indemnitee) or Parent (in the case of a Seller Indemnitee), the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), specifying in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any Indemnification Claim and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such Indemnification Claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any agreement, certificate or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection herewith upon which such Indemnification Claim is based; _provided_ , that a Claim Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after the action or suit is commenced; and  _provided further_ , that failure to give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto to provide such Indemnitee with notice that it disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice (the " _Disagreement Notice_ "). If a timely Disagreement Notice is not received or to the extent an item is not objected to in the Disagreement Notice, the Claim Notice shall be deemed to have been accepted and final and binding on the parties, absent manifest error. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a timely Disagreement Notice, the parties shall resolve such conflict in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.4(c). 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall have provided a Disagreement Notice, the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by Parent and either of the Holder Representatives. In the event the parties shall fail to reach an agreement within 30 days after the date on which the Indemnifying Party provided a Disagreement Notice, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Article IX. 

   

 8.5. _Third-Party Claims_. If a Parent Indemnitee becomes aware of a third-party claim that such Parent Indemnitee believes, in good faith, may result in a demand by it for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, such Parent Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Holder Representatives in writing of such claim, setting forth such claim in reasonable detail. The Indemnifying Party shall have 10 days (the "Notice Period") after receipt of such notice to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the Indemnifying Partys obligation to indemnify with respect to such third-party claim and desires to undertake the conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such action only to the extent (i) such claim would not reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses that are more than   ##### 

  

  

  

the amount of the funds then remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (when
taking into account any other pending claims on the funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account) or (ii) the claim does not seek an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnitee; and _provided further_ , that, if it elects to
assume control of such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
continue to maintain control of that claim so long as it conducts the defense
of the claim actively and diligently. The Indemnitee is hereby authorized
(but not obligated), prior to and during the Notice Period, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to file any motion, answer or other
pleading and to take any other action which the Indemnitee shall, based on
the opinion of its counsel (which may be in-house counsel), deem necessary or
advisable to protect the Indemnitees interests and shall provide an advance
notice to the Indemnifying Party thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of the defense of such claim, the Indemnitee may participate in such
settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnitee and paid at
its own expense; _provided_ that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for
such Indemnitee, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel to such Indemnitee in connection with such defense. So long as the
Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the
Indemnitee shall not pay or settle any such claim without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnitee
within 10 days after receipt of the Indemnitees notice of a claim of
indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof (or the
Indemnifying Party is otherwise unable to assume control of the defense
pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.5), the Indemnitee shall have the
right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Partys cost, risk and expense, the
defense, compromise or settlement of the claim, but shall not thereby waive
any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnitee, enter into any
settlement that (a) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the Person or Persons asserting such claim to all Indemnitees of an
unconditional release from all Liability with respect to such claim or
consent to entry of any judgment and (b) involves non-monetary relief or
remedy, including any restrictions on the Indemnitees ability to operate
or compete. 

   

 8.6. _Mitigation; Exclusivity of Remedy_. 

   

 (a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except in the case of fraud or willful misconduct, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Sections 5.13, 8.2 and 8.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Equityholders for any breach by the other parties of the representations and warranties in this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their respective terms or are otherwise breached, the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms thereof in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Each party hereto shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any Losses. 

   

 (b) No investigation conducted by or on behalf of any party at any time and no disclosure provided to, or knowledge of, any party with respect to any event, condition or circumstance that renders inaccurate any representation or warranty or reveals the occurrence of a breach of any covenant of any other party contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of, or to relieve such other party of any liability for, (i) the breach of any such   ##### 

  

  

  

representation, warranty or covenant or (ii) any rights to indemnification or
other remedy arising in connection therewith. Parent hereby expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy for any Losses arising
out of or relating to any such breach notwithstanding any investigation,
disclosure or knowledge as described herein. 

   

 8.7. _Holder Representative_. 

   

 (a) In order to efficiently administer the defense and/or settlement of any claims for indemnity by a Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII or Section 5.13, Carmel V.C. Ltd. and Sequoia Seed Capital II (Israel) L.P., as the Holder Representatives, are each hereby appointed to serve as a representative of the Equityholders. Each Holder Representative shall, alone, have full power and authority to make all decisions relating to the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which any Parent Indemnitee may claim to be entitled to indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII or Section 5.13, all decisions and actions relating to the distribution of any portion of the Option Escrow Fund forfeited by holders of Unvested, In-the-Money Options and otherwise to act on behalf of the Equityholders in all respects with respect to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the amendment or termination of such agreements except that (i) in making any decision relating to the defense and/or settlement of any claims for which any Parent Indemnitee may claim to be entitled to indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII or Section 5.13 that relate to a particular Equityholder, such decision shall require the prior consent of such particular Equityholder, (ii) any amendment that affects the rights of a particular Equityholder in a manner different than the other Equityholders shall require the consent of such Equityholder, and (iii) any amendment that changes the economic terms and conditions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreements shall require the approval of the Majority Equityholders, as defined below, and any other approval required in accordance with Applicable Law. All decisions and actions by any Holder Representative shall be binding upon all of the Equityholders, and no Equityholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation, bankruptcy, dissolution or winding-up of any Holder Representative, the Equityholders beneficially owning (or which, prior to the Effective Time, beneficially owned) a majority of the shares (or share-equivalents) (based upon the Fully Diluted Number) owned by all such Equityholders (the " _Majority Equityholders_ ") may, and in the event of the death, incapacity, resignation bankruptcy, dissolution or winding-up of both of the Holder Representatives, the Majority Equityholders shall promptly appoint a substitute Holder Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall both the Holder Representatives resign without the Majority Equityholders having first appointed at least one substitute Holder Representative who shall assume such duties immediately upon the resignation of both Holder Representatives and, provided, further, that in the event of the death, incapacity or resignation of either Carmel V.C. Ltd. or Sequoia Seed Capital II (Israel) L.P as a Holder Representative, another Person reasonably acceptable to Parent shall be appointed as the Holder Representative hereunder. 

   

 (b) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to object to, protest or otherwise contest any matter related to the procedures for action being taken by a Holder Representative as between such Holder Representative and the Equityholders. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby waive any claims they may have or assert, including those that may arise in the future, against any Holder   ##### 

  

  

  

Representative or any of its Affiliates that relate to such Holder
Representatives role as such, including any claims for any action or
inaction taken or not taken by such Holder Representative in connection
herewith, except claims for fraud or claims based on actions taken or not
taken by such Holder Representative in bad faith. 

   

 (c) Each Equityholder that accepts payment of consideration in respect of the Merger as contemplated herein shall be deemed, by such acceptance of payment, or by his, her or its execution of the Letter of Transmittal, or by the approval of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.2, as the case may be, to have agreed that (i) the provisions of this Section 8.7 are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies such Equityholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the remedy at law for any breach of the provisions of this Section 8.7 would be inadequate, (iii) the Equityholders shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if such Equityholder brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Section 8.7 and (iv) the provisions of this Article VIII shall be binding upon such Equityholder and the successors and assigns of such Equityholder. 

   

 (d) In addition, each Equityholder that accepts payment of consideration in respect of the Merger as contemplated herein shall be deemed, by such acceptance of payment, or by his, her or its execution of the Letter of Transmittal, or by the approval of this Agreement in accordance with Section 5.2, as the case may be, to have waived any claims he, she or it may have or assert, including those that may arise in the future, against a Holder Representative or any of its Affiliates, for any action or inaction taken or not taken by such Holder Representative in connection therewith, except claims for fraud or claims based on actions taken or not taken by such Holder Representative in bad faith. 

   

 (e) Any notice or communication delivered by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to any Holder Representative shall be deemed to have been delivered to all Holder Representatives. Any notice or communication delivered by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to any Holder Representative shall, as between Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Equityholders, on the other hand, be deemed to have been delivered to all Equityholders. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any communication or writings given or executed by any Holder Representative in connection with any claims for indemnity or any requests for consent and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken or communications or writings given or executed by such Holder Representative. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to disregard any notices or communications given or made by the Equityholders in connection with any claims for indemnity unless given or made through a Holder Representative. 

   

 (f) Each Equityholder shall severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless each Holder Representative and his successors, permitted assigns, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, " _Holder Representative Indemnitees_ ") against all Losses incurred or sustained by a Holder Representative Indemnitee in connection with any Action, suit or proceeding to which such Holder Representative Indemnitee is made a party by   ##### 

  

  

  

reason of any act or omission in connection with his role as a Holder
Representative or its relationship to the Holder Representative, except for
fraud or willful misconduct. The Holder Representatives may, by joint action
of both of them, reimburse themselves for any amount incurred by or otherwise
owing to either of them under the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement (whether for fees, expenses, indemnification claims or otherwise)
from the Reserve Amount against proper invoices or receipts. In addition, if
any amount is incurred by or otherwise owing to any Holder Representative
under the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (whether for
fees, expenses, indemnification claims or otherwise) in excess of amounts
remaining from the Reserve Amount, the Holder Representatives may, by joint
action of both of them, deduct such amount from any succeeding distributions
to the Equityholders out of the Escrow Account. In the event that the Holder
Representatives determine that any expense or payment is appropriate or
desirable in connection with the exercise of their duties as Holder
Representatives or otherwise in connection with the protection of the rights
of the Equityholders, and such amount is not available from the Reserve
Amount, then each Equityholder shall, in accordance with instructions provided
by the Holder Representatives, provide its Pro-Rata Portion of such payment
or expense. In the event of any indemnification or reimbursement under this
Section 8.7(f) which is not funded by the Reserve Amount or the Escrow
Amount, the Holder Representatives may, by joint action, require that
such entire amount of indemnification or reimbursement shall be provided in
full, without limitation of the other provisions of this Section 8.7(f),
severally and not jointly, solely by the holders of Common Stock and
Preferred Stock, provided, that subsequently the Holder Representatives shall
use reasonable efforts to seek from the other Equityholders their respective
portions of such indemnification and reimbursement for the purpose of
reimbursing the holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock.
