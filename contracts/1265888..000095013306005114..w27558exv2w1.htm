of the portion of the merger consideration in respect thereof may be made to a transferee if the
certificate representing such shares is presented to the Payment Agent accompanied by all documents

contrary, each share of Common Stock or Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a stockholder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal
rights under Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be converted into
or exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration but
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section&nbsp;262 of
the DGCL; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that if such stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses the right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, each share of such stockholder shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the applicable portion of the merger consideration, and such
share shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.

deletion of such provision or provisions would result in such a material change as to cause

intent of the parties as closely as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the

agrees that all actions or proceedings relating to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
executed hereunder shall be litigated in such courts, and each of the parties waives any objection

or proceeding in any such court and waives personal service of any and all process upon it, and
consents to all such service of process made in the manner set forth in Section&nbsp;9.9. Nothing

irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by
