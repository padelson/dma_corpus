iii THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of May 4, 2017
(this "Agreement"), is made by and among Avantor, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Vail Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation ("Merger
Sub") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and VWR Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the parties hereto intend that, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving
corporation, and, pursuant to the Merger, each share of Company Common Stock
shall be converted in the Merger into the right to receive an amount per share
equal to $33.25 in cash and without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has (i) determined that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "Transactions") are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) duly authorized and approved the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions, (iii) declared this Agreement
and the Transactions advisable and (iv) resolved to recommend that the
Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have duly authorized
and approved the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub
of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Transactions, and the board of directors of Merger Sub has declared this
Agreement advisable;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Varietal Distribution Holdings, LLC ("VDH") has entered into a voting and
support agreement, dated as of the date hereof, in substantially the form set
forth in Annex I, pursuant to which, among other things, VDH has agreed to
vote its shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger and the
adoption of this Agreement as set forth therein (the "Voting Agreement").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

The Merger

 

SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, the Company and Merger
Sub shall consummate the Merger, whereby Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"). SECTION 1.02 _Merger Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Merger
Closing") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601
Lexington Ave., New York, New York 10022 on the second business day following
the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ , other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Merger Closing, unless another date, time or place is agreed
to in writing by Parent and the Company (but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Merger Closing); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ , unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties hereto, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to effect the Merger
Closing until the earlier of (i) a business day during the Marketing Period
specified by Parent on no less than two business days prior written notice
to the Company and (ii) the second business day following the final day of the
Marketing Period (subject in each case to the satisfaction of conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Merger Closing)). The date on which the
Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Merger Closing, the
Company shall prepare, and on the Closing Date the Company shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or
other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "Certificate of Merger")
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effectuate the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State or at such other time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

 

SECTION 1.04 _Effects of Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
provided in this Agreement and as set forth in the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and  By-laws_.

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.04_, at the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to be in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.04_, the By-laws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or permitted by applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger
Sub shall be replaced by the name of the Surviving Corporation.

 



2 SECTION 1.06 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be.

 

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

 

SECTION 1.07 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any of the
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the "Company Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock owned by any Company Subsidiary, which shall remain
outstanding), Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of other Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections_ __ _
1.07(b)_ and  _1.07(d)_ , each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.08_,
without interest.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares ("Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section 1.07(c)_ , but instead the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of such
Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ that if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid
the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such
Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive,
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.07(c)_. The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for

 



3  appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and Parent shall have the
right to participate (as defined for this purpose in _Section_ __ _ 5.09_)
in, and direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to, such
demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands
or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
otherwise to comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the Company, require the Company to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

SECTION 1.08 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration to
former holders of Company Common Stock. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Paying Agent, substantially
simultaneously with the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares
of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.07(c)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").

(b) _Payment Procedure_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates") that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.07_
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to
the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate are converted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.07_ and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 1.08_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.07_. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



4 (c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of record of Book-Entry
Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu thereof, such holder of record shall upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (or
such other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time to each such holder of record as of the Effective Time), an
amount of U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration
to which such holder is entitled hereunder and such Book-Entry Shares shall
forthwith be canceled.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ as a
result of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement. After the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for any reason they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article I_.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12 month anniversary of the Closing Date shall
be delivered to Parent or its designated affiliate, upon demand, and any
former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger
Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or its successor-in-interest for payment of
its claim for Merger Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat and other similar Law).

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such

 



5  Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designated affiliate, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representative previously
entitled thereto, subject to the claims of any former holder of Company Common
Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore
complied with this _Article I_.

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Payment Fund shall be invested by
the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit of
the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest. Nothing contained in this _Section 1.08(h)_ and no
investment losses resulting from the investment of the Payment Fund shall
diminish the rights of the stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration.
To the extent there are losses or the Payment Fund diminishes for any reason
below the level required to promptly pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.07(c)_ , Parent shall replace or restore the cash in the Payment
Fund to ensure the prompt payment of the Merger Consideration. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
paid to, Parent or its designated affiliate.

 

SECTION 1.09 _Equity Awards_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and converted into
the right to receive (i) an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the
excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the "Company Stock
Option Cash Consideration"). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay the Company Stock Option Cash Consideration at or reasonably promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the first payroll date
after the Effective Time unless the first payroll date after the
Effective Time is less than three business days after the Effective Time, in
which case, the second payroll date after the Effective Time). Following the
Effective Time, no holder of any Company Stock Option shall have the right to
acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving Corporation in
respect thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option with an
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that equals or exceeds the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without the payment of consideration.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit
granted under the Company Stock Plan with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Company RSUs") shall be converted into a vested right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay such amount at or reasonably promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the first payroll date
after the Effective Time unless the first payroll date after the Effective

or in equity and except as rights to indemnity and contribution may be limited

expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



26 (b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or
permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or

participation of the Company (as opposed to any third Person) in the
Transactions or (B) that the failure of which to obtain or make would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.05 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the
time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it is first published, sent or given to the
Companys stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
statements included or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company expressly for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

SECTION 3.06 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other Person, other than Goldman Sachs and Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC and

is entitled prior to the Effective Time to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and
the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or any of its affiliates.

 

SECTION 3.07 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
Proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against Parent or any subsidiary of Parent that would reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any Judgment outstanding against Parent or any subsidiary of
Parent that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.08 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. None of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been
at any time during the last three years, an "interested stockholder" of the
Company subject to the restrictions on "business combinations" (in each case,
as such quoted terms are defined under Section 203 of the DGCL) set forth in
Section 203(a) of the DGCL. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates is, or has been at any time during the last three years,
an "Interested Stockholder" (as such quoted term is defined in the Company
Charter). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their affiliates own any
shares of Company Common Stock.

 



27 SECTION 3.09 _Certain Business Relationships_. Neither Parent nor any of
its affiliates is a party to any Contract with any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

 

SECTION 3.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy
of (i) the executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, by and among Parent and the agents and lenders party thereto
(together with any other additional lead arrangers, bookrunners, managers,
arrangers, agents, co-agents or lenders who become party thereto,
collectively, the "Lenders"), including all exhibits, schedules, term sheets,
annexes and amendments thereto and any executed fee letters (redacted in
respect of (A) the amounts, percentages and basis points of compensation set
forth therein and (B) the pricing and other economic terms of the "market
flex" provisions set forth therein) (with respect to such redactions
described in subclauses (A) and (B) in this clause (i), none of which would
adversely affect the amount, conditionality, termination or availability of
such financing) (collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the Lenders have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent for the purpose of
paying the Required Amount on the Closing Date (such committed debt financing
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, together with, unless the context
otherwise requires, any debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the "Debt
Financing"), (ii) an executed preferred equity commitment letter from the
initial purchaser party thereto (together with any other purchasers who
become party thereto, collectively, the "Preferred Equity Investor"),
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto and any
executed closing payment letters (redacted in respect of (A) the amounts,
percentages and basis points of compensation set forth therein, (B) the
pricing and other economic terms set forth therein and (C) term sheets
attached thereto) (with respect to such redactions described in subclauses
(A) through (C) of this clause (ii), none of which would adversely affect the
amount, conditionality, termination or availability of such equity financing)
(collectively, the "Preferred Equity Commitment Letter" and, together with
the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters") to purchase, subject to
the terms and conditions therein, preferred equity securities of Parent (or
its Affiliate) in an initial aggregate liquidation preference amount set
forth therein for the purpose of payment of the Required Amount on the Closing
Date (such committed preferred equity purchase, the "Preferred Equity
Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing").

(b) As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect and have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect and no amendment or modification is
contemplated (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, amendments to each of
the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter solely
to add purchasers, equity investors, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities, as applicable, as parties thereto who
had not executed the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter, as applicable, as of the date hereof), and each of the
Commitment Letters, in the form so delivered, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto,

 



28  enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance with its
terms except as enforceability may be affected by the Bankruptcy, Equity and
Indemnity Exception. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are the
only agreements relating to the Financing and there are no other Contracts,
agreements, "side letters" or other arrangements to which Parent or any of its
affiliates is a party relating to the Commitment Letters or the Financing.

(c) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected
to result in, a default, breach or failure to satisfy any term or condition of
the Commitment Letters on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent,
any other party to the Commitment Letters, or would (i) make any of the
assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letters
inaccurate in any material respect, (ii) result in any of the conditions in
the Commitment Letters not being satisfied or (iii) otherwise result in the
Financing not being available on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no
Lender party to the Debt Commitment Letter has notified Parent of its
termination or repudiation (or intent to terminate or repudiate) any of the
commitments under such Debt Commitment Letter or intent not to provide the
Debt Financing. As of the date hereof, no party to the Preferred Equity
Commitment Letter has notified Parent of its termination or repudiation (or
intent to terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under such Preferred
Equity Commitment Letter or intent not to provide the Preferred Equity
Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the Companys obligations contained in
_Section 5.15(a)_ and the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _6.02_ , as
of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will fail to
satisfy any of the conditions in the Commitment Letters on a timely basis nor
does Parent have knowledge that any of the other parties to the Commitment
Letters will not perform their respective obligations thereunder.

 

(d) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment
fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid on or before
the date of this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing (after
netting out applicable closing payments, fees, expenses, original issue
discount and similar premiums and charges and after giving effect to the
maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under
the Debt Commitment Letter) constitute all of the financing required for the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, and are sufficient in
amount for Parent to refinance Parents, Merger Subs and certain of their
affiliates existing indebtedness for borrowed money and to satisfy all of its
obligations under this Agreement, including paying the Merger Consideration,
any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions (including any amounts payable in respect of Company Stock
Options and the Tax Receivables Agreement) and all associated fees, costs and
expenses in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions it is
required to pay, including the Financing (collectively, the "Required
Amount"). The only conditions precedent related to the obligations of the
Preferred Equity Investor to fund the full amount of the Preferred Equity
Financing and the Lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are
expressly set forth in the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt
Commitment Letter, respectively.

 

(e) Parents obligation to consummate the Merger is not contingent on
Parents ability to obtain any financing, whether pursuant to the Commitment
Letters or otherwise.

 



29 (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates
has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i) awarding any
agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory
role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Transactions or (ii)
expressly prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider
of debt financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or
financial advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction
relating to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
the Transactions.

SECTION 3.11 _Solvency_. Neither of Parent nor Merger Sub is entering
into this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present
or future creditors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
Assuming (a) satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger
Subs obligations to consummate the Merger (including the condition set forth
in _Section 6.02(a)_ ), (b) the Required Information fairly presents the
consolidated financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries as at
the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of
earnings of the Company and its subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
and (c) any financial forecasts of the Company made available to Parent as
of the date hereof have been prepared in good faith upon assumptions that
were reasonable at such time (it being understood that the Company is not
making any representation and warranty with respect thereto, including as a
result of such assumption in this clause (c)), and after giving effect to the
Transactions and the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Required
Amount, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Solvent," when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination, (a) the fair value of the assets of
such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at a fair valuation,
will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, of such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (b)
the present fair saleable value of the property of such Person and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than the amount that
will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts and other liabilities,
direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other
liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital with which to
conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such businesses are now
conducted and are proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date and (d)
such Person and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be able to pay
their debts and liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as
such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured.

SECTION 3.12 _Independent Investigation_. Parent and Merger Sub have
conducted their own independent investigation, review and analysis of the
business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition, and prospects of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which
investigation, review and analysis was done by Parent and its affiliates and
Representatives. In entering into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that they have not relied upon any statements, representations or
opinions of the Company or its Representatives, except the representations
and warranties of the Company made in _Article II_ or in the certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_. Except for the representations and
warranties of the Company made in _Article II_ or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_ , Parent acknowledges and
agrees that none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries and
affiliates or any other Person makes, nor is Parent or Merger Sub

 



30  relying on, any other express, implied or statutory representation or
warranty with respect to or on behalf of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
or their affiliates or with respect to any other information provided or made
available to Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives in connection with
the Merger or the other Transactions, including the accuracy or completeness
thereof. Parent acknowledges that there are assumptions inherent in making
any projections, estimates and budgets, Parent is familiar with such
uncertainties and that Parent is responsible for making its own evaluation of
the Company and shall have no claim against the Company or any other Person
with respect thereto.

SECTION 3.13 _No Foreign Person._ As of the date of this Agreement, none
of the Equity Investors, Parent, or Merger Sub is or will be a "foreign
person" within the meaning of 31 C.F.R. § 800.216 (a "Foreign Person") such
that the Merger or the other Transactions would constitute a covered
transaction within the meaning of 31 C.F.R. § 800.207 subject to a national
security review, national security investigation, or action by the President
as prescribed in Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, 50 U.S.C.
§ 4501 et seq., as amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security
Act of 2007 (a "Covered Transaction").

that the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal (a "Qualifying Company
Takeover Proposal"), the Company may (A) furnish non-public information and
other access to the Person making such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal
and its Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement so
long as the Company also provides Parent, in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and substantially concurrently with the time such
information or access is provided to such other Person (and in any event
within 24 hours), any material non-public information or access with respect
to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries furnished to such other Person that
was not previously furnished to Parent, and (B) enter into or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal, including
soliciting, encouraging and facilitating the making of a revised Qualifying
Company Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that the Company may only take the
actions described in clauses (A) or (B) above after the No-Shop Period Start
Date if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take any such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (C) fail to
publicly reaffirm, up to a maximum of two times ( _provided_ that, Parent
shall be entitled to an additional two such reaffirmations for each
Intervening Event or publicly announced change to any material term of
a Company Takeover Proposal), the Company Board Recommendation within five
(5) business days after Parent so requests in writing (or such fewer number of
days as remain prior to the Stockholders Meeting, as it may be adjourned or
postponed in accordance with this Agreement), (D) fail to recommend in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 rejection of a Company
Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer subject
to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act (other than by Parent and its
affiliates) within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such tender
offer or exchange offer (or such fewer number of days as remain prior to the
Stockholders Meeting, as it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with
this Agreement) or (E) resolve, publicly announce an intention or agree to
take any of the foregoing

 



36  actions (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to herein as
an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement providing for any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
accordance with _Section 4.03(a)_ or _Section 4.03(c)_ ), or resolve, agree or
publicly propose to take any such action. Notwithstanding anything to contrary
in the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior
to, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote has been obtained (x) the
Company Board may, in response to an Intervening Event, take or fail to take
any of the actions specified in clauses (A), (C), (D) or (E) of the
definition of Adverse Recommendation Change (an "Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change") if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.01(f)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Company Proposal ( _provided_ that concurrently with such termination
the Company pays any Company Termination Fee to be made pursuant to _Section
5.05(b))_ ;  _provided_ that, prior to so making an Intervening Event Adverse
Recommendation Change or so terminating this Agreement, (1) the Company shall
have materially complied with this _Section_ __ _ 4.03_, (2) the Company
Board shall have given Parent at least four business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the reasons
for taking such action (which notice, in respect of a Superior Company
Proposal, shall specify in writing the identity of the Person or group of
Persons who made such Superior Company Proposal and all of the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Company Proposal and attach the most current
version of the relevant transaction agreement and other material definitive
documents (including financing commitments)), (3) the Company shall have
negotiated, and shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate in good
faith, with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement in such a
manner that would eliminate the need for taking such action (and in respect of
a Superior Company Proposal, would cause such Superior Company Proposal to no
longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal), (4) following the end of such
notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement offered in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to effect such Company Intervening Event Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement to accept such Superior Company Proposal
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and, with respect to a Superior Company Proposal, that such
Superior Company Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Company Proposal
and (5) in the event of any material change to any of the terms or conditions
of such Superior Company Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, deliver to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (2) of
this proviso and a renewed notice period under clause (2) of this proviso
shall commence (except that the four-business-day notice period referred to in
clause (2) of this proviso shall instead be equal to two business days) during
which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of
this _Section 4.03(d)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (1) through (4) of this proviso.

 



37 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), including making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the stockholders of the Company, or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 4.03(e)_  shall not be deemed
to affect whether any such action (other than a recommendation against a
Company Takeover Proposal or a "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act) would
otherwise constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(f) In addition to the requirements set forth in _Section 4.03(c)_ and
_Section 4.03(d)_ , from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company
shall, as promptly as practicable and in any event within one business day
after receipt thereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of
(i) any Company Takeover Proposal or any request for information or inquiry,
proposal or offer that the Company reasonably believes would lead to or
contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) the terms and conditions of
such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (including any
subsequent amendments or modifications thereto and whether made in writing or
orally communicated) and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
any such Company Takeover Proposal or request, inquiry, proposal or offer.
Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to above, the Company and
its Representatives shall keep Parent informed in reasonable detail on a
reasonably prompt basis as to the status and details of any such Company
Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal or offer (and any subsequent amendments
or modifications thereto) and any material developments or modifications to
the terms thereof.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 4.03_, the Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) any violation of the
restrictions or obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ by any
Company Subsidiary or their or the Companys Representatives at the Companys
or the Company Subsidiaries direction shall constitute a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.03_ by the Company and (ii) it shall not nor shall it permit
the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement that prohibits
or restricts the Company from providing to Parent the information
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 4.03_ or complying with _Section
4.03(d)_.

surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or
such surviving entity, other than, in each case, the Transactions.

the Company Board determines, in good faith, on or prior to the Go-Shop Period
End Date, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor,

such time following the No-Shop Period Start Date that the Company Takeover
Proposal submitted by such Person is withdrawn or terminated (it being
understood that any amendment, modification or replacement of such Company
Takeover Proposal shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a withdrawal of such
Company Takeover Proposal) or (ii) if such Persons Company Takeover Proposal

ARTICLE V

 

Additional Agreements

 

SECTION 5.01 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Except if
prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours (under the supervision of
appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operation of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms to all their
respective properties, books and records, Contracts and personnel (subject to
the chief executive officers or general counsels consent as set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.01_) and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish, reasonably promptly, to
Parent all information in its possession concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that any such
access shall be afforded and any such information shall be furnished at
Parents expense; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such access shall not
include any environmental sampling or testing or any invasive or subsurface
investigation. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to afford
access or furnish information to the extent (a) such information is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (b) such
information relates to the applicable portions of the minutes of the meetings
of the Company Board (including any presentations or other materials prepared
by or for the Company Board) where the Company Board discussed the
Transactions or any similar transaction involving the sale of the Company to,
or combination of the Company with, any other Person or (c) the Company
determines in good faith that affording such access or furnishing such
information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, violate applicable Law or result in
significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
as applicable ( _provided_ that the Company shall cooperate with Parent in
seeking, and use reasonable best efforts to secure any consent or waiver or
other arrangement to allow disclosure of such information in a manner that
would not result in such violation, contravention, prejudice, or loss of
privilege). Prior to the Effective Time, other than in the ordinary course of
their respective businesses and not in connection with the Transactions,
Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives may only contact and communicate
with the personnel, customers, service providers, regulators, vendors and
suppliers of the Company and

 



40  the Company Subsidiaries related to the Transactions after prior
consultation with and the written consent of the chief executive officer or
general counsel of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prevent or
prohibit Parent, Merger Sub and their Representatives from contacting or
communicating with their own personnel, customers, service
providers, regulators, vendors and suppliers on matters unrelated to the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or the Transactions. All information
exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.01_ shall be subject to the
confidentiality letter agreement dated April 2, 2017 between the Company, New
Mountain Capital, L.L.C. and Parent (which agreement shall automatically
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the Merger Closing) (as
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the
"Confidentiality Agreement") and the Company and Parent shall comply with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.02 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers
and consents from, the making of all necessary registrations, declarations
and filings with and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to
avoid a Proceeding by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement
or the Transactions, (ii) the defending or contesting of any Proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and the Company Board shall use reasonable best
efforts to (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any Transaction or
this Agreement and (B) if any Takeover Law or similar statute or regulation
becomes applicable to any Transaction or this Agreement, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Transactions and this
Agreement.

(b) Parent and the Company shall, in consultation and cooperation with the
other, (i) file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the Notification and
Report Form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the Merger or any of the
other Transactions as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than
twenty (20) business days after the date of this Agreement), (ii) make
all necessary filings as required under the FATA as promptly as practicable,
(iii) make all appropriate filings, notices, applications or similar documents
required under any Foreign Antitrust Law as promptly as practicable; and (iv)
if (A) a filing is formally or informally requested by CFIUS, (B) within 70
days of the date of this Agreement Parent or the Company determines a CFIUS
filing is advisable related to the transactions contemplated by this 

 



41  Agreement or (C) a CFIUS Investigation is commenced for any other reason,
then, in each case, the parties hereto shall as soon as practicable submit to
CFIUS a draft of a joint voluntary notice of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (the "CFIUS Notice"). Each of Parent and the Company shall (i)
furnish to the other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may request in connection with its preparation
of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act, the FATA,
the Exon-Florio Amendment, the NISPOM, the ITAR or any Foreign Antitrust Law,
(ii) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such filings or
submissions and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of any substantive
communication with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC, the DOJ, DDTC, CFIUS, DSS, and any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and permit the other
party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of, and secure the participation of, the other party in connection with, any
such filings, submissions, substantive communications, substantive inquiries
or requests, _provided_ that such materials may be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company or other competitively
sensitive information; (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements or applicable Law; and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
confidentiality concerns, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Entity, and to the extent reasonably practicable, (A)
not participate in or attend any meeting or engage in any substantive
conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Merger or any of
the other Transactions without the other party, (B) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event
one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any
such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect thereto, (D)
cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings,
correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Entity and (E) furnish the other party with copies of
all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or
members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, _provided_ that that
materials may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company; (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
applicable Law; and (z) as necessary to address reasonable confidentiality
concerns, and (iv) comply with any inquiry or request from the FTC, CFIUS,
DSS, DDTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Parent agrees not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting
period under the Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with a
Governmental Entity to delay or not consummate the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld ( _provided_ such extension does not
go beyond the Outside Date).

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid,
eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all clearances,
consents, approvals and waivers under any Antitrust Laws or the FATA that may
be required by any Governmental Entity, CFIUS Approval and DSS Approval, so
as to enable the parties to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date), including committing to and
effecting, by consent

 



42  decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, (i) the sale, license,
holding separate, divestiture or other disposition of assets or businesses of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, (ii)
terminating, relinquishing, modifying or waiving existing relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
Company or their respective subsidiaries, (iii) creating any relationships,
ventures, contractual rights, obligations or other arrangements of Parent or
the Company or their respective subsidiaries, and (iv) accepting all such
requirements, mitigation measures, or conditions as may be requested
or required by CFIUS, DSS or any other Governmental Entity as necessary or
advisable in connection with, or as a condition of, the receipt of CFIUS
Approval or DSS Approval (each a "Remedial Action"); _provided_ that the
Company shall not be obligated to agree to, commit or effect, any Remedial
Action unless such Remedial Action is conditioned upon, or will occur
subsequent to, consummation of the Transactions. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any litigation or other
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is commenced, threatened or is
foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions and such litigation, action or
proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
Parent shall take any and all action, including a Remedial Action, to avoid or
resolve any such litigation, action or proceeding and each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such litigation,
action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions as promptly as practicable (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, including the prior two sentences of this _Section 5.02(c)_ ,
nothing in this _Section 5.02(c)_ or otherwise shall require or obligate
Parent and Merger Sub or any of their affiliates to take any Remedial Action
with respect to Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates, including any of the Remedial Actions described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of the first sentence in this _Section 5.02(c)_ , if
any such Remedial Action individually or in the aggregate has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, assets, liabilities, businesses or results of operations of Parent,
the Company, and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any
rights, assets, business, Person or division thereof (through acquisition,
license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition
would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining
(i) any applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under any U.S.
Antitrust Law, the FATA or any Foreign Antitrust Law or (ii) CFIUS Approval or
DSS Approval with respect to the Transactions.

(e) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company will submit to DSS and, to the extent applicable, any other
Governmental Entity, notification of the Transactions pursuant to the NISPOM
and any other applicable national security or industrial security regulations,
and submit and request approval of measures to mitigate foreign ownership,
control or influence ("FOCI") arising as a result of the Merger and the other
transactions. Each of Parent and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to finally and successfully obtain CFIUS Approval and
DSS Approval as promptly as practicable.

 



43 (f) As soon as possible after the execution of this Agreement, but in
no event later than twenty (20) business days thereafter, Parent shall
prepare and file with DDTC a notice of the Transactions as required under the
ITAR, 22 CFR 122.4(b). Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond promptly to any inquiries received from DDTC for
additional information or documentation, and to respond promptly to all
inquiries and requests from DDTC in connection with such notice.

 

(g) Each of Parent and the Company shall provide CFIUS, DSS or DDTC with
any additional or supplemental information requested by CFIUS, DSS or DDTC
during their respective review process as promptly as practicable, and in all
cases within the amount of time allowed by CFIUS, DSS or DDTC.

 

SECTION 5.03 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and for a period of one year following
the Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide or cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and
who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Company Subsidiary (each, a "Company Employee") (i) salary and incentive
opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate
(excluding any value attributable to equity-based compensation) than those
provided to such Company Employee by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (excluding
defined benefit pension plan benefits) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Company Employee by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, during the Continuation Period, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide any Company Employee
who experiences a termination of employment under circumstances that would
have entitled such Company Employee to severance benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement applicable to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date with severance benefits at a level at
least equal to the severance benefits payable under such Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement.

 

(b) Following the Continuation Period, to the extent that any of the
existing Company Benefit Plans are discontinued, each Company Employee shall
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
affiliates (the "Surviving Corporation Plans") to the extent coverage under
any such plan is necessary to replace coverage under the discontinued Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participates immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.03(a)_ , from and after
the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until
all obligations thereunder have been

 



44  satisfied, all of the Companys employment, severance, retention,
termination and change in control plans, policies, programs, agreements and
arrangements (including any change in control severance agreement or other
Company Benefit Agreement between the Company and any Company Employee)
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as in
effect on the Closing Date, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event) in accordance with their terms.

 

(d) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by
Parent or any of its respective subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid
time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and
early retirement subsidies, each Company Employees service with the Company
or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer
of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer was recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary)
shall be treated as service with Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries; _provided_ that such service need not be recognized (i) to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for
the same period of service or (ii) with respect to any benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan.

 

(e) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Company Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions and
waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries, to the extent such limitations were
waived, satisfied or did not apply to such employees or eligible dependents
or beneficiaries under the corresponding welfare Company Benefit Plan in which
such employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
provide Company Employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective
Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket maximum
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan, in each case,
except to the extent it would result in any duplication of benefits.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other Person
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_, and no provision of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_ shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or any employee program or
any plan or arrangement of Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall be
construed to modify, amend, or establish any benefit plan, program or
arrangement or in any way affect the ability of the parties hereto or any
other Person to modify, amend or terminate any of its benefit plans, programs
or arrangements.

 



45 SECTION 5.04 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an
"Indemnified Party") as provided in the Company Charter, the Company By-laws,
the organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification
agreement listed on _Section 5.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter between
such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement (i) shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective
Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger, (iii) shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any
such Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iv) for a
period of six years following the date of this Agreement shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure
that the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the
foregoing obligations.

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)_ or any rights of any
Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement listed on
_Section_ __ _ 5.04(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the
Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding, whether
civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the fact that at or prior to the
Effective Time the Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan)
of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors, whether in any case asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided
in the Company Charter and Company By-laws (or the corresponding
organizational documents of the applicable Company Subsidiary; _provided_
that if such documents provide for a lesser degree of indemnification than as
is provided in the Company Charter and Company By-laws, such Indemnified Party
shall be indemnified and held harmless as and to the fullest extent provided
in the Company Charter and Company By-laws as if they instead applied), each
such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon receipt of any
undertaking required by the Company Charter and Company By-laws (or the
corresponding organizational documents of the applicable Company Subsidiary;
_provided_ that if such documents require a greater undertaking than the
Company Charter and Company By-laws, what is required by the Company Charter
and Company By-laws shall instead apply), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual
Proceeding). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with each
Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified
Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parents and the Surviving
Corporations obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.04(b)_ shall continue
in full force and effect for the period beginning upon the Effective Time
until six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



46 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the Effective
Time and ending six years from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified
Party and containing terms (including with respect to coverage and amounts)
and conditions (including with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that
are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified
Party than those of the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement (the "Existing DandO
Policies"); _provided_ that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such
"tail" insurance policies shall not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual
premium payable by the Company for coverage for its current fiscal year under
the Existing DandO Policies (which amount the Company represents and warrants is
set forth in _Section 5.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the
"Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If such "tail" insurance policies have been
obtained by the Company, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
such "tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for
their full term, and use reasonable best efforts to cause all its obligations
thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation _._ In the event
the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then, for the
period beginning upon the Effective Time and ending six years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Existing DandO Policies in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions); provided that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of the Maximum
DandO Tail Premium; _provided further_ that if the annual premium of such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous
policies available for an annual premium equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a
substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii)
Parent or any of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving
Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision
to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or
transferees assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_.

(e) Prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this  _Section_ __ _ 5.04_ applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.04_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives,
and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which
each Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise.

 



47 SECTION 5.05 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.01_, _Section_ __ _ 5.04_,
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.05_, _Section_ __ _ 5.07_, _Section_ __ _ 5.15_,
_Section 5.16(a)_ and _Section 5.16(b)_ , all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions shall
be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated.

 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent or its designee a fee of $85,000,000
(if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date or, if
after the Go-Shop Period End Date, in connection with a Company Takeover
Proposal from an Excluded Party)) or, otherwise, $170,000,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee"), in each case, if:

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(f))_ ;

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.01(d)_ ; or

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is
publicly proposed or announced or made known to the Company Board, (B)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.01(h)_ or by Parent pursuant
to  _Section 7.01(c)_ and (C) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months
after such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate, or consummates, a Company Takeover Proposal (regardless of whether
a Company Takeover Proposal relates to the same Company Takeover Proposal
referred to in clause (A)).

For purposes of this _Section 5.05(b)_ , the term "Company Takeover Proposal"
shall have the meaning set forth in the definition of Company Takeover
Proposal contained in _Section 4.03(h)_ except that all references to 20%
shall be deemed to be references to 50%. Any fee due under this _Section
5.05(b)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account
designated by Parent, (1) in the case of clause (i) above, prior to or
simultaneously with such termination of this Agreement, (2) in the case of
clause (ii) above, within two business days after the date of such termination
of this Agreement and (3) in the case of clause (iii) above, within two
business days of the consummation of such Company Takeover Proposal. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether
or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times or for the
occurrence of different events, and, in such event, the lowest Company
Termination Fee shall be the amount payable.

 

(c) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under _Section_ __ _ 5.05(b)(i)_
shall constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of
this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 7.01(f)_ (but not the amount of the
Company Termination Fee). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event the Company Termination Fee described in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.05_ is paid to Parent or its designee, such Company
Termination Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Merger Sub against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective current, former or future Representatives for any loss suffered as
a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee none of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective current, former or future
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, other than for Willful
Breach to the extent set forth in the next sentence.

 



48 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ , _Section_ __ _ 7.01(e)_ or _7.01(g)_ or
by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)(ii)_ or _Section 7.01(b)(i)_ if the
Company had the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.01(e)_ or _7.01(g)_ at such time, then the Company or its designee shall be
entitled to receive and Parent shall pay to the Company, within two (2)
business days following the date of such termination, an amount equal to
$300,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee"). Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Parent Termination Fee described
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ is paid to the Company, such Parent Termination
Fee shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against the
Third Party Financing Related Parties for any loss suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated, and upon payment of the Parent
Termination Fee none of the Third Party Financing Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions. Any Parent Termination Fee due under this 
_Section 5.05(d)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Company. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent
Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same or at different times or for the occurrence of different events.
Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Parent Termination Fee
shall not constitute a penalty but instead is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in the circumstances in
which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

(e) While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.10_ and the payment
of the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable,
under no circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to
receive both (i) a grant of specific performance that results in the Merger
Closing occurring and (ii) any money damages (including the Parent Termination
Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Parent
or Merger Sub breaches this Agreement (whether such breach is intentional and
material, unintentional, willful or otherwise or is a Willful Breach) or fails
to perform hereunder (whether such failure is intentional and material,
unintentional, willful or otherwise or is a Willful Breach), the Companys
right to: (i) seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief in accordance with the terms and limitations of _Section_ __ _ 8.10_;
or (ii) terminate this Agreement and (A) receive the Parent Termination Fee
if payable pursuant to _Section 5.05(d)_ and (B) if the Parent Termination Fee
is not payable pursuant to _Section 5.05(d)_ , seek money damages from Parent
in the event of Parents or Merger Subs Willful Breach, shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies (whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) of the Company and the Company Related
Parties against the Parent Related Parties or the Third Party Financing
Related Parties for any losses, damages, costs, expenses,

 



49  obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to this Agreement (or
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation
contained herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any
failure of such transactions to be consummated), the Commitment Letters, the
financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be
consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the
transactions contemplated herein or therein or otherwise; _provided_ that in
no event shall Parent have any monetary liability or obligations pursuant to
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) in the aggregate in excess of the amount of
the Parent Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company or any Company
Related Party seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against any Parent
Related Parties (other than Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement, to
the extent set forth in and in accordance with the terms thereof) or Third
Party Financing Related Parties, or compel payment by any Third Party
Financing Related Parties (other than Parent under the Confidentiality
Agreement, to the extent set forth in and in accordance with the terms
thereof) or Parent Related Parties of, any damages or other payments
whatsoever and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party
seek, directly or indirectly, to recover against Parent and Merger Sub, or
compel payment by Parent and Merger Sub of, any damages or other payments in
excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

(g) The Company agrees, on behalf of itself and its Non-Recourse Parties,
and Parent and Merger Sub each agree, on behalf of itself and their
respective Non-Recourse Parties, that all actions, claims, obligations,
liabilities or causes of action (whether such remedies are sought in equity
or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise) arising out of or related to
this Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation contained herein), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (or any failure of such transactions to be consummated), the
Commitment Letters and the financings contemplated therein (or any failure of
such financings to be consummated), or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment
Letters or otherwise, in each case, may be made only against the Persons that
are expressly identified as the parties to this Agreement and, in accordance
with, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except for
claims that the Company or Parent may bring under, and pursuant to the terms
and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company hereby waives any and all claims
against any and all Third Party Financing Related Parties arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger, the Financing or any other Transaction.

 

SECTION 5.06 _Public Announcements_. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger
and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national or foreign securities exchange and except
as contemplated, permitted or required by _Section_ __ _ 4.03_. The parties
hereto agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties
hereto. 

 



50 SECTION 5.07 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided in _Section 1.08(b)_ of
this Agreement, all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions
to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the
Transactions and imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
paid by the Surviving Corporation and the Company shall cooperate with Merger
Sub and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect
to such Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 5.08 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. If the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent
determines to withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to notify the recipient of such withholding at
least five (5) business days prior to the date upon which such payment is
to be made to provide such recipient with a reasonable opportunity to provide
any form or documentation or take such other steps as may be required in order
to eliminate or minimize any such withholding. Amounts withheld pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made.

 

SECTION 5.09 _Stockholder Litigation_. Until the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company shall provide Parent
an opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and prosecution of
any stockholder litigation against the Company or its directors relating to
any Transaction (the "Transaction Litigation") and consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any such stockholder
litigation, including the opportunity to review and to propose comments to all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with
any such stockholder litigation and the Company shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments proposed by Parent. In no event shall the
Company enter into, agree to or disclose any settlement with respect to such
stockholder litigation without Parents consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except to the extent such
settlement is fully covered by the Companys insurance policies (other
than any applicable deductible), but only if such settlement would not result
in the imposition of any material restriction on the business or operations of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or affiliates. Each of Parent
and the Company shall notify the other promptly of the commencement of any
such stockholder litigation of which it has received notice and prior to the
Effective Time, each of (x) the Company and (y) Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly notify the other of all (i) notices and other communications
received by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its
subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub and
(ii) civil, criminal or

 



51  administrative actions, suits, claims, hearings, arbitrations,
investigations or other proceedings commenced or threatened against the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company Board, or any
committee thereof, or Parent or any of its subsidiaries, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this  _Section_
__ _ 5.09_ and _Section 1.07(d)_ , "participate" means that Parent will be
kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions
with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that
the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation which the
Company shall consider in good faith, but Parent will not be afforded any
decision making power or other authority over such Transaction Litigation;
provided, that no settlement shall be offered or entered into or payment made
without the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, any litigation
relating to Appraisal Shares shall be governed by _Section 1.07(d)_.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Works Councils_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
shall comply in all material respects with all notification, consultation and
other processes with respect to any works council, economic committee, union
or similar body as required by applicable Law to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which may include any required notifications
and consultation and other processes with respect to any works council,
economic committee, union or similar body.

 

SECTION 5.11 _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3 Matters_. The Company shall take all
reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 5.12 _Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance_. Parent
shall cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to comply
with all of its respective obligations under this Agreement and Merger Sub
shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as provided in or
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Companys securities to be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time.

 

SECTION 5.14 _No Control of Other Party_ __ _s Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys or the
Company Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and
the Company Subsidiaries respective operations.

 



52 SECTION 5.15 _Parent Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their subsidiaries to, use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including
using their reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly negotiate definitive
agreements on the terms (including any market flex and securities demand
provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter) and subject only to the
conditions contained in the Commitment Letters so that such agreements are in
effect on the Closing Date, (ii) promptly satisfy (or obtain a waiver to) or
cause the satisfaction (or waiver) of all conditions in the Commitment
Letters and the definitive agreements for the Financing (the "Financing
Agreements") applicable to, and within the control of, Parent or Merger Sub or
any of their affiliates in such documents, (iii) consummate the Financing on
or prior to the date on which the consummation of the Merger Closing is
required to occur, (iv) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters and
(v) comply with and maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters.

(b) In the event that, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts
by Parent to satisfy its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_, any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and subject only to
the conditions (including any market flex and securities demand provisions)
contemplated in the Commitment Letters (unless such portion is not reasonably
required to consummate the Transactions and to pay the Required Amount on the
Closing Date), Parent shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, promptly
(and in any event, within one business day) notify the Company thereof, and
the reason for the unavailability, and use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable, alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to pay the Required Amount as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event; _provided_ that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, such alternative financing shall not have any of the
effects described in clauses (1) through (5) of _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)(i)_.
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements
pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide
Parent with any portion of the Financing substantially concurrently with the
execution thereof. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.15_ shall apply to
any alternative financing _mutatis mutandis_. For the avoidance of doubt,
the failure to arrange for any such alternative financing does not relieve
Parent or Merger Sub of any of their obligations under this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements relating to the Financing;
_provided_ that: (i) without the prior written consent of the Company, no such
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver shall (1) reduce
(or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount in respect of the Financing) to less than the Required Amount (after
giving effect to Parents available cash on hand), (2) add new conditions
precedent or contingencies to the Financing or amend, replace, supplement or
modify any existing conditions precedent or contingencies to the Financing in
a manner adverse to Parent (or its affiliates) or that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, impede or delay or make less likely to occur the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions or contingencies to the
Financing) on the Closing Date, (3) delay the funding of the Financing or
reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or delay the availability of the
Financing on the date upon which the Merger Closing is required to occur
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_, (4) waive any remedy available to Parent
thereunder or adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce or

 



53  cause the enforcement of its rights under the Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements relating to the Financing, (5) impose obligations on the
Company or its affiliates that would be effective prior to the Effective Time
or (6) allow for the early termination of the Commitment Letters; and (ii) it
is understood and agreed that Parent may amend the Commitment Letters to the
extent permitted therein to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents,
managers, purchasers or similar entities that have not executed the relevant
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that the certificate to be delivered by an authorized officer of the
Company under paragraph 10 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter or
paragraph 9 of Exhibit D of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter, in each
case, with respect to the solvency of the Company may be delivered by an
individual who is an authorized officer of the Company as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(d) To the extent Parent obtains alternative financing pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.15(b)_, or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives
any of the Financing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.15(c)_, references to
the "Financing," "Debt Financing," "Commitment Letter," "Debt Commitment
Letter," "Preferred Equity Commitment Letter," and "Financing Agreement" (and
other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to refer to such
alternative financing, the commitments thereunder and the agreements with
respect thereto, or the Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented,
modified or waived.

 

(e) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
timely basis and in reasonable detail of the status of Parents efforts to
arrange and obtain the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company, upon reasonable request, with copies of agreements relating to the
Financing and such other information and documentation regarding such
Financing as shall be reasonably necessary or proper to allow the Company to
monitor the progress of such financing activities. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any event within
one business day) if at any time prior to the Closing Date: (i) the
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements expire or are terminated for any
reason, (ii) Parent obtains knowledge of any material breach or default by any
party to any Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default), (iii)
Parent receives any written notice or other communication from any Person
providing a Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement with respect to any
(1) actual, potential or threatened breach, default, withdrawal, rescission,
termination or repudiation (whether in whole or in part) by any party to the
Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreement or (2) a dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Commitment Letters or any Financing
Agreement with respect to the obligation to fund the Financings or the amount
of the Financings to be funded upon the consummation of the Merger Closing or
(iv) any other event or development occurs that Parent expects to have a
material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to obtain all or any
material portion of the Financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters or
any Financing Agreement on the terms, in the manner or from the sources

burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public policy,
all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 



74 SECTION 8.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or
other electronic image scan transmission shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.07 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Other
Representations or Warranties_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
(i) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties and their affiliates,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) except for
_Section_ __ _ 5.04_ and for the rights of the Third Party Financing Related
Parties pursuant to _Sections 5.05(d)_ , _7.03(a)_ , _8.10(c)_ , _8.11_ and
_8.13_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 8.07_, are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties any rights or remedies. Notwithstanding clause
(ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, following the Effective Time the
provisions of  _Article_ __ _ I_ shall be enforceable by holders of
Certificates and holders of Book-Entry Shares

 

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in _Article II_
or in the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_ , each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on
behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or
with respect to any other information made available to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the Transactions. In connection with the due diligence
investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plans and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and
operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, with which Parent and Merger
Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are making their own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and
other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans and cost-
related plans, furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans), and that neither Parent
nor Merger Sub has relied upon the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, or any other
Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any other
Person, has made or is making any

 



75  representation or warranty or has or shall have any liability (whether
pursuant to this Agreement, in tort or otherwise) with respect to such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business
plans or cost-related plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information, business plans or cost-related plans), except as expressly set
forth in _Article II_ of this Agreement or in the certificate delivered
pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_.

 

(c) Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in
_Article III_ , the Voting Agreement, the Commitment Letters and in the
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 6.03(c)_ , none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub or in any certificate or other document delivered in connection
with this Agreement.

 

SECTION 8.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

 

SECTION 8.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of
any of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided further_  that any
such assignment shall not otherwise impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.09_, Parent and Merger Sub may pledge
their rights hereunder as security to the Lenders or any of their financing
sources (or any agent or collateral trustee for any such person); _provided_
that no such assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations
hereunder.

SECTION 8.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction_.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in _Section
8.10(c)_ , without proof of damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific enforcement shall include
the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Merger
and the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this

 



76  Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without such
right none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
_Section 8.10(a)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the
right to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies
in connection with enforcing Parent and Merger Subs obligations to effect the
Merger Closing, if and only if: (i) the Marketing Period has ended and Parent
is required to complete the Merger Closing pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_
and Parent fails to complete the Merger Closing by the date the Merger Closing
is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_, (ii) the
financing provided for by the Financing (or, if alternative financing, as the
case may be) has been funded or will be funded in accordance with the terms of
the Commitment Letter at the Merger Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and
the Financing is funded, then the Merger Closing will occur in accordance with
_Article I_.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to the jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the State of Delaware for the purpose
of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions
of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such Proceeding may be
heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or Federal court. Each
of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State
of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the
event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) irrevocably consents to the service of process in any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by U.S. registered mail to
such partys respective address set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ (
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 8.10(c)_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law) and
(iv) agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto agree that a final trial
court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law; _provided_ that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any
partys rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from,
such final trial court judgment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and irrevocably
agrees: (i) that any Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, involving the Third Party Financing Related Parties arising
out of, or relating to this Agreement, the Financing or the performance of
services thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in
the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each of the

 



77  parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court with respect to
any such legal proceeding; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their affiliates
to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Proceeding in any other
court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
the Commitment Letter or in  _Section_ __ _ 8.02_ will be effective service
of process against them for any such Proceeding brought in any such court;
(iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of,
any such Proceeding in any such court; (v) that any such Proceeding will be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
and (vi) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
such Proceeding

 

SECTION 8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the
Merger or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section_
__ _ 8.11_.

 

SECTION 8.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the rights and remedies provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable Law, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 

SECTION 8.13 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement or otherwise, the parties to this Agreement agree on their own
behalf and on behalf of their respective subsidiaries and affiliates that no
Non-Recourse Party or any Third Party Financing Related Party shall have any
liability relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions except to the
extent expressly agreed to in writing by such Non-Recourse Party or such Third
Party Financing Related Party (as applicable).

 

SECTION 8.14 _Cooperation_. The parties agree to provide reasonable
cooperation with each other and to execute and deliver such further
documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such actions
as may be reasonably requested by the other parties to evidence or effect the
Transactions and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.
