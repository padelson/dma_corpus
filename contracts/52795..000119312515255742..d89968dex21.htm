Section 2.9 _Adjustment to Base Purchase Price_.

 

(a) Section 2.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a calculation of
the Working Capital, the Cash Amounts and the Funded Debt of the Purchased
Companies and their Subsidiaries, in each case, as of June 28, 2015 (the "
_Sample Closing Statement_ "), including the asset and liability line items
and general ledger accounts. The Sample Closing Statement shall be prepared
consistent with the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and
policies set forth on Section 2.9 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (such
principles, practices, methodologies and policies, collectively, the "
_Transaction Accounting Principles_ ").

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, HD
Supply shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer a closing statement
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth its good-faith estimate of (i) the
Closing Working Capital, (ii) the Adjustment Amount, (iii) the Closing Cash
Amounts and (iv) the Closing Funded Debt and such estimates shall be deemed
the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ," " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_
," " _Estimated Closing Cash Amounts_ " and " _Estimated Closing Funded Debt_
," respectively, for purposes of this Agreement. The Closing Statement shall
set forth the calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with the
Sample Closing Statement and shall be prepared in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles; _provided_ , _however_ , that assets newly
acquired and liabilities newly incurred following the date of the Sample
Closing Statement that cannot be appropriately placed in line
items previously used by HD Supply, but that constitute assets or liabilities
of the Purchased Companies, Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, will also
be included to the extent consistent with the Transaction Accounting
Principles. The Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, the Estimated Closing Cash Amounts and the Estimated Closing Funded
Debt shall be used to calculate the Closing Purchase Price to be paid by Buyer
to HD Supply, on behalf of the Sellers, at the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, if HD Supplys good-faith estimate of the Closing Working Capital is
that the Closing Working Capital is equal to an amount that is not less than
the Lower Working Capital Collar Amount and is also not greater than the
Upper Working Capital Collar Amount, then the Estimated Adjustment Amount will
be zero.

(c) As promptly as reasonably possible and in any event within ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and
will provide to HD Supply, a written statement (the " _Post-Closing Statement_
"), setting forth the Closing Working Capital, the Adjustment Amount, the
Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt as of the close of business
on the Closing Date. The Post-Closing Statement shall set forth in reasonable
detail the Buyers calculations of such amounts in a manner consistent with
the Sample Closing Statement and shall be prepared in accordance with the
Transaction Accounting Principles.

 



23 (d) Within forty-five (45) days following receipt by HD Supply of the Post-
Closing Statement, HD Supply shall deliver written notice to Buyer of any
dispute HD Supply has with respect to the calculation, preparation or content
of the Post-Closing Statement (the " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if HD Supply does not deliver any Dispute Notice to Buyer
within such forty-five (45) day period, the Post-Closing Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto. The Dispute Notice shall
set forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on the Post-Closing Statement
that HD Supply disputes and (ii) the correct amount of such item; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that HD Supply may not dispute the accounting principles,
practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing the Post-Closing
Statement unless they are not in accordance with the Transaction Accounting
Principles. Upon receipt by Buyer of a Dispute Notice, Buyer and HD Supply
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute set forth therein. If
Buyer and HD Supply fail to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Dispute Notice (the " _Dispute Resolution Period_ "),
then Buyer and HD Supply jointly shall engage, within ten (10) Business Days
following the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period, Grant Thornton LLP
or, if Grant Thornton LLP is unavailable or conflicted, another nationally
recognized independent accounting firm selected jointly by HD Supply and
Buyer (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve any such dispute;
_provided_ that, if HD Supply and Buyer are unable to agree on the Independent
Accounting Firm, then each of HD Supply and Buyer shall select a nationally
recognized independent accounting firm, and the two (2) firms will mutually
select a third nationally recognized independent accounting firm to serve as
the Independent Accounting Firm. As promptly as practicable, and in any
event not more than fifteen (15) days following the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, Buyer and HD Supply shall each prepare and submit
a presentation detailing each Partys complete statement of proposed
resolution of each issue still in dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm.
Buyer and HD Supply shall instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to, as soon
as practicable after the submission of the presentations described in the
immediately preceding sentence and in any event not more than twenty (20)
days following such presentations, make a final determination, binding on the
Parties, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items that remain in
dispute as indicated in the Dispute Notice. With respect to each disputed
line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position of
either HD Supply or Buyer, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than
the lower, of the amounts advocated by HD Supply or Buyer, as applicable,
in their respective presentations to the Independent Accounting Firm
described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the scope of the disputes to
be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether any
disputed determinations of the Closing Working Capital, the Adjustment
Amount, the Closing Cash Amounts and the Closing Funded Debt were properly
calculated in accordance with the Transaction Accounting Principles. All fees
and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and HD Supply, on
the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed
items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed items so submitted. All
determinations made by the Independent Accounting Firm, and the Post-
Closing Statement, as modified by the Independent Accounting Firm, will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Parties agree that any
adjustment as determined pursuant to this Section 2.9(d) shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except as otherwise required by Law.

 



24 (e) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.9,
each of HD Supply and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with and make
available to each other and their respective Representatives all information,
records, data and working papers, in each case to the extent related to the
assets and liabilities of the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets,
Excluded Assets, Assumed Liabilities, Retained Liabilities, Business,
Purchased Companies (including their Subsidiaries), and shall permit access to
its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection
with the preparation and analysis of the Post-Closing Statement and the
resolution of any disputes thereunder.

 

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Base Purchase Price, _plus_
(i) the Closing Cash Amounts,  _plus_ (ii) the Adjustment Amount (which may
be a positive number, a negative number or zero), _minus_ (iii) the Closing
Funded Debt, in each case as finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.9(c)
and 2.9(d).

 

(g) If the Closing Purchase Price shall exceed the Final Purchase Price, then
HD Supply, on behalf of Sellers, shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in
cash equal to such excess to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyer to HD Supply;
or if the Final Purchase Price shall exceed the Closing Purchase Price, then
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess to
HD Supply, on behalf of Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by HD Supply to Buyer.
Any such payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of the date on
which the Adjustment Amount, Closing Cash Amounts and Closing Funded Debt are
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.9.

 

Section 2.10 _Purchase Price Allocation_. No later than sixty (60) days after
the date on which the Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.9, Buyer shall deliver to HD Supply a proposed allocation of the
Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9) and any other
items that are treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes
(including the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Company Equity
Interests and Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date (the " _Buyer s
Allocation_"). If HD Supply disagrees with Buyers Allocation, HD Supply may,
within thirty (30) days after delivery of Buyers Allocation, deliver a notice
(the " _HD Supply Allocation Notice_ ") to Buyer to such effect, specifying
those items as to which HD Supply disagrees and setting forth HD Supplys
proposed allocation. If the HD Supply Allocation Notice is duly delivered, HD
Supply and Buyer shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery,
use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (as
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.9) and any other items that are
treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes (including the Assumed
Liabilities). If HD Supply and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement, they
shall promptly thereafter cause the Independent Accounting Firm to resolve any
remaining disputes within fifteen (15) days. All fees and expenses relating to
the work, if any, to be performed by

 



25  the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand,
and HD Supply, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that
is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed items so
submitted. The allocation, as prepared by Buyer if no HD Supply Allocation
Notice has been timely given, or, if a HD Supply Allocation Notice has been
timely given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between HD Supply and
Buyer or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm (the " _Allocation_
"), shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto. No Seller, any
Affiliate of Seller or Buyer shall (and each shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to) take any position inconsistent with the Allocation on any
Tax Return or in any Tax Proceeding, in each case, except to the extent
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign
law).

Section 2.11 _Non-Assignment; Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer or convey any
Purchased Asset if an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance
thereof would be prohibited by Law or would, without the approval,
authorization or consent of, filing with, notification to, or granting or
issuance of any license, order, waiver or permit by, any Person
(collectively, " _Approvals_ "), (i) constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or (ii) be ineffective, void or voidable.

 

(b) Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or
cause to be obtained, any Approval (other than Regulatory Approvals, which
shall be governed by Section 5.1) required to sell, assign or transfer any
Purchased Asset. If such Approval is not obtained prior to Closing, until the
earlier of such time as such Approval or Approvals are obtained or three (3)
years following the Closing Date, then Sellers will cooperate with Buyer in
any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Sellers intended to both
(x) provide Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates, to the extent
reasonably practicable, the claims, rights and benefits of any such Purchased
Assets (including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
arrangement) and (y) cause Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates to bear all
costs and Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement to the extent that Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates
receive the rights and benefits of such Purchased Assets from and after the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates to, promptly pay, perform or
discharge when due any related Liability (other than any Liability for income,
franchise or similar Taxes) arising thereunder after the Closing Date to the
extent that Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates receive the rights and
benefits of such Purchased Assets from and after the Closing in accordance
with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections
2.11(a) or 2.11(b), the terms of Sections 2.11(a) and 2.11(b) shall in no
manner affect Buyers condition to close set forth in Section 7.2(d).

 



26 (c) Any Contract to be assigned, transferred and conveyed in accordance with
Section 2.4(a) that does not exclusively relate to the Business (each, a "
_Shared Contract_ ") shall be assigned, transferred and conveyed only with
respect to (and preserving the meaning of) those parts that relate to the
Business, to either Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer designated by Buyer, if so
assignable, transferrable or conveyable, or appropriately amended prior to, on
or after the Closing, so that Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to
the rights and benefits of those parts of the Shared Contract that relate to
the Business and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Buyer Portion of the Shared Contract
Liabilities_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall any
Person be required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in part,
any Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its terms
without obtaining one or more Approvals and (ii) if any Shared Contract
cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or cannot be
amended, without such Approval or Approvals, until the earlier of such time as
such Approval or Approvals are obtained and three (3) years following
the Closing Date, then Sellers will cooperate with Buyer to establish an
agency type or other similar arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Sellers
and Buyer intended to both (x) provide Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates,
to the extent reasonably practicable under such Shared Contract, the claims,
rights and benefits of those parts that relate to the Business (including by
means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement) and (y)
cause Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates to bear the costs and
Liabilities thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement to the extent that Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates receive
the rights and benefits of the parts of the Shared Contracts that relate to
the Business. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer will promptly pay,
perform or discharge when due any Liability (other than any Liability for
income, franchise or similar Taxes) arising thereunder after the Closing
Date to the extent that Buyer and/or its applicable Affiliates receive the
rights and benefits of the parts of such Shared Contracts that relate to the
Business.

 

(d) To the extent not prohibited by applicable Tax Laws (and to the extent
consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed to by Sellers and Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or 2.11(c)), Sellers and Buyer agree to treat and
report, and to cause their respective Affiliates to treat and report, on their
Tax Returns, the Purchased Assets that are subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.11 (the " _Non-Transferred Assets_ ") as assets owned by the
Buyer or its Affiliates from and after the Closing Date. Each of HD Supply and
Buyer agrees to notify the other promptly in writing if it determines that
such treatment (to the extent consistent with the relevant arrangement agreed
to by Sellers and Buyer pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or 2.11(c)) is not
permitted under applicable Tax Laws. Where such treatment is not permitted
under applicable Tax Laws, and subject to the terms of any relevant
arrangement agreed to by Sellers and Buyer pursuant to Section 2.11(b) or
2.11(c), the amount of the Liability for Taxes imposed on Sellers or any of
its Affiliates with respect to any Non-Transferred Asset for any Post-Closing
Period, if any, for which Buyer and its Affiliates are responsible shall be
calculated on a "with and without" basis. Sellers shall provide, and shall
cause their applicable Affiliates to provide, Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review the relevant portion of any applicable Tax Returns
relating to any Non-Transferred Assets (and accompanying schedules,
calculations and other reasonably requested work papers) as necessary
for determining such Tax Liability; _provided_ , that, in the case of Tax
Returns of any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (or of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or Tax group including any of them), Sellers
may, in lieu of delivering the Tax Returns, deliver to Buyer pro-forma
statements setting forth in sufficient detail the information relevant for
determining the relevant Tax Liability. If Sellers

 



27  and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement in respect of any dispute
concerning such Tax Liability, they shall promptly submit any such dispute for
resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm. All costs and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by HD Supply and Buyer.

Section 2.12  _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and each of its Affiliates shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as it is required (or entitled, in the case of
Taxes imposed pursuant to section 116 of the ITA) to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any federal,
state, local, provincial or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Buyer or any of its Affiliates and remitted to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such withheld and remitted amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the relevant Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Each of the Parties
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate the imposition of any
withholding Taxes.

material to the Business. To the Knowledge of Sellers, each parcel of Real
Property is occupied and utilized by a Seller, a Purchased Company or a

property for the purpose for which it is used as of the Closing

capital, as defined under the ITA, of each of (i) the Pro Canadian Equity

may be, for purposes of the ITA, do not differ from those that would have
been made between persons dealing at arms length for purposes of the ITA.

(w) There are no transactions or events that have resulted, and no
circumstances existing, which could result in the application to Pro Canadian
or its Subsidiary of sections 80, 80.01, 80.02, 80.03, 80.04 of the ITA or any
analogous provision of any comparable Law of any province or territory of
Canada.

(x) Neither Pro Canadian nor its Subsidiary has incurred any deductible outlay
or expense owing to a Person not dealing at arms length (for purposes of the
ITA) with Pro Canadian or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, the amount of
which would, in the absence of an agreement filed under paragraph 78(1)(b) of
the ITA, be included in Pro Canadian or such Subsidiarys income for Canadian
income tax purposes, as the case may be, for any taxation year or fiscal
period beginning on or after the Closing Date under paragraph 78(1)(a) of the
ITA or any analogous provision of any comparable Law of any province or
territory of Canada.

(a) Section 3.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of
each Benefit Plan and separately identifies as such each Purchased Company
Benefit Plan. Sellers have made available to Buyer correct and complete copies
of each Benefit Plan (or, to the extent that no such copy exists, an accurate
written description thereof). In addition, with respect to each
Purchased Company Benefit Plan, Sellers have made available to Buyer, to the
extent

 



43  applicable, (i) any related trust agreement or other funding instrument;
(ii) the currently effective summary plan description required under ERISA,
(iii) the most recent IRS determination letter; and (iv) the most recent (A)
Form 5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited financial statements and (C)
actuarial valuation reports.

 

(b) Each Benefit Plan in which Business Employees participate that is intended
to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its qualification
or is in the process of obtaining such a letter and, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, no event has occurred since the issuance of the determination
letters referred to in this clause (b) that could reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation of any such determination letters.

 

(c) Each Purchased Company Benefit Plan has been operated in material
compliance with its terms and applicable Law. All contributions, premiums and
expenses required to be made to or paid in respect of Business Employees
covered under a Benefit Plan, whether by Law or by the terms of the Benefit
Plan or any agreement relating thereto, have been timely made.

 

(d) Except as set forth on Section 3.15(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
no Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA, is a Multiemployer Plan or
is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section
3(40) of ERISA. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by any
Seller, any Purchased Company or any Subsidiary of a Purchased Company or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full when
due, and no condition exists that could reasonably be expected to result in
Buyer incurring a Liability under Title IV of ERISA by reason of any Benefit
Plan. No Benefit Plan subject to the minimum funding requirements of Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or any trust established thereunder
has failed to satisfy such requirements (determined without regard to
any waiver thereof), and all contributions required to be made with respect
thereto (whether pursuant to the terms of a Benefit Plan or otherwise) have
been timely made.

 

(e) Except as set forth on Section 3.15(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or together with
any other events) will (i) result in any payment that is the Liability of any
of the Purchased Companies becoming due to any Business Employee (as defined
herein), (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable by any of the Purchased
Companies to or in respect of any Business Employee or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.
No Purchased Company or Subsidiary of a Purchased Company is a party to any
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement that could result, separately
or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code by reason of the Transaction.

(f) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened claims
by or on behalf of any Purchased Company Benefit Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary covered under any Purchased Company Benefit Plan in their capacity
as such or otherwise involving any Purchased Company Benefit Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits).

 



44 (g) No Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits in respect of Business Employees
beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)
coverage mandated solely by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any
"pension plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, or (iii) benefits
the full costs of which are borne by the Business Employee or his
beneficiary.

(h) Each Purchased Company Benefit Plan has been maintained to the extent
applicable in material compliance with Section 409A and Section 457A of the
Code. No Purchased Company Benefit Plan is an International Benefit Plan.

 

(i) With respect to each International Benefit Plan: (i) all employer and
employee contributions required by Law or by the terms of the International
Benefit Plan have been made, or, if applicable, accrued, in accordance with
normal accounting practices; (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each
funded International Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for
any International Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any International Benefit Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations with respect to all current and former participants in such
International Benefit Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine required contributions to or in
respect of such International Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by
this Agreement will cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations; and (iii) each International Benefit Plan required
to be registered with any Governmental Entity has been registered and has
been maintained in good standing with all applicable Governmental Entities.

(j) Set forth on Section 3.15(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules is a
true, correct and complete list of each Collective Bargaining Agreement

their Affiliates. With respect to the Business or the Business Employees,
within the last two (2) years, there have been no actual, or to the Knowledge
of Sellers, threatened material arbitrations, Proceedings, grievances, labor
disputes, strikes, lockouts, slowdowns or work stoppages against or affecting
any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller.

 

(k) With respect to the Purchased Companies or the Current Business Employees,
no labor organization, union, works council, or group of employees of any

Supply shall promptly consult with each other to provide any necessary
information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the
other (or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by such Party (or in the
case of HD Supply, any filings made by any Seller) with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such Party (including in the case
of HD Supply, any other information supplied by any Seller) to,
or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.3 of this

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the other to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed written (or any material proposed oral)
communication with any such Governmental Entity. If any Party or any
Representative of any Party receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then
such Party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
promptly and after consultation with Buyer (in the case of any Seller
receiving such a request) and HD Supply (in the case of Buyer receiving such a
request), an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Except with
respect to Taxes, each of Buyer and HD Supply and its Representatives shall
be entitled to participate in any substantive meeting or telephone or other
conversations with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(or to make submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity. Except with respect to
Taxes, and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.3,
Buyer and HD Supply shall furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it (including in the case of HD Supply, all such
correspondence, filings and communications between any Seller) and any such
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Transaction or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and furnish the other with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity. Buyer and HD
Supply may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate
any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under

 



53  this Section 5.1 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance

valuation of or future plans for the Business, (ii) as necessary to comply
with contractual obligations, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

(c) Buyer and each Seller shall each use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity or any other
Person may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date);
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer shall not be obligated to, and nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to require Buyer to, proffer to, or agree to, sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold
separate or agree to sell, divest, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber
before or after the Closing, any material assets, material licenses, material
operations, material rights, material product lines, material businesses or

sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbering
by any Seller of any material assets of the Business or to any agreement by
any Seller to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to make any
material change (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on,

directly pertinent to such dispute, the Parties may not utilize this Section
5.4 but rather, absent agreement, must utilize the rules of discovery.

Section 5.5 _Publicity_. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
no Party nor any Affiliate or Representative of such Party shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or public announcement in respect
of this Agreement, the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer (in the case of a
press release or public announcement proposed to be issued or publicized by a
Seller) or HD Supply (in the case of a press release or public announcement
proposed to be issued or publicized by HD Supply) (which consent, in either
such case, shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as may be required by Law or stock exchange rules, and in any event a Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Party a
reasonable time in advance of such required disclosure.

Section 5.6 _Intercompany Accounts and Intercompany Arrangements_. Except as
set forth in Section 5.6 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, effective upon
the Closing, all intercompany accounts among any Seller and/or any Affiliate
of any Seller (excluding the Purchased Companies and the Subsidiaries of the
Purchased Companies), on the one hand, and the Business or the Purchased
Assets or the assets or other businesses of the Purchased Companies or the
Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies, on the other hand, will be voided,
cancelled, terminated and discharged. Any holder of a note or other evidence
of Indebtedness, obligation or account, if any, that is deemed voided,
cancelled, terminated and discharged in accordance with this Section 5.6 shall
surrender such note or other evidence, if any, to the obligor thereon. For
the avoidance of doubt, any agreements, understandings or Contracts entered
into by any Seller or any of its Affiliates, other than any Purchased Company,
with a third party, shall not be terminated pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 5.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, but in any event, not
less than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, make an offer of employment
commencing as of the Closing Date to each Current Business Employee listed on
Section 5.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, in a
substantially comparable job or position and in the same location as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and other than Current Business
Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, (i) at a
salary or wage level and bonus opportunity at least equal to the salary or
wage level and bonus opportunity to which such Current Business Employees were
entitled immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) subject to Section
5.7(f), with benefits, perquisites and other terms and conditions of
employment that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits,
perquisites and other terms and conditions that such Current Business
Employees were entitled to receive immediately prior to the Closing
Date (including, to the extent set forth on Section 3.15(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, any benefits pursuant to qualified and non-qualified
retirement and savings plans, medical, dental and pharmaceutical 

 



59  plans and programs, deferred compensation arrangements and equity-based and
incentive compensation plans). Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer
with respect to the transfer of Current Business Employees who are listed on
Section 5.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules. Sellers shall cause the
employment of each Current Business Employee listed on Section 5.7(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules who does not accept such offer of employment to
be terminated effective as of not more than five (5) Business Days following
the Closing Date. Those Current Business Employees listed on Section 5.7(a) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedules who accept such offers of employment with
Buyer and commence active employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
effective as of the Closing Date (or, if applicable, upon expiration of leave
or inactive status) shall be referred to herein as " _Transferred Business
Employees_ " and shall not be treated as Transferred Business Employees
unless, and shall remain employees of a Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
until, they commence active employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer.
Buyer acknowledges that the Current Business Employees (other than the
Current Business Employees located in Canada (all of whom are employed by HD
Supply Canada, Inc.)) are currently employed by HD Supply Management, Inc., an
Affiliate of the Purchased Companies. Seller acknowledges that the employment
offers to Current Business Employees shall be subject to Buyers standard
employee onboarding procedures, including satisfactory provision by such
Current Business Employees of work authorization and the execution of Buyers
standard employee Restrictive Covenants. For greater certainty, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not
make any offers of employment under this Section 5.7(a) to the Current
Business Employees located in Canada employed by Pro Canadian or one of its
Subsidiaries, but shall not be alleviated from any of Buyers other
obligations in this Section 5.7, including providing Current Business
Employees located in Canada employed by Pro Canadian or one of its
Subsidiaries with a salary, wage level and bonus opportunity consistent with
clause (i) of this Section 5.7(a).

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.7(a), Buyer agrees that: (i)
Buyer will cause the benefit plans applicable to the Transferred Business
Employees on and after the Closing Date (the " _Buyer s Plans_") to recognize
all previous service with the Sellers, Sellers Affiliates, and such entities
predecessor entities for the purpose of determining eligibility for and
entitlement to succeeding benefits, including for vesting but, except for
vacation, severance and short term disability purposes, not for benefit
accrual or benefit level determination purposes, to the extent such service
was recognized for such purpose by Sellers and their Affiliates as of
immediately before the Closing Date; (ii) Buyer will cause the Buyers Plans
to recognize all costs and expenses incurred by the Transferred Business
Employees (and their dependents and beneficiaries) up to (and including) the
Closing Date and the Seller COBRA Period where applicable, for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any
such benefit plan, and to waive any preexisting condition, evidence of
insurability or good health exclusions for the Transferred Business Employees
(exclusive of evidence of insurability requirements applicable to coverage
levels other than levels of coverage for which issuance is guaranteed); and
(iii) subject to Section 5.7(f), Buyer will assume all liabilities to provide
continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601
_et seq._ of ERISA to each Transferred Business Employee whose "qualifying
event" occurs on the Closing Date and to each of his or her "qualified
beneficiaries," with "qualifying event" and "qualified beneficiaries" defined
under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA.

 



60  Between the date hereof and the Closing, the Parties will use good faith
efforts to put in place substantially similar benefits for the Current
Business Employees located in Canada as such Current Business Employees were
entitled to receive immediately prior to the date hereof.

(c) Each Transferred Business Employee who is a participant in the HD Supply
401(k) Retirement Plan (the " _Seller Savings Plan_ ") shall cease to be an
active participant under such plan effective as of the Closing Date. Effective
as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to) have in
effect a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code and that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Buyer Savings Plan_ ") in
which, subject to Section 5.7(b), the Transferred Business Employees shall be
eligible to participate. For at least six (6) months following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause the Buyer Savings Plan to accept a contribution in
cash or, to the extent of any notes associated with the outstanding balance of
any loans to Transferred Business Employees that are not then in default, in
kind, attributable to any eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning
of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of the benefit of a Transferred Business
Employee under the Seller Savings Plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the
Closing, the terms and conditions of employment for any Transferred Business
Employee whose employment is subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement (i)
to which a Purchased Company or any Subsidiary of a Purchased Company is party
or (ii) which transfers by operation of applicable Law to Buyer or
its Affiliates, shall be governed by such Collective Bargaining Agreement
(with any modifications to account for terms and conditions of employment,
including provision of benefits, being provided by Buyer or its Affiliates)
until its expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its
terms and applicable Law.

(e) Seller (or any Affiliate of any Seller) will pay all Liabilities relating
to any unused vacation days, personal days, sick days or other paid time off
owing to any Business Employee upon the termination of such Business
Employees employment with any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller
in accordance with any personnel policies or Contracts applicable to such
employees and applicable Law.

(f) During the period, if any, from the Closing Date through December 31,
2015 (the " _Seller COBRA Period_ "), neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall be required to provide in respect of any Transferred Business Employee
any benefits subject to continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of
the Code or Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA. During the Seller COBRA Period,
Seller shall retain all liabilities to provide continuation coverage pursuant
to Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA to each
Transferred Business Employee whose "qualifying event" occurs on the Closing
Date and to each of his or her "qualified beneficiaries," with "qualifying
event" and "qualified beneficiaries" defined under Section 4980B of the Code
and Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA, provided that (x) Buyer shall remit to HD
Supply, within five (5) Business Days following each calendar month ending
following the Closing Date, an amount equal to the excess of (A) 102% of the
applicable premium (within the meaning of Section 4980B of the Code and
Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA) in respect of any calendar month (or portion
thereof) ending with or during the Seller COBRA Period for which a

 



61  Transferred Business Employee (or his or her qualified beneficiary) duly
elected such continuation coverage over (B) any amount previously remitted by
Buyer to HD Supply pursuant to this Section 5.7(f), and (y) Buyer may (or may
cause an Affiliate to) withhold from the wages of any Transferred Business
Employee in respect of whom such continuation coverage is elected an amount
equal to, in respect of any portion of the Seller COBRA Period for which such
Transferred Business Employee (or his or her qualified beneficiary, as the
case may be) duly elects such continuation coverage, what would have been the
employee cost in respect of such coverage under the applicable Benefit Plan
had coverage continued in respect of such Transferred Business Employee (and
his or her qualified beneficiary, as the case may be) during such period on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before
the Closing Date. Sellers shall not (and shall cause their Affiliates to not)
otherwise impose any cost on Transferred Business Employees (or their
respective qualified beneficiaries) for such continuation coverage in respect
of the Seller COBRA Period; _provided_ , _however_ , in addition to the
payment required by Section 5.7(f)(x) above, Buyer shall remit to Sellers
within ten (10) days following the end of each calendar month during the
Seller COBRA Period, the excess, if any, of the aggregate dollar amount of
claims incurred by the Transferred Business Employees and/or "qualified
beneficiaries" covered by COBRA and paid under any Benefit Plan of the Sellers
pursuant to COBRA and this Section 5.7(f), over the aggregate amount of
premiums remitted by Buyer in payment of such COBRA coverage pursuant to this
Section 5.7(f). Not later than five (5) days after the Closing Date, Sellers
shall inform Buyer, in respect of each Transferred Business Employee (and his
or her qualified beneficiary), of the cost described in respect of such person
under Section 5.7(f)(x)(A) and Section 5.7(f)(y), respectively, and provide
Buyer with such supporting information in respect of such costs as Buyer
shall reasonably request.

(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 10.4, the provisions of this
Section 5.7 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and no
current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for any
purpose.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Current
Business Employee who is not employed by Pro Canadian or a Subsidiary of Pro
Canadian and who is not actively at work as of the Closing (by reason of any
leave or absence whatsoever, including any medical, disability, workers
compensation, vacation, sick, personal, or other leave, regardless of
the duration of such leave) (" _Inactive Current Business Employees_ ") shall
not be treated as a Current Business Employee or Transferred Business Employee
for purposes of Section 5.7 unless and until such employee is able to
return to active employment and the active performance of his or her normal
job duties, provided that such date occurs before the one-year anniversary of
the Closing Date (" _Return Date_ "). For purposes of clarity, Inactive
Current Business Employees shall not receive offers of employment under
Section 5.7 until their Return Date.

 



62 Section 5.8 _Financial Obligations_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within thirty (30)
days) following the Closing, Buyer shall at its sole expense (i) arrange for
substitute letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and other obligations
to replace the outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and
other contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of HD Supply,
any other Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Purchased Companies and Subsidiaries thereof) in connection with or relating
to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, in each case
that are listed on Section 5.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (together,
the " _Guarantees_ ") or (ii) assume all obligations under any Guarantee not
so replaced. Buyer further agrees that to the extent any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller incurs any cost or expense, or is required to make
any payment, in connection with such Guarantees on or after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless such Seller or such Affiliate against, and
reimburse such Seller or such Affiliate for, any and all amounts paid,
including costs or expenses in connection with such Guarantees.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within thirty (30)
days) following the Closing, HD Supply shall at its sole expense (i) arrange
for substitute letters of credit, surety bonds, guarantees and other
obligations to replace the outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds,
guarantees and other contractual obligations entered into by or on behalf of a
Purchased Company or any Subsidiary of a Purchased Company which are unrelated
to the Business (together, the " _Purchased Company Guarantees_ ") or (ii)
assume all obligations under any Purchased Company Guarantee not so replaced.
HD Supply further agrees that to the extent Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer
incurs any cost or expense, or is required to make any payment, in connection
with such Purchased Company Guarantees on or after the Closing, HD Supply
shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer or such Affiliate against, and
reimburse Buyer or such Affiliate for, any and all amounts paid, including
costs or expenses in connection with such Purchased Company Guarantees.

Section 5.9 _Use of Names and Trademarks_. Except as set forth in this
Section 5.9 and Section 5.15, the Parties acknowledge that Sellers and their
Affiliates are retaining all rights with respect to the HD Supply Marks. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any
event within six (6) months after the Closing Date, Buyer will, at its own
expense, remove any and all exterior signs and other identifiers located on or
attached to the Purchased Companies property, building, vehicles, signs or
premises that refer or pertain to or that include the HD Supply Marks.
Additionally, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in
any event within six (6) months after the Closing Date, Buyer will remove from
all of the Purchased Companies publicly distributed or publicly accessible
letterhead, envelopes, invoices, supplies, labels, product packaging and
inserts, web site publications, promotional materials, marketing collateral,
advertisements, and other communications media of any kind, all references to
the HD Supply Marks. Except with respect to the exhaustion of Inventory in the
ordinary course of business during the eight (8) month period following the
Closing to the extent Buyer is in compliance with the foregoing in this
Section 5.9, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither Buyer or its
Affiliates nor any of the Purchased Companies or Subsidiaries of the Purchased
Companies shall have any right to use any of the HD Supply Marks or any
derivative thereof after the conclusion of the six (6)-month period
immediately following the Closing Date (other than permissible fair use).

 



63 Section 5.10 _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Business, the Purchased Companies,
the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the
Assumed Liabilities, and the operations and assets and Liabilities in respect
thereof, shall cease to be insured by insurance policies of any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller or by any of their self-insured programs, and, subject
to Section 5.10(b), neither Buyer nor its Affiliates (including the Business,
the Purchased Companies and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies) shall
have any access, right, title or interest to or in any such insurance policies
(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to
proceeds) to cover the Business, the Purchased Companies, the Subsidiaries of
the Purchased Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, or the
operations or assets or Liabilities in respect thereof.

(b) HD Supply and its Affiliates (including the other Sellers) will keep each
of the insurance policies set forth on Section 5.10(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the " _Listed HD Insurance Policies_ "),
or suitable replacements therefor, in full force and effect until the Closing.
With respect to claims relating to acts, omissions, events or circumstances
relating to the Business that occurred or existed prior to the Closing that
are Assumed Liabilities and that are covered by the Listed HD Insurance
Policies (" _Pre-Closing Claims_ "), HD Supply and its Affiliates agree to
cooperate with Buyer and to make the benefits of the Listed HD Insurance
Policies available to Buyer (subject to the terms and conditions of the Listed
HD Insurance Policies) and continue, from and after the Closing, to process
such Pre-Closing Claims in the ordinary course of business in substantially
the same manner as similar claims were processed prior to the Closing. Buyer
expressly acknowledges and agrees that Buyer shall be responsible
to reimburse HD Supply and its Affiliates with respect to any payments made
by HD Supply or any of its Affiliates on account of any such Pre-Closing
Claims up to any deductible required under the terms of the applicable
insurance policy, with the exception of workers compensation claims relating
to the Business that occurred or existed prior to Closing. With respect to
Buyers obligation to reimburse HD Supply and its Affiliates for any such Pre-
Closing Claims, HD Supply and Buyer agree that (i) HD Supply will invoice
Buyer on a monthly basis for the amounts paid by HD Supply and its Affiliates
with appropriate supporting details and (ii) Buyer agrees to pay the amount
reflected on such invoices as promptly as practicable and in any event with
fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of any such invoice with appropriate
supporting details. HD Supply shall (i) provide Buyer with advance notice of
any payments or settlements in excess of $25,000 relating to any Pre-Closing
Claim, and (ii) will not cause any Pre-Closing Claims settlements in excess of
$25,000 to be made without the prior written consent of Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If Buyer does not provide
such consent in accordance with the immediately preceding clause (ii) within
ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice from HD Supply of such
payment, then HD Supply may settle such Pre-Closing Claim without Buyers
consent. In the event that (i) HD Supply or any of its Affiliates receive any
proceeds from the Listed HD Insurance Policies with respect to any Pre-Closing
Claim thereunder and (ii) such Pre-Closing Claim has been paid by Buyer, HD
Supply shall and shall cause its Affiliates to promptly pay or reimburse Buyer
with

 



64  respect to the amount so paid by Buyer in accordance with this Section
5.10(b) net of any unreimbursed amount paid by any member of the HDS Group.
Following the Closing, HD Supply shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the other Sellers) not to, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise
eliminate insurance coverage under any of the Listed HD Insurance Policies
with respect to acts, omissions, events or circumstances relating to
activities of the Business occurring prior to the Closing. Conditioned upon
the Closing, with respect to any out-of-pocket costs incurred by any member of
the HDS Group after the Closing Date in connection with the Whitley
Contracting claim set forth on Section 3.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
under "Pending Civil Cases" Item 6, Buyer will reimburse such member of the
HDS Group for fifty percent (50%) of such costs up to $1,000,000, such that
Buyers total reimbursement obligation under this sentence is capped at
$500,000 (the " _Whitley Costs_ "). The HDS Group will invoice Buyer monthly
following the Closing for such Whitley Costs; Buyer will reimburse such member
of the HDS Group within thirty (30) days following the later of (i) receipt
of such invoice and (ii) the date such Whitley Costs are paid by the HDS
Group.

 

Section 5.11 _Payments_.

 

(a) HD Supply shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate (including any
other Seller) to, promptly pay or deliver to Buyer (or its designated
Affiliates) any monies or checks to the extent related to the Business, the
Purchased Companies or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies that have
been sent to HD Supply or any of its Affiliates (including any other Seller)
after the Closing Date by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties
of the Business, the Purchased Companies or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased
Companies to the extent that they are in respect of a Purchased Company Equity
Interest, Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability hereunder.

(b) Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, promptly pay or
deliver to HD Supply (or its designated Affiliates) any monies or checks that
have been sent to Buyer (including the Business, the Purchased Companies and
the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies) after the Closing Date to the
extent that they are not due to the Business, a Purchased Company or a
Subsidiary of a Purchased Company, or are in respect of an Excluded Asset or
Retained Liability hereunder.

 

Section 5.12 _Pre-Closing Restructuring_. Prior to the Closing, HD Supply will
cause its Affiliates, including the other Sellers, the Purchased Companies
and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies, to complete the transactions
substantially as described on Section 5.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.
The transactions contemplated by Section 5.12 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules are referred to as the " _Pre-Closing Restructuring_."

Section 5.13 _Non-Solicitation of Employees; Non-Competition_.

(a) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, as to any Business Employee (1) who became
employed by Buyer or a Subsidiary of a Buyer, (2) who was offered employment
by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer or (3) whose employment with a Seller or an
Affiliate of a Seller was terminated on or after the date of this Agreement
and before or on the date of Closing (a " _Covered Person_ "), HD

 



65  Supply agrees that none of HD Supply or any of its Affiliates (including the
other Sellers) will solicit for employment or hire any Covered Person;
_provided_ that HD Supply and its Affiliates shall not be precluded from
soliciting, or taking any other action (including hiring), with respect to any
such individual (i) whose employment with Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer has
been terminated by Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer; or (ii) who is a
"functional" or "corporate" employee who voluntarily terminated employment
with Buyer or a Subsidiary of Buyer at least six (6) months prior to HD Supply
or one of its Affiliates commencing employment discussions with such
individual.

(b) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Buyer, HD Supply agrees that none of HD Supply or any of
its Affiliates (including the other Sellers) shall engage in the Business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall preclude HD Supply or any
of its Affiliates from:

(i) owning three percent (3%) or less of the outstanding equity securities of
any Person if such equity securities are available to the general public on a
national securities exchange;

(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an interest in any Person
(or its successor) or business that is engaged in a business activity that
would otherwise violate this Section 5.13(b) (a " _Competing Business_ ") so
long as the revenues from the Competing Business constitute less than 25% of
the consolidated revenues of such Person or business (measured for the four
calendar quarters prior to the execution of the purchase agreement), but if
the revenues from the Competing Business constitute between 10% and 25% of
the consolidated revenues of such acquired business or Person during such four
calendar quarters, HD Supply and each applicable Affiliate of HD Supply will
be required to divest the Competing Business within 12 months of the closing
of the acquisition; or

(iii) continuing to engage in the Retained Businesses and any
reasonable expansion of such Retained Businesses. For purposes of this
Section 5.13(b)(iii), "reasonable expansion" shall mean adding to product mix
for categories that would be natural extensions of existing products offerings
of the Retained Businesses (i.e., growth with existing and related customers
and vendors of the Retained Businesses). " _Retained Businesses_ " means the
following businesses conducted by the HDS Group as of the Closing Date:

 

A. the facilities maintenance business, consisting of providing to apartment

Section 5.14 _Misallocated Assets_. If, following the Closing, any right,
property or asset not forming part of the Business is found to have been
transferred to Buyer in error, either directly or indirectly (including as a
result of the Pre-Closing Restructuring), Buyer shall transfer, or shall cause
its Affiliates (including the Purchased Companies and Subsidiaries of the
Purchased Companies) to transfer, at no cost, such right, property or asset
(and any related liability) as soon as practicable to the applicable Seller
indicated by HD Supply. If, following the Closing, any right, property or
asset forming part of the Business is found to have been retained by any
Seller in error, either directly or indirectly (including as a result of the
Pre-Closing Restructuring), HD Supply shall transfer, or shall cause the
other applicable Seller to transfer, at no cost, such right, property or
asset (and any related liability) as soon as practicable to Buyer or an
Affiliate (including a Purchased Company or Subsidiary of a Purchased Company)

Section 5.15 _Retained Trademark License_.

 

(a) HD Supply, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants each
Purchased Company and each Subsidiary of a Purchased Company, as of the
Closing Date, a non-exclusive, sublicensable (for use in connection with the
operation of the Business but not for the independent use by third parties),
and royalty-free license to the HD Supply Marks and the "Pro Value"
mark (collectively, the " _Retained Marks_ ") for an eight (8) month
transitional period, in each case, for use solely in connection with the
packaging, marketing, sale, and distribution of Inventory in the operation of
the Business as currently conducted (the " _Licensed Field of Use_ "). The
rights granted pursuant to this Section 5.15 are collectively referred to
herein as the " _Retained Trademark License_."

 



67 (b) Each of the Parties hereby agrees that the Purchased Companies and
Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies shall use (and Buyer and its
Affiliates shall cause Purchased Companies and the Subsidiaries of the
Purchased Companies to use) commercially reasonable efforts to sell and
distribute the Inventory as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing and within the eight-month transitional license period. In no event
shall the Purchased Companies or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies
continue to use any of the Retained Marks (except for permissible fair use)
after the expiration or termination of the eight (8)-month transitional
period.

(c) Buyer and its Affiliates acknowledge that the goodwill and all other
rights in and associated with the Retained Marks (as well as any additional
goodwill generated from or by the transitional use or exploitation of the same
under Section 5.9 and this Section 5.15) shall vest in HD Supply and its
Affiliates and that it is the intention of the Parties that all such rights
will at all times hereafter and for all purposes remain vested in HD Supply
and its Affiliates. In the event that any such rights at any time accrue to
the Purchased Companies or the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies by
operation of law or howsoever otherwise, the Purchased Companies and the
Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies will, at the expense of HD Supply,
take reasonable actions and execute assignment documents as reasonably
requested for the vesting of such rights in HD Supply and its Affiliates.
Neither Buyer and its Affiliates nor the Purchased Companies and the
Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies shall take any action hereunder that
would reasonably be expected to impair the value of or goodwill associated
with the Retained Marks. The Purchased Companies and the Subsidiaries of the
Purchased Companies shall use (and Buyer and its Affiliates shall cause
Purchased Companies and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies to use)
the Retained Marks in accordance with the presentation of such Marks prior to
the Closing Date. The Purchased Companies and the Subsidiaries of the
Purchased Companies shall in using the Retained Marks hereunder maintain the
level of quality of products and services previously provided in the conduct
of the Business under the Retained Marks prior to the Closing Date. When
entering into or conducting contractual relationships involving any use or
disposition of any Inventory bearing any Retained Mark, the Purchased
Companies and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Companies shall (and Buyer and

Supply. Buyer shall promptly provide (or cause to be provided) to HD Supply
any information reasonably requested by HD Supply to facilitate the
preparation and filing of any Tax Returns described in this Section 6.3(a)

Supply. If, within twenty five (25) days following Buyers receipt of a Seller
Tax Return, Buyer notifies HD Supply of any objection to any item on such Tax
Return, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such objection.
If, after consulting in good faith, the parties are unable to resolve such
objection in a mutually agreeable manner within ten (10) days, such
objection(s) shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm in

Return to reflect any comments that are reasonably requested by HD Supply and

due date thereof (taking into account any extensions). Buyer shall not amend
or revoke any such Straddle Period Separate Tax Return (or any notification or
election relating thereto) without the prior written consent of HD Supply
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except to the extent such amendment or revocation relates solely to a Post-
Closing Period and does not affect Sellers indemnification obligations under
Section 6.1.

 



74 Section 6.4 _Certain Tax Refunds and Credits_. Sellers shall be entitled to
any refunds or credits of or against any Taxes for which Sellers are
responsible under Section 6.1 to the extent not taken into account as part of

specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing
Authority.

contained in Article IV of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct
or Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any
of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, and such

breach or failure to perform has not been cured by the earlier of (i) the date
that is thirty (30) calendar days after the date that HD Supply has notified
Buyer of such untruth, inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform and (ii) the
Outside Date; _provided_ that no Seller is then in breach of any of its

contained in Article III of this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct

covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date or (ii) Buyer
if Buyers failure to perform any material covenant or obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to

(b) The representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement

warranties set forth in Section 4.1 (Organization, Standing and Power),
Section 4.2 (Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability) and Section
4.5 (Brokers) (collectively, the " _Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ")
shall survive indefinitely. Written notice of a claim must be given by HD
Supply to Buyer in accordance with the provisions hereof prior to
the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties.

(c) The covenants and agreements that contemplate actions to be taken or not
taken or obligations in effect after the Closing shall survive in accordance
with their terms. This Section 9.1(c) shall not limit any covenant or

81  Agreement that by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing, and
shall not extend the applicability of any covenant or agreement of the Parties
contained in this Agreement that by its terms relates only to a period
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing.

Section 9.2 _Indemnification by Sellers_. 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article IX and except with respect to
indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by Article
VI), effective as of and after the Closing, Sellers shall jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and each
of the Buyers and such Affiliates respective officers, directors, agents,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ "),
from and against any and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, to the extent arising out of or resulting from (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in Article
III (other than the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.14)
made as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date (in each case, without
giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect," "materiality," "Knowledge" or
similar qualifications); (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of any
Seller contained in this Agreement; (iii) any Retained Liabilities to the
extent related to the Business; and (iv) any Retained Liabilities to the
extent unrelated to the Business.

 

(b) Except with respect to indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed
exclusively by Article VI), notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary:

(i) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify, defend or hold harmless any
Buyer Indemnified Party against, or reimburse any Buyer Indemnified Party
for, any Covered Losses pursuant to any claim under Section 9.2(a)(i), (A) to
the extent that such Covered Losses are reflected, recorded or included in
Working Capital on the Post-Closing Statement; (B) except with respect to the
Fundamental Representations, if the entire amount of Losses relating to such
claim is less than $25,000 (the " _Per-Claim Threshold_ "), _provided_ that in
the case of any group of claims arising out of a common or related set of
facts, events or circumstances, such claims shall be aggregated for purposes
of determining whether the Per-Claim Threshold has been exceeded, and Covered
Losses less than the Per-Claim Threshold shall not be included in the Covered
Losses that will be cumulated to determine when the Deductible is attained;
and (C) except with respect to the Fundamental Representations, until the
aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Parties Covered Losses under
Section 9.2(a)(i) exceeds $6,187,500 (the " _Deductible_ "), after which
Sellers shall be obligated for all the Buyer Indemnified Parties Covered
Losses under Section 9.2(a)(i) to the extent such losses are in excess of the
Deductible, subject to Sections 9.2(b)(i)(A), 9.2(b)(i)(B) and 9.2(b)(ii) and
any other applicable limitations set forth herein; and

 

(ii) the cumulative indemnification obligation of Sellers under Section
9.2(a)(i) (other than indemnification obligations related to the Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.8(b) (Sufficiency and Condition of Assets)) shall in no event exceed
$99,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 



82 (c) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, Sellers shall
not have any indemnification obligation under this Agreement (other than
under Section 9.2(a)(iv)) for an amount greater than the Purchase Price.

 

Section 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

Subject to the provisions of this Article IX and except with respect to
indemnification for Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by Article
VI), effective at and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Seller, its Affiliates and each of such Sellers and such
Affiliates respective officers, directors, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), from and
against any and all Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties to the extent arising out of or resulting from (a) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in Article VI (in
each case, without giving effect to any "Buyer Material Adverse Effect,"
"materiality," "Knowledge" or similar qualifications); (b) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement; and (c) any
Assumed Liability.

Section 9.4 _Procedures_. 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the Party or Parties liable
for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any
pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to such
right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail, to the extent then
known by the Indemnified Party, the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ that neither the
failure to provide such notice nor any deficiency in such notice shall release
the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually materially
prejudiced by such failure, it being agreed that notices for claims in respect
of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified
in Section 9.1 for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3, the Indemnifying
Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within
thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim
stating that the Indemnifying Party will assume the defense and control of
such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party), to assume
the defense and control of such Third Party Claim (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Party). Notwithstanding an election to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate co-counsel and to participate in the defense as counsel of
record, if applicable, in such action or proceeding (and the parties shall
jointly control the defense), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel,
but only if (i) there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party

 



83  in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim that would make
representation by the same counsel or the counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party inappropriate, (ii) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or (iii) such Third Party Claim
related to or otherwise arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory
enforcement Action. In any other event not set forth in the previous
sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense. In any event, the
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party and their counsel shall cooperate in
the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this Article IX and keep such
Persons informed of all developments relating to any such Third Party Claims,
and provide copies of all relevant correspondence and documentation relating
thereto. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense and control of
any Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.4(b), the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to assume and control such defense, but the Indemnifying
Party may nonetheless participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense. Buyer or HD Supply, as the case
may be, shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third
Party Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and
witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party
Claim, it shall not be authorized to consent to a settlement or compromise of,
or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the
consent of any Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnified Party is given a
full and complete release of any and all Liability by all relevant parties to
such claim or demand, (ii) the damages payable under the settlement are
limited only to monetary payments for which the Indemnified Party is fully
indemnified by the Indemnifying Party and (iii) such Third Party Claim does
not involve any injunctive relief or finding or admission of any violation of
Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party. No Indemnified
Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnified Party
conducts the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.4(b)
(whether as sole, lease or co-counsel), the Indemnifying Party will remain
responsible for any and all Covered Losses that the Indemnified Party
may incur or suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the
nature of or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in
this Article IX.

 

Section 9.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and
agree that, following the Closing, except in the case of willful misconduct
and fraud, the indemnification provisions of Article VI, Section 9.2, Section
9.3 and the specific performance provisions of Section 10.6 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of Sellers and Buyer, respectively, for any Covered
Losses (including any Covered Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that any
Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement by any Party, or any failure by any Party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents.

 



84 Section 9.6 _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect to
each indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, the amount of
Covered Losses shall be net of (a) any third-party insurance or indemnity,
contribution or similar proceeds that have been recovered (net of any costs
incurred to recover such proceeds) by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (it being agreed
that if third-party insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar
proceeds in respect of such facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party
subsequent to the Indemnifying Partys making of an indemnification payment in
satisfaction of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall
be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent of the
indemnification payment made), and the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause
its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under
all insurance and indemnity, contribution or similar provisions covering such
Covered Loss to the same extent as it would if such Covered Loss were not
subject to indemnification hereunder, and (b) any net Tax benefit actually
realized by an Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the
Covered Losses giving rise to such claim for indemnification. Upon making any
payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to
this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any
third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party. In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers
from a third party any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Agreement (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, any such case addressed by Sections 6.5(d) and
6.5(e)), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of
the expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of
the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or
on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter, and (ii) any
amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any
claim arising out of such matter.

Section 9.7 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including this Article IX), no Party
shall be liable to any other Party or its Affiliates for, whether in contract,
tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise, at law or in
equity, and Covered Losses shall not include, any amounts for consequential,
indirect, special or punitive damages, except to the extent such damages were
reasonably foreseeable or were awarded against an Indemnified Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim, or any damages based on multiples of
earnings or revenues (other than, in the case of multiples of earnings or
revenues, any damages resulting from a breach of Section 3.6).

 

ARTICLE X.

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

Section 10.1 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement, along with the Seller Disclosure Schedules and
Buyer Disclosure Schedules, constitute the entire agreement and understanding
among the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating

 



85  to such subject matter. No Party shall be liable or bound to any other Party
in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such
subject matter except as specifically set forth herein and therein.

Section 10.2 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and
obligations hereunder may be assigned or transferred by any Party (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of HD Supply
(in the case of a proposed assignment or transfer by Buyer) or by Buyer (in
the case of a proposed assignment or transfer by a Seller). Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section 10.2 shall be void. Subject to the two
preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Buyer may (x) assign all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement, or delegate all or any portion of
its obligations under this Agreement, in each case with reference to all or
any portion of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or any of the
Purchased Companies or their Subsidiaries, to any of its Affiliates without HD
Supplys consent and (y) grant a security interest and/or collateral
assignment to its lenders of its rights and benefits arising under this
Agreement; _provided_ , that no such assignment or delegation or grant of a
security interest will release Buyer from any of its Liabilities or
obligations hereunder.

Section 10.3 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties
hereto. By an instrument in writing, Buyer, on the one hand, or HD Supply, on
the other hand, may waive compliance by any Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
with any term or provision of this Agreement that such Party was or is
obligated to comply with or perform. Such waiver or failure to insist on
strict compliance with such term or provision shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure of
compliance.

 

Section 10.4 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for Section 9.2 and
Section 9.3, which are intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the
Parties specified therein, this Agreement, together with the other Transaction
Documents and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto are not intended
to confer in or on behalf of any Person not a party to this Agreement (and
their successors and assigns) any rights, benefits, causes of action or
remedies with respect to the subject matter or any provision hereof.

 

Section 10.5 _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to
any Party hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if
in writing and delivered by hand, courier or overnight delivery service, or

Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any

 



87  other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction.

 

Section 10.7 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision
or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware. In addition, each of the Parties hereto (a) submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts located in Wilmington,
Delaware or the federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, in the event
that any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) arises out of this
Agreement or the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby;
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (c)
agrees that it will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
Transaction or the other transactions contemplated hereby in any court other
than the state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware or the federal courts
located in Wilmington, Delaware; and (d) agrees that it will not seek to
assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, that any such Proceeding
(i) is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) should be transferred or
removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts, (iii) should be
stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any court other
than one of the above-named courts, or (iv) that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by the above-named courts.
Each Party hereto agrees that service of process upon such Party in any such
Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
10.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 10.7, a Party may
commence any Action in any court other than the above-named courts solely for
the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named
courts relating to any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 10.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL

next succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 10.13 _Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that each of King and Spalding
LLP (" _K andS_") and Stikeman Elliott LLP (" _SE_ ") has acted as counsel to
each of the Purchased Companies and Sellers in connection with the negotiation
of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Buyer hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Purchased
Companies to consent and agree to, each of KandS and SE representing Sellers and
any of their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Parties_ ") after the
Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Purchased Companies). In connection with the foregoing, Buyer
hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause
the Purchased Companies to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any conflict
of interest arising from or in connection with (i) each of KandSs or SEs, as
the case may be, prior representation of the Purchased Companies or the
Business and (ii) each of KandSs or SEs, as the case may be, representation
of the Seller Parties prior to and after the Closing. Buyer represents that
Buyers attorney has explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications
and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict against KandS and
SE, as the case may be, and Buyers consent with respect to this waiver is
fully informed.

 

(b) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Purchased Companies, that all pre-Closing communications
subject to any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or
other similar protection for the benefit of the Seller Parties, in any form or
format whatsoever between or among KandS or SE (as the case may be), on
one hand, and the Purchased Companies, the Business or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on the
other hand, that relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Privileged Deal
Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by
the Seller Parties, shall be controlled by Sellers on behalf of the Seller
Parties and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or any Purchased Company.
For the avoidance of doubt, any attorney-client privilege, attorney work-
product protection or other similar protection in any form or format
whatsoever between or among KandS or SE (as the case may be), on the one hand,
and any Purchased Company, any Subsidiary of a Purchased Company, the Business
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
other representatives, on the other hand, that do not relate to the

 



90  negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall belong to the Purchased Companies and their
Subsidiaries and shall be controlled, and may be waived, only by the
Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries and shall not be controlled,
waived, claimed or used by any Seller Party (other than a Purchased Company or
a Subsidiary of a Purchased Company) following the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer or a
Purchased Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than any Seller,
on the other hand, Buyer or such Purchased Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar protection
for the benefit of the Seller Parties, Buyer or the Purchased Companies to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor any Company may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of Sellers, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If Buyer or a Purchased Company is
legally required by government order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy
of all or a portion of the Privileged Deal Communications following the
Closing, Buyer shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify Sellers in
writing (including by making specific reference to this Section) so that
Sellers can seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, at the Seller Parties expense, to assist therewith.

(d) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by KandS or SE that
contain Privileged Deal Communications constitutes property of its clients,
only the Seller Parties shall hold such property rights and KandS or SE, as the
case may be, shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any Privileged Deal
Communications contained in such files or other materials or any other
Privileged Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between KandS or SE (as the case may be), on the one hand, and the Purchased
Companies, on the other hand.

 

(e) Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Purchased
Companies not to, use any Privileged Deal Communications against the Seller
Parties in connection with any dispute between Sellers, on the one hand, and
Buyer and the Purchased Companies, on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) This Section 10.13 is for the benefit of KandS and SE, and each of KandS and
SE is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 10.13. This Section
10.13 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this Section 10.13 may be amended,
waived or modified, without the prior written consent of KandS and SE, as the
case may be.

 

Section 10.14 _Preparation of Agreement_. Each of the Parties acknowledges
that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout
all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that
it has executed the same with consent and upon the advice of said independent
counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting
and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and
this Agreement shall not be construed as if prepared by one of the Parties,
but rather according to its fair meaning as a whole, as if all Parties had
prepared it. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against the party
that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.
