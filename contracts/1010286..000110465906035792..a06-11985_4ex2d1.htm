part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

  

### (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thereby
become a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of First Avenue.

  

### (d) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all Stock Options (as defined
in Section 5.13(c)) outstanding (whether vested or unvested) at the Effective
Time under each FiberTower Plan (as defined in Section 3.11(b)) shall be
assumed by First Avenue in accordance with Section 5.13.

  

SECTION 2.2 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION_.

  

### (a) _Exchange Procedures_. At or prior to the Effective Time, First
Avenue shall deposit with its transfer agent or such other party as may be
reasonably satisfactory to First Avenue and FiberTower (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of the holders of FiberTower Common
Shares, certificates representing First Avenue Common Shares in an amount
necessary to effect the conversion of FiberTower Common Shares into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a). First Avenue
shall make sufficient funds available to the Exchange Agent from time to time
as needed to pay cash in respect of (i) dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.2(b) and (ii) fractional shares in

     

   

### 

  

### accordance with Section 2.2(d). Promptly after the Effective Time, but in
no event later than five business days thereafter, First Avenue shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate as of
the Effective Time (other than holders of a Certificate in respect
of Excluded FiberTower Common Shares or Dissenting FiberTower Shares), (i)
a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery of the Certificates shall
be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, such letter
of transmittal to be in such form and to have such other provisions as
First Avenue may reasonably determine, and (ii) instructions for exchanging
the Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration to which such holder
shall be entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Subject to Section
2.2(g), upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a
certificate representing that number of whole First Avenue Common Shares that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and (ii)
a check in the aggregate amount (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings) of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares determined
in accordance with Section 2.2(d) plus (B) any cash dividends and any other
dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.2. The Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable (for fractional shares, dividends or otherwise)
upon surrender of any Certificate. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of FiberTower Common Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time, but is
not registered in the transfer records of FiberTower, the Merger
Consideration may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such FiberTower Common Shares is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. If any certificate for First Avenue Common Shares is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange
that the Person (as defined in Section 8.9) requesting such exchange shall
pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates for First Avenue Common Shares in a name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of First Avenue and the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

  

### (b) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by First Avenue in respect of
First Avenue Common Shares, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all First Avenue Common Shares payable as Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions
so declared in respect of such First Avenue Common Shares shall be paid to
any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be issued or paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes that may be
required to be deducted therefrom, to the holder of the certificates
representing whole First Avenue Common Shares issued in exchange for such
Certificate, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date that is at or after the

     

   

### 

  

### Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of surrender of
such Certificate and not previously paid to such holder and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable
with respect to such whole First Avenue Common Shares with a record date at
or after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.
No interest shall be payable with respect to any amounts to be paid under
this Section 2.2(b). For purposes of dividends or other distributions in
respect of First Avenue Common Shares, all First Avenue Common Shares payable
as Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger shall be issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  

### (c) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of FiberTower of FiberTower Common Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no certificates or scrip for fractional First Avenue Common Shares
shall be issued in the Merger and no First Avenue Common Shares dividend,
stock split, subdivision or interest shall relate to any fractional security,
and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a stockholder of First Avenue. In lieu of any such
fractional share (after aggregating all fractional First Avenue Common Shares
to be received by such holder), each holder of FiberTower Common Shares who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a First Avenue
Common Share upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange shall be entitled
to receive from the Exchange Agent a cash payment equal to such fraction
multiplied by the closing price of the First Avenue Common Shares on the
Nasdaq National Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") for the last trading day immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No interest shall be payable with respect to any
amounts to be paid under this Section 2.2(d).

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Period; Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. At
any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, First Avenue
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
remaining portion of the First Avenue Common Shares deposited with the
Exchange Agent, and holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look only to
First Avenue (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws)
with respect to the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto issuable or payable pursuant to Section
2.1, Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(d) upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of First Avenue, Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate with regard to First
Avenue Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

  

### (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, and if First Avenue reasonably believes that the Person
providing the indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy, the making of a
reasonable undertaking to indemnify First Avenue or FiberTower, or, if First
Avenue does not so reasonably believe, the posting by such Person of a bond
in the form customarily required by First Avenue to indemnify against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will distribute such Merger Consideration, dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof issuable or payable in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2(b)
and Section 2.2(d), in each case, without interest. Any delivery or surrender
for exchange of a Certificate pursuant to this Section 2.2 may be effected

     

   

### 

  

### (in lieu of such delivery or exchange for surrender of a Certificate) by
delivery of an affidavit together with an indemnity undertaking or
indemnity bond in accordance with this Section 2.2(f).

  

### (g) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Rule 145 Affiliate (as
determined pursuant to Section 5.9) of FiberTower shall not be exchanged
until First Avenue has received a written agreement from such Person as
provided in Section 5.9.

  

### (h) _Withholding_. First Avenue or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of FiberTower Common Shares such amounts as
First Avenue or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the Treasury
Regulations or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by First Avenue or the Exchange Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the FiberTower Common Shares in respect of
when such deduction and withholding was made by First Avenue or the Exchange
Agent.

  

SECTION 2.3 _APPRAISAL RIGHTS_. FiberTower Common Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
neither shall have voted in favor of the Merger nor shall have consented
thereto in writing and who shall have demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with the DGCL are referred to herein as " _Dissenting FiberTower
Shares_ ". Dissenting FiberTower Shares shall not be converted into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to
appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. FiberTower
shall give First Avenue prompt notice of any demands received by FiberTower
for appraisal of FiberTower Common Shares. Except as required by applicable
law or with the prior written consent of First Avenue, FiberTower shall not
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands.

  

SECTION 2.4 _ADJUSTMENTS_. In the event that prior to the Effective
Time, there shall have been declared or effected a stock split, subdivision,
reverse stock split, consolidation and division, stock dividend or stock
distribution (including any dividend, or distribution, of securities
convertible into FiberTower Common Shares or First Avenue Common Shares),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or similar event made with
respect to FiberTower Common Shares or the First Avenue Common Shares, the
Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of
such event. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Exchange Ratio
set forth in Section 2.1(a) above is based on the assumption that First
Avenue and FiberTower will issue the number of options expected to be issued,
as set forth on Schedule 5.1(b)(vi) of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter and
Schedule 5.1(b)(vi) of the FiberTower Disclosure Letter, respectively, that
no warrants to acquire First Avenue Common Shares will be exercised pursuant
to a cashless exercise during the period from the execution and delivery of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, and that no unvested First Avenue
Common Shares or FiberTower Shares, or options or warrants to purchase First
Avenue Common Shares or FiberTower Common Shares, are forfeited, cancelled or
repurchased. In the event that the

     

   



  

number of options actually issued is different than the number expected to be
issued, any such warrants are exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise prior
to the Effective Time, or any such unvested options or shares are forfeited,
cancelled or repurchased, the Exchange Ratio shall be recalculated so that
stockholders who hold FiberTower Common Shares and options or warrants to
purchase FiberTower Common Shares immediately prior to the Merger
will receive in the Merger a number of First Avenue Common Shares
representing 51%, on a fully-diluted basis, of the total number of First
Avenue Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately after the Merger. In
such event, each of First Avenue and FiberTower shall deliver to the other,
no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, a certificate
executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
such party setting forth, and showing in reasonable detail the calculation
of, the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted, together with an itemized and detailed
list showing the number of shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis as of
the date of this Agreement and each issuance of First Avenue Common Shares or
FiberTower Common Shares issued subsequent to such date, including any option
or warrant grants, option or warrant exercises, and any cancellations,
repurchases or forfeitures. Any such certificates delivered pursuant to this
Section 2.4 shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding on
all parties hereto.

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
 OF ****FIRST AVENUE AND MERGER SUB**

  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered to FiberTower
concurrently with the execution hereof (the " _First Avenue Disclosure
Letter_ ") or except for events or facts disclosed with
reasonable specificity in the First Avenue Reports (as defined in Section
4.7) filed since January 1, 2006, First Avenue and Merger Sub, jointly and
severally, represent and warrant to FiberTower that:

  

SECTION 4.1 _EXISTENCE; GOOD STANDING; CORPORATE AUTHORITY_. Each of
First Avenue and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each
of First Avenue and Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so qualified has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a First Avenue Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 8.9). Each of First Avenue and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of each
of First Avenues and Merger Subs charter documents previously made
available to FiberTower are true and correct and contain all amendments as of
the date hereof.

  

SECTION 4.2 _AUTHORIZATION, VALIDITY AND EFFECT OF AGREEMENTS_. Each of
First Avenue and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and
documents contemplated hereby to which it is a party. The consummation by
each of First Avenue and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the issuance and delivery by First Avenue of the First Avenue
Common Shares pursuant to the Merger, has been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action other than, with respect to the issuance of First
Avenue Common Shares pursuant to the Merger, the approval of First Avenues
stockholders. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of each of First Avenue and Merger Sub, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to or limiting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity.

  

SECTION 4.3 _CAPITALIZATION_. The authorized capital of First Avenue
consists of 100,000,000 First Avenue Common Shares. As of May 12, 2006, there
were (a) 65,249,850 First Avenue Common Shares issued and outstanding, and
(b) 3,705,669 First Avenue Common Shares subject to outstanding options
issued under the stock options plans of First Avenue listed

  

## 

     

   



  

on Schedule 4.3 of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter (the " _First Avenue
Option Plans_ "). All issued and outstanding First Avenue Common Shares (i)
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, (ii) were not issued in violation of the terms of any
agreement or other understanding binding upon First Avenue and (iii) were
issued in compliance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
First Avenue and all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. The
First Avenue Common Shares to be issued in connection with the Merger, when
issued in accordance with this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except (x) as set forth in
this Section 4.3 or on Schedule 4.3 of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter,
(y) for any First Avenue Common Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of
options referred to in subsection (b) above and (z) for options issued under
the First Avenue Option Plans after the date of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 5.1(b)(vi) and First Avenue Common Shares issued pursuant to the
exercise of such options, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock of
First Avenue and there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
stockholder rights plan or similar instruments, convertible securities, or
other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate First Avenue or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of First Avenue or any of its Subsidiaries. First
Avenue has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the
holders of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
First Avenue on any matter.

  

SECTION 4.4 _SUBSIDIARIES_. Each of First Avenues Subsidiaries is
a corporation, limited liability company or partnership duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate,
limited liability company or partnership power and authority to own, operate
and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or
lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so
qualified or to be in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a First Avenue Material Adverse Effect. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each
of First Avenues Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly (as specified on
Schedule 4.4 of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter), by First Avenue free and
clear of all Liens, except to the extent of any third-party minority
ownership or Liens set forth on Schedule 4.4 of the First Avenue Disclosure
Letter. Schedule 4.4 of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter sets forth, for
each Subsidiary of First Avenue, its name and jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.4 of the First Avenue
Disclosure Letter, no options, warrants or other rights to purchase,
agreements or other obligations to issue or other rights (whether by law,
pre-emptive or contractual) to convert any obligations into or otherwise
acquire shares of capital stock or ownership interests in any of
the Subsidiaries of First Avenue are outstanding or will come into existence
as a result of the execution of this Agreement or consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Merger Sub are owned directly by First Avenue. Merger Sub was formed

and has not engaged in any activities other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any note,

Material Adverse Effect.

Schedule 4.6(c) of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter, no consents,
assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates are necessary in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to provide for the
continuation in full force and effect of all of the First Avenue Permits and
First Avenues contracts or leases or for First Avenue to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, except where the failure to receive such
consents or other certificates has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a First Avenue Material Adverse Effect.

Letter, either the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will: (i) result in any

or independent contractor of First Avenue under any First Avenue Plan (as
defined in Section 4.11) or otherwise; (ii) increase any benefits

Securities and Exchange Commission (" _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2003, each in
the form (including exhibits and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC
prior to the date hereof (collectively, the " _First Avenue Reports_ "), and
First Avenue has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed

required to be contributed to) by First Avenue, any First Avenue Subsidiary
or any entity which is considered one employer with First Avenue under
Section 4001 of ERISA.

  

### (j) Neither First Avenue nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or

Plan.

the financial statements included in the First Avenue Reports.

  

### (q) Each First Avenue Plan may be amended or terminated without liability
(other than with respect to the payment of benefits in the ordinary course)
to First Avenue or any of its Subsidiaries at any time and without
contravening the terms of such plan, or any law or agreement. Except as set
forth in this Agreement, following the Effective Time, First Avenue or any of
its Subsidiaries (or any successors thereto) may amend or terminate or cause
to be amended or terminated any First Avenue Plan without liability (other
than with respect to the payment of benefits in the ordinary course) to First
Avenue or any of its Subsidiaries (or successors thereto).

  

### (r) No First Avenue Plan provides for the payment of any amounts or any
other change of control transaction or subsequent event, that could
reasonably be expected to be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning

or obligation which pertains to the acquisition or disposition of any asset,
other than sales of products and services by First Avenue to its customers in
the ordinary course of business, or which provides any third party any Lien,
claim or preferential right with regard thereto, except, in the case of this

or the revocation, cancellation, suspension, nonrenewal, placement of
restrictions on, or material adverse modification of any of the First Avenue
Authorizations.

  

### (d) No event has occurred which results in, or after notice or lapse of
time, or both, could reasonably be expected to result in a First Avenue

regulation, rule or order of the FCC or any state regulatory authority,

other obligations, would not result in a First Avenue Material Adverse
Effect. First Avenue has all First Avenue Authorizations from, has made all
required filings with, and has made all required payments due to, all
Governmental Authorities, including any state regulatory authority and the
FCC, required to conduct its businesses as the same are now being conducted,

Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, it (i) will not (and
FiberTower will not permit its officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives, including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by FiberTower, to) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing non-public information) any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including any proposal or offer to its stockholders) with respect to a third
party tender offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of
assets, sale of stock or joint venture or similar transaction involving any
assets or class of capital stock of FiberTower, or any

     

   



  

acquisition of the capital stock of FiberTower or a business or assets (other
than sales of current assets in the ordinary course of business) of
FiberTower in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, or
any combination of the foregoing (any such proposal, offer or transaction
being hereinafter referred to as a " _FiberTower Acquisition Proposal_ ") or
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning a
FiberTower Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) will immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any FiberTower Acquisition Proposal;
provided that, subject to Section 7.3(c), nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent FiberTower or its Board of Directors from (A) making any
disclosure to the holders of FiberTower Common Shares if FiberTowers Board
of Directors determines in good faith that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties under applicable law or (B) providing information (pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form and which does not

Acquisition Proposal with respect to all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of FiberTower or all or substantially all of the assets of FiberTower
if, with respect to the actions set forth in clause (B), (x)
FiberTowers Board of Directors determines in good faith that taking into
account, among other things, the likelihood of consummation and after
consultation with its financial advisors, such FiberTower Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more favorable to
the holders of FiberTower Shares from a financial point of view than the
Merger (a " _FiberTower Superior Proposal_ ") and (y) the Board of Directors
of FiberTower, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines
in good faith that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

directors, employees, agents or representatives. In connection with such
notice, FiberTower shall indicate the identity of the person or group making
such request or inquiry or engaging in such negotiations or discussions and
the material terms and conditions of any FiberTower Acquisition Proposal.
Thereafter, FiberTower shall keep First Avenue fully informed on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material changes, additions
or adjustments to the terms of any such proposal or offer. Prior to taking
any action referred to in clause (B) of the proviso of Section 5.2(a)(i), if
FiberTower intends to participate in any such discussions or negotiations or
provide any such information to any such third party, FiberTower shall give
prior written notice to First Avenue.

  

#### (iii) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall permit FiberTower to enter into

Agreement shall prevent First Avenue or its Board of Directors from (A)
complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a
First Avenue Acquisition Proposal, (B) making any disclosure to the holders
of First Avenue Common Shares if First Avenues Board of Directors determines
in good faith that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law or
Nasdaq rules or (C) providing information (pursuant to a confidentiality
agreement in reasonably customary form and which does not contain terms that
prevent First Avenue from complying with its obligations under this Section
5.2) to or engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person or
group who has made an unsolicited bona fide First Avenue Acquisition Proposal

Avenue or all or substantially all of the assets of First Avenue if, with
respect to the actions set forth in clause (C), (x) First Avenues Board of
Directors determines in good faith that taking into account, among other
things, the likelihood of consummation and after consultation with its

_First Avenue Superior Proposal_ ") and (y) the Board of Directors of First
Avenue, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in good
faith that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable law.

directors, employees, agents or representatives. In connection with such
notice, First Avenue shall indicate the identity of the person or group
making such request or inquiry or engaging in such negotiations or
discussions and the material terms and conditions of any First
Avenue Acquisition Proposal. Thereafter, First Avenue shall keep FiberTower
fully informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of any
material changes, additions or adjustments to the terms of any such proposal
or offer. Prior to taking any action referred to in clause (C) of the proviso
of Section 5.2(b)(i), if First Avenue intends to participate in any such

     

   

#### 

  

#### discussions or negotiations or provide any such information to any
such third party, First Avenue shall give prior written notice to FiberTower.

Securities Law. Each of FiberTower and First Avenue shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Permit Application, the Hearing Notice and the

with the others counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Permit
Application, the Hearing Notice and the FiberTower Information Statement. The
FiberTower Information Statement shall constitute a disclosure document for
the offer and issuance of the First Avenue Common Shares. Whenever any event

anything contained herein to the contrary, FiberTower shall not include in
the FiberTower Information Statement any information with respect to First
Avenue or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which
information shall not have been approved by First Avenue prior to such
inclusion; provided, however, that First Avenue shall not unreasonably
withhold approval of any

     

   

information required to be included by federal or state law or the California
Commissioner. FiberTower shall promptly advise First Avenue, and First Avenue
shall promptly advise FiberTower, in writing if at any time prior to the
Effective Time either FiberTower or First Avenue shall obtain knowledge of
any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement
the Hearing Notice, the Permit Application, and/or the FiberTower Information
Statement, in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law. FiberTower
and First Avenue shall cooperate in delivering any such amendment or
supplement to all the holders of FiberTower Shares and/or filing any such
amendment or supplement with the California Commissioner or its staff and/or
any other government officials.

  

### (d) First Avenue, with the full cooperation of FiberTower, shall as
promptly as practicable prepare, and subject to First Avenues receiving the
required information from FiberTower, First Avenue shall file with the SEC
under cover of Schedule 14C under the Exchange Act, the information statement
with respect to the action by written consent of stockholders of First Avenue
in connection with the Merger (such information statement in its definitive
form, the " _First Avenue Information Statement_ "). First Avenue shall use
its reasonable best efforts, and FiberTower shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with First Avenue, including by furnishing all
information concerning FiberTower and the holders of the capital stock of
FiberTower as may be requested by First Avenue, to have the First Avenue
Information Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after
such filing. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, First
Avenue shall not include in the First Avenue Information Statement any
information with respect to FiberTower or its affiliates or associates, the
form and content of which information shall not have been approved by
FiberTower prior to such inclusion; provided, however, that FiberTower shall
not unreasonably withhold approval of any information required to be included
therein by law. First Avenue shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and FiberTower shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with First
Avenue, prior to the Effective Time, all necessary state securities law or
"Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all expenses incident thereto.
First Avenue will advise FiberTower, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the First Avenue Information Statement has
been cleared by the SEC or any supplement or amendment has been filed, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the First Avenue Information
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC
for additional information, and shall supply FiberTower with copies of all
correspondence between First Avenue, or its representatives, and the SEC or
its staff with respect thereto.

  

### (e) First Avenue will cause the First Avenue Information Statement, at
the time it is mailed to stockholders of First Avenue, to comply as to form
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, _provided_
that FiberTower shall be responsible for furnishing to First Avenue all
information relating to FiberTower and holders of FiberTower capital stock as
is required to be included therein. FiberTower will cause the information it
provides for such purpose to comply as to form in all material respects with
such provisions.

  

### (f) FiberTower hereby covenants and agrees with First Avenue that the
First Avenue Information Statement, at the time it is first mailed to
stockholders of First Avenue, will not

     

   

contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading ( _provided_ , _however_ , that this paragraph shall
apply only to information included or incorporated by reference in the First
Avenue Information Statement that was supplied in writing by FiberTower
expressly for inclusion therein). If, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any event with respect to FiberTower, or with respect to other
information supplied by FiberTower for inclusion in the First Avenue
Information Statement, occurs and such event is required to be described in a
supplement to the First Avenue Information Statement, FiberTower shall
promptly notify First Avenue of such occurrence and shall cooperate with
First Avenue in the preparation, filing and dissemination of such supplement.

  

### (g) First Avenue hereby covenants and agrees with FiberTower that the
First Avenue Information Statement, at the time it is first mailed to
stockholders of First Avenue, will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this paragraph shall not apply to any information included
or incorporated by reference in the First Avenue Information Statement that
was supplied in writing by FiberTower expressly for inclusion therein). If,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to First
Avenue, or with respect to other information included in the First Avenue
Information Statement, occurs and such event is required to be described in a
supplement to the First Avenue Information Statement, First Avenue shall
promptly notify FiberTower of such occurrence, such event shall be so
described and such supplement shall be promptly prepared, filed and
disseminated.

  

### (h) Neither the First Avenue Information Statement nor any amendment or
supplement thereto will be filed or disseminated to the stockholders of First
Avenue without the approval of both First Avenue and FiberTower. Each of
First Avenue and FiberTower will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
First Avenue Information Statement to be mailed to stockholders of First
Avenue as promptly as practicable after the date it is cleared by the SEC.

  

### (i) If FiberTower and First Avenue reasonably determine that it would be
impossible or impracticable to obtain the Permit or the issuance of the
Permit has been denied by the California Commissioner, then FiberTower and
First Avenue shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to
register the First Avenue Common Shares to be issued in the Merger on a
registration statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

  

SECTION 5.8 _LISTING APPLICATION_. First Avenue shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain Nasdaq approval of the continued listing of
the First Avenue Common Shares on Nasdaq following the Merger pursuant to
Nasdaqs rules regarding "reverse mergers" and to cause the First Avenue
Common Shares to be issued in the Merger to be approved for quotation on
Nasdaq prior to the Effective Time, all subject to official notice of
issuance. First Avenue shall promptly prepare and submit to Nasdaq a listing
application covering the continued listing of First Avenue Common Shares on
Nasdaq and covering the shares of First Avenue Common Shares issuable in the
Merger and shares issuable pursuant to Assumed Options (as defined in Section
5.13(c)).

     

   

SECTION 5.9 _AGREEMENTS OF AFFILIATES_. Prior to the Effective
Time, FiberTower shall cause to be prepared and delivered to First Avenue a
list identifying all persons who, as of the date of this Agreement,
FiberTower believes may be deemed to be "affiliates" of FiberTower, as that
term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act (the " _Rule 145 Affiliates_"). First Avenue shall be entitled to place
restrictive legends on any shares of First Avenue Common Shares issued
to such Rule 145 Affiliates. FiberTower shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in
such list to deliver to First Avenue, at or prior to the Effective Time, a
written agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_.

  

SECTION 5.10 _REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT_. As an inducement to the Rule
145 Affiliates to enter into the agreements described in Section 5.9
above, First Avenue shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, enter into
a Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
G_ with the Rule 145 Affiliates.

  

SECTION 5.11 _EXPENSES_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses, except as expressly provided in Section 7.5 and except that each of
FiberTower and First Avenue shall pay one-half of any filing fee required to
be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any fees relating to the filings described in Sections 5.4, 5.7 and
5.8 hereof.

  

SECTION 5.12 _INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE_.

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, First Avenue shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law each person who is immediately
prior to the Effective Time, or has been at any time prior to the Effective
Time, an officer or director of FiberTower or First Avenue (or any division
thereof) and each person who immediately prior to the Effective Time is
serving or prior to the Effective Time has served at the request of
FiberTower or First Avenue as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in
their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or
after the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ "), (i) First Avenue shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay, as incurred, the fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to First Avenue, in advance of the final disposition of
any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and, if
required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law, and
(ii) First Avenue will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, neither First
Avenue nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further that neither First
Avenue nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this
Section 5.12(a) to pay the fees and disbursements

     

   

of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action,
unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there
is or may be a conflict of interests between two or more of such Indemnified
Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly
situated group. In no event shall First Avenue or the Surviving Corporation
be required to indemnify any of the Indemnified Parties or advance any
expenses on behalf of any of the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section
5.12 to any greater extent than FiberTower or First Avenue, as applicable,
would have been required to so indemnify or advance expenses pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of FiberTower or First Avenue, as
applicable, or contractual indemnification agreements binding on FiberTower
or First Avenue, as applicable (as disclosed on Schedule 5.12(a) of the
FiberTower Disclosure Letter or the First Avenue Disclosure Letter,
as applicable), each as in existence on the date hereof.

  

### (b) The parties agree that the rights to indemnification hereunder,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of
any action or suit, in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and any
indemnification agreement of FiberTower or First Avenue with respect to
matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Action pending or asserted or claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action
or resolution of such claim.

  

### (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain officers and directors liability insurance (" _D
andO Insurance_") covering the Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior
to the Effective Time were covered by FiberTowers existing DandO Insurance
policies providing for coverage of at least $5.0 million and otherwise on
terms substantially no less advantageous to such Indemnified Parties than
such existing DandO Insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged
acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or
other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before
or after the Effective Time); provided that, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 150% of the 2005 annual premium paid by FiberTower prior to the date
hereof (the amount of which premiums are set forth in Schedule 5.12(c) of the
FiberTower Disclosure Letter) (the " _FiberTower Maximum Premium_ "), but in
such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount. First Avenue shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended
under FiberTowers DandO Insurance policy by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy
on terms and conditions no less advantageous than FiberTowers existing DandO
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
Section 5.12(c) with respect to Indemnified Parties who are or at any time
prior to the Effective Time were covered by FiberTowers existing DandO
Insurance. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, First Avenue
shall maintain DandO Insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who are or at
any time prior to the Effective Time were covered by First Avenues existing
DandO Insurance policies providing for coverage of at least $5.0 million and
otherwise on terms substantially no less advantageous to such Indemnified
Parties than such existing DandO Insurance with respect to acts or omissions,
or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims,
actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or
claimed before or after the Effective Time); provided that, after the
Effective Time, First Avenue shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 150% of the 2005 annual premium paid by First Avenue prior to the
date

     

   

hereof (the amount of which premiums are set forth in Schedule 5.12(c) of the
First Avenue Disclosure Letter) (the " _First Avenue Maximum Premium_ "), but
in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount. First Avenue shall have the right to cause coverage to be
extended under First Avenues DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail"
policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous than First Avenues
existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions
of this Section 5.12(c) with respect to Indemnified Persons who are or at any
time prior to the Effective Time were covered by First Avenues existing DandO
Insurance.

  

### (d) The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and are expressly intended to benefit
each of the Indemnified Parties. In the event First Avenue or any of its
successors or assigns (i) is consolidated with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such
consolidation or merger and the obligations of First Avenue under this
Section 5.12 do not become the obligations of the successor under operation
of law or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any
Person, then and in either such case, First Avenue shall cause proper
provision be made so that the successors and assigns of First Avenue shall
expressly assume in writing the obligations of First Avenue set forth in this
Section 5.12 that still survive.

  

SECTION 5.13 _EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_.

  

(a) First Avenue hereby agrees to honor, and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries
to honor, all employee benefit plans, contracts, agreements and commitments
of FiberTower maintained or entered into by FiberTower prior to the date
hereof that apply to any current or former employee or current or former
director of FiberTower, including the employment agreements between
FiberTower and certain of its key employees (copies of which employment
agreements have been furnished to First Avenue); provided, however, that,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.13, First Avenue
reserves the right to modify any such plan, contract, agreement or commitment
in accordance with its terms.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.13(a):

  

#### (i) To the extent permitted under existing First Avenue benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements, each employee of FiberTower (and any
successor entities to FiberTower) shall become a participant in any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement of First Avenue applicable to
similarly situated employees on or after the Effective Time and shall be
given credit under such plan, program, policy, or arrangement for all service
with FiberTower and any of its predecessors to the extent such
predecessor employment was recognized by FiberTower, and, if applicable, with
First Avenue, prior to becoming such a participant for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit determination; provided that this Section
5.13(a)(i) shall not result in the duplication of any benefit or apply to the
determination of accrual service under any defined benefit pension plan as
defined in section 3(35) of ERISA (regardless of whether such plan is
qualified under Code section 401(a)), and shall not apply to the
determination of the right to receive, or the amount of, any retiree or other
post-retirement medical service (except for COBRA medical continuation
coverage as described in section 4980B of the Code).

     

   

#### (ii) To the extent permitted under existing First Avenue benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements, First Avenue shall cause each employee
of FiberTower (and any successor entities to FiberTower) who was covered by a
group health plan of FiberTower immediately prior to the Effective Time to be
covered under a group health plan maintained by First Avenue as of the
Effective Time and without any gap or lapse of coverage and First Avenue
shall cause (A) such employee and his or her eligible dependents (including,
without limitation, all such dependents of the employee covered immediately
prior to such time under FiberTowers group health plan) to be credited under
such First Avenue group health plan, for the year during which such coverage
under such group health plan begins, with any deductibles and copayments
already incurred during such year under the group health plan of FiberTower
(or successor entity to FiberTower), and (B) such First Avenue group health
plan to waive any preexisting condition restrictions to the extent necessary
to provide immediate coverage to the extent such preexisting condition
restrictions have been waived, or would have been waived, under FiberTowers
group health plan or as otherwise required by applicable law.

  

#### (iii) Nothing in this Section 5.13 shall be construed to restrict the
ability of First Avenue (including, without limitation, FiberTower and any
successor entity to FiberTower for so long as it is a Subsidiary of First
Avenue) to modify or terminate any plan at or after the Effective Time.

  

#### (iv) Nothing in this Section 5.13 shall be construed as a contract of
employment, and this Section 5.13 shall not give any employee the right to be
retained in the employ of First Avenue or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this Section 5.13 shall be construed to require the provision of coverage or
benefits to an employee except to the extent such coverage or benefits is
otherwise required pursuant to applicable law, the terms of the applicable
plan or arrangement or any employment agreement or employment offer letter.

  

#### (v) Nothing herein shall be construed to cause the employees of
FiberTower to be third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions of
this Section 5.13 or have any rights to enforce such provisions against the
parties.

  

### (c) First Avenue and FiberTower shall take all such actions, including
(with respect to FiberTower) the amendment of outstanding options (whether
vested or unvested) (" _Stock Options_ ") to purchase FiberTower Common
Shares to the extent reasonably necessary, and the plans pursuant to which
such options have been issued, to permit First Avenue to assume, and First
Avenue shall assume, effective at the Effective Time, each FiberTower Option
Plan and each outstanding Stock Option that remains unexercised in whole or
in part as of the Effective Time and each such assumed option shall,
effective as of the Effective Time, thereafter be exercisable for First
Avenue Common Shares in accordance with the following (each such assumed
Stock Option, an " _Assumed Option_ "):

  

#### (i) the number of First Avenue Common Shares purchasable under the
Assumed Option shall be equal to 0.3045470 (to be adjusted appropriately if
the Exchange Ratio is adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4) times the number of
FiberTower Common Shares underlying the Assumed Option (or that would be
purchasable if the option was then vested and exercisable and with any
fractional amount rounded to the next lowest share);

     

   

#### (ii) the per share exercise price of such Assumed Option shall be an
amount (with fractional amounts rounded to the next highest cent) equal to
the per share exercise price of the Stock Option being assumed divided by
0.3045470 (to be adjusted appropriately if the Exchange Ratio is adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.4);

  

#### (iii) First Avenue will provide each holder of an Assumed Option with a
statement showing the converted number of shares, the exercise price, and the
expiration date for each Assumed Option; and

  

#### (iv) any other provisions of each Assumed Option shall remain in effect;
provided, however, that in the case of any option to which Section 421 of the
Code applies by reason of the qualifications under Section 422 or 423 of
the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  

### (d) First Avenue shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of First Avenue Common Shares for delivery upon
exercise of the Assumed Options, and, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, First Avenue shall file a registration statement on Form S-8
(or other appropriate form) with respect to the First Avenue Common Shares
subject to the Assumed Options, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any
of the Assumed Options remain outstanding.

  

### (e) First Avenue agrees that its Board of Directors (or the Compensation
Committee thereof) shall, at or prior to the Effective Time, adopt
resolutions specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act, the receipt, pursuant to this Agreement, of First Avenue
Common Shares and Assumed Options by persons who will be directors or
officers of First Avenue as of the Effective Time.

  

### (f) First Avenue agrees that it shall, prior to the Effective Time, amend
the First Avenue Networks, Inc. Stock Option Plan (the "First Avenue
Plan"), effective as of the Effective Time, to (i) increase the number of
shares issuable under the plan to at least 23,314,588 shares; (ii) include an
"evergreen provision" under which the number of shares issuable under such
plan would increase each year by either 1.5% of the number of First Avenue
Common Shares issued and outstanding at the time immediately prior to the
date of such increase or a lesser number of shares determined by the Board of
Directors through the remaining term of the plan; and (iii) provide for
automatic annual grants of options to purchase up to 25,000 shares in
accordance with the terms of the First Avenue Plan to each director of First
Avenue (" _Option Plan Amendment_ ").

  

SECTION 5.14 _TAX MATTERS_.

  

### (a) Each of FiberTower and First Avenue and its Subsidiaries shall duly
and timely file all Tax Returns that it or they are required to file and
shall pay all unpaid Taxes shown on such Tax Returns, subject to timely
extensions permitted by law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that each party shall
promptly notify the other party of any such extensions. From and after the
Closing, FiberTower and First Avenue shall file a federal consolidated Tax
Return and shall jointly

     

   

determine whether to file applicable combined, consolidated or unitary state
and local income Tax Returns as and to the extent permitted or required by
law.

  

### (b) FiberTower shall provide First Avenue with a certification in
accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(c)(3) that it is not a United States real property holding
corporation.

  

### (c) From and after the date hereof, neither FiberTower nor First Avenue
or any of its Subsidiaries will (i) take any action or fail to take any
action that they know or have reason to believe may cause the Merger to fail
to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) or (ii) enter
into any contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement the performance of
which they know or have reason to believe may have such effect. From and
after the date hereof, neither First Avenue nor any of its Subsidiaries will
(i) take any action or fail to take any action that they know or have reason
to believe may cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-
free reorganization under Section 368(a) or (ii) enter into any contract,
agreement, commitment or arrangement the performance of which they know or
have reason to believe may have such effect.

  

SECTION 5.15 _FIRST AVENUE GOVERNANCE MATTERS_.

  

### (a) First Avenue shall take all requisite action, effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to amend its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (i) to increase its authorized shares to four hundred million
(400,000,000) First Avenue Common Shares; (ii) provide for a classified board

will expire and, despite the expiration of his or her term, until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any such board designee becomes unable or unwilling to serve
as a director of First Avenue at the Effective Time, then the party

  



   

60   

 

  

### that designated such individual shall designate another individual

### Merger and recommended and declared advisable a FiberTower
Superior Proposal, or resolved to do the foregoing, after the Board shall

7.3(c) until it (i) shall have delivered to First Avenue written notice at

Avenue with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms

recognized outside legal counsel, which may be its current outside legal
counsel), in which case FiberTower shall no longer have the right to
terminate under this Section 7.3(c) with respect to such proposal; provided

satisfied and (ii) such breach is not curable, or, if curable, is not cured
within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given by First Avenue

Avenue shall no longer have the right to terminate under this Section 7.4(c)
with respect to such proposal; provided that, prior to such termination,
First Avenue shall have paid the fee and reimbursed the expenses as required
by Section 7.5 by wire transfer in same day funds to an account designated by

SECTION 7.5 _EFFECT OF TERMINATION_.

  

### (a) If this Agreement is terminated:

  

#### (i) by FiberTower pursuant to Section 7.3(c); or

  

#### (ii) by First Avenue pursuant to Section 7.4(b);

  

then FiberTower shall pay to First Avenue the Termination Amount (as defined
below) and, in addition, reimburse First Avenue for all expenses incurred by
First Avenue in connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement
Maximum Amount (as defined below) prior to or upon termination of this
Agreement. All payments under this Section 7.5(a) shall be made in cash by
wire transfer to an account designated by First Avenue at the time of such
termination. The term " _Termination Amount_ " shall mean $20,000,000. The
term " _Reimbursement Maximum Amount_ " shall mean $500,000. FiberTower
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.5(a) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, First Avenue would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if FiberTower fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.5(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, First
Avenue commences a suit which results in a judgment against FiberTower for
the payment set forth in this Section 7.5(a), FiberTower shall pay to First
Avenue its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the Termination Amount and other amounts
to be reimbursed to First Avenue under this Section 7.5(a) from the
date payment was required to be made until the date of such payment at the
prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus one percent (1%). If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to a provision that calls for a payment to be made under this
Section 7.5(a), it shall not be a defense to FiberTowers obligation to pay
hereunder that this Agreement could have been terminated under a different
provision or could have been terminated at an earlier or later time.

     

   

### (b) If this Agreement is terminated:

  

#### (i) by FiberTower pursuant to Section 7.3(b); or

  

#### (ii) by First Avenue pursuant to Section 7.4(c);

  

then First Avenue shall pay to FiberTower the Termination Amount and, in
addition, reimburse FiberTower for all expenses incurred by FiberTower in
connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount prior
to or upon termination of this Agreement. All payments under this Section
7.5(b) shall be made in cash by wire transfer to an account designated by
FiberTower at the time of such termination. First Avenue acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 7.5(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, FiberTower would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
First Avenue fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section
7.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, FiberTower commences a suit
which results in a judgment against First Avenue for the payment set forth in
this Section 7.5(b), First Avenue shall pay to FiberTower its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the Termination Amount and other amounts to be reimbursed to
FiberTower under this Section 7.5(b) from the date payment was required to be
made until the date of such payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus one percent
(1%). If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to a provision that calls for
a payment to be made under this Section 7.5(b), it shall not be a defense to
First Avenues obligation to pay hereunder that this Agreement could have
been terminated under a different provision or could have been terminated at
an earlier or later time.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
May 14, 2006 (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** "), by and among First Avenue
Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _First Avenue_** "), Marlin
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly-owned
subsidiary of First Avenue (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), and FiberTower
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" ** _FiberTower_** "), which provides
for, among other things, (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into
FiberTower, with FiberTower continuing as the surviving corporation (the " **
_Merger_** ") and (ii) the conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of FiberTower into the right to receive shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of First Avenue (the " ** _First Avenue Common
Shares_** ") and cash payment in lieu of fractional shares. Terms not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them
in the Merger Agreement.

  

The undersigned understands that the execution of this lock-up agreement
(this " ** _Lock-Up Agreement_** ") is a condition to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the " ** _Closing_**
"). The undersigned further understands that as a condition to the
willingness of First Avenue and FiberTower to enter into the Merger
Agreement, First Avenue and FiberTower have requested that the undersigned
agree to be bound and the undersigned hereby agrees to be bound, effective as
of the Effective Time, by the terms as follows:

  

1. Without prior written consent and waiver, the undersigned will not, during the period commencing on the date of the Closing (the " ** _Closing Date_** ") and ending on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the closing of a debt or equity financing with proceeds to First Avenue of at least $100,000,000 and the expiration of the duration of any lock-up requested by the underwriters, placement agents or investors in such financing (the " ** _Lock-Up Period_** "), for each three month period beginning on the Closing and on each of the three, six and nine month anniversaries of the Closing (each, a " ** _Quarterly Period_** ") (a) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any

     

   



  

option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell,
grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or
dispose of, directly or indirectly, an aggregate number of First Avenue
Common Shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable
or exchangeable for First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as
a result of the Merger that exceed the average weekly trading volume of
First Avenue Common Shares for the four calendar weeks preceding
the commencement of a Quarterly Period (the " ** _Sale_** **_Volume
Restriction_** "), or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences
of ownership of First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as a
result of the Merger that exceed the Sale Volume Restriction, whether any
such transaction described in clause (a) or (b) above is to be settled by
delivery of First Avenue Common Shares or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise.

  

2. The undersigned may transfer his/her/its First Avenue Common Shares during the Lock-Up Period (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, (ii) to an immediate family member of the undersigned or to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or an immediate family member of the undersigned, or (iii) to an Affiliate of the undersigned; provided, in each case, that any such transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement prior to such transfer. For purposes of this Lock-up Agreement, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin.

  

3. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 1 and 2, without prior written consent and waiver, the undersigned may not transfer any First Avenue Common Shares during the Lock-Up Period on any day when the trading price of First Avenue Common Shares is less than $6.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock split, subdivision, reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, or reclassification of First Avenue Common Shares).

  

4. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 1 and 2, the Sale Volume Restriction shall not apply:

  

(i) to private sales of First Avenue Common Shares not effected through The
Nasdaq National Market, any stock exchange or other securities market by the
undersigned; provided, that, the private purchaser agrees to be bound in
writing by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement prior to such private sale,
with such restriction to the volume of sales by such private purchaser being
equal to the Sale Volume Restriction multiplied by the percentage of the
total First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned immediately prior
to such sale that are sold by the undersigned to the private purchaser in
the private sale, and the restriction to the volume of sales by the
undersigned shall be reduced by such amount;

  

(ii) at any time during a trading day when the trading price of the First
Avenue Common Shares exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock
split, subdivision, reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock
distribution, recapitalization, or reclassification of First Avenue Common
Shares); provided,

     

   



  

however, that in the event the trading price per First Avenue Common Share
subsequently decreases below $12.00 per share (as so adjusted), all shares
sold above $12.00 per share (as so adjusted) in that Quarterly Period shall
be included in calculating the number of additional First Avenue Common
Shares, if any, that may be sold pursuant to Paragraph 1 in such Quarterly
Period; and

  

(iii) to 18.5% of the First Avenue Common Shares (calculated pursuant to
Section 5 below) held by the undersigned as of the Closing Date sold in
transactions made during the last 90 days prior to the first anniversary of
the Closing Date.

  

5. For purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement, First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as a result of the Merger shall consist of (i) all shares of First Avenue Common Shares issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger, if any, (ii) all shares of First Avenue Common Shares issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for First Avenue Common Shares held by or issued to the undersigned as a result of the Merger, if any, and (iii) all First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

6. The undersigned agrees and consents to the entry of stop-transfer instructions with First Avenues transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the undersigneds First Avenue Common Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

  

7. First Avenue and FiberTower hereby agree that no consent or waiver shall be granted with respect to the transfer of any securities that are subject to any lock-up in connection with the Merger unless the undersigned is: (i) provided with reasonable notice of such consent or waiver, and (ii) entitled to transfer a corresponding percentage of Restricted Shares (or any securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities) granted to the recipient of such waiver or consent.

  

8. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered under this Lock-Up Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by facsimile confirmation) to the address or facsimile number set forth beneath the name of such party below (or to such other address or facsimile number as such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other party):

The undersigned understands that the execution of this lock-up agreement

1. Without prior written consent and waiver, the undersigned will not, during the period commencing on the date of the Closing (the " ** _Closing Date_** ") and ending on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the closing of a debt or equity financing with proceeds to First Avenue of at least $100,000,000 and the expiration of the duration of any lock-up requested by the underwriters, placement agents or investors in such financing (the " ** _Lock-Up Period_** "), for each three month period beginning on the Closing and on each of the three, six and nine month anniversaries of the Closing (each, a " ** _Quarterly Period_** ") (a) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, an aggregate number of Restricted Shares (as such term is defined in Section 5

2. The undersigned may transfer his/her/its Restricted Shares during the Lock-Up Period (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, (ii) to an immediate family member of the undersigned or to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or an immediate family member of the undersigned, or (iii) to an Affiliate of the undersigned; provided, in each case, that any such transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement prior to such transfer.

(ii) at any time during a trading day when the trading price of the First

9.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

Reference is made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
May 14, 2006 (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** "), by and among First Avenue
Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _First Avenue_** "), Marlin
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly-owned
subsidiary of First Avenue (" ** _Merger Sub_** "), and FiberTower
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" ** _FiberTower_** "), which provides
for, among other things, (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into
FiberTower, with FiberTower continuing as the surviving corporation (the " **
_Merger_** ") and (ii) the conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of FiberTower into the right to receive shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of First Avenue (the " ** _First Avenue Common
Shares_** ") and cash payment in lieu of fractional shares. Terms not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them
in the Merger Agreement.

  

The undersigned understands that the execution of this lock-up agreement
(this " ** _Lock-Up Agreement_** ") is a condition to the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the " ** _Closing_**
"). The undersigned further understands that as a condition to the
willingness of First Avenue and FiberTower to enter into the Merger
Agreement, First Avenue and FiberTower have requested that the undersigned
agree to be bound and the undersigned hereby agrees to be bound, effective as
of the Effective Time, by the terms as follows:

  

1. Without prior written consent and waiver, the undersigned will not, during the period commencing on the date of the Closing (the " ** _Closing Date_** ") and ending on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the closing of a debt or equity financing with proceeds to First Avenue of at least $100,000,000 and the expiration of the duration of any lock-up requested by the underwriters, placement agents or investors in such financing (the " ** _Lock-Up Period_** "), for each three month period beginning on the Closing and on each of the three, six and nine month anniversaries of the Closing (each, a " ** _Quarterly Period_** ") (a) offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option,

     

   

right or warrant to purchase, lend or otherwise transfer or dispose of,
directly or indirectly, an aggregate number of First Avenue Common Shares or
any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for First
Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as a result of the Merger that
exceed [___] times _[to be determined based upon the respective fully diluted
share holdings in First Avenue as of the Closing Date of the holders listed
on Schedule 4.25 of the First Avenue Disclosure Letter dated as of the date
of the Merger Agreement, so that each such holder is allocated its pro rata
portion of 3 times the average weekly trading volume]_ the averag e weekly
trading volume of First Avenue Common Shares for the four calendar weeks
preceding the commencement of a Quarterly Period (the " ** _Sale_** **_Volume
Restriction_** "), or (b) enter into any swap or other arrangement that
transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences
of ownership of First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as a
result of the Merger that exceed the Sale Volume Restriction, whether any
such transaction described in clause (a) or (b) above is to be settled by
delivery of First Avenue Common Shares or such other securities, in cash or
otherwise.

  

2. The undersigned may transfer his/her/its First Avenue Common Shares during the Lock-Up Period (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts, (ii) to an immediate family member of the undersigned or to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or an immediate family member of the undersigned, or (iii) to an Affiliate of the undersigned; provided, in each case, that any such transferee agrees to be bound in writing by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement prior to such transfer. For purposes of this Lock-up Agreement, "immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption, not more remote than first cousin.

  

3. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 1 and 2, without prior written consent and waiver, the undersigned may not transfer any First Avenue Common Shares during the Lock-Up Period on any day when the trading price of First Avenue Common Shares is less than $6.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock split, subdivision, reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, or reclassification of First Avenue Common Shares).

  

4. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 1 and 2, the Sale Volume Restriction shall not apply:

  

(i) to private sales of First Avenue Common Shares not effected through The
Nasdaq National Market, any stock exchange or other securities market by the
undersigned; provided, that, the private purchaser agrees to be bound in
writing by the terms of this Lock-Up Agreement prior to such private sale,
with such restriction to the volume of sales by such private purchaser being
equal to the Sale Volume Restriction multiplied by the percentage of the
total First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned immediately prior to
such sale that are sold by the undersigned to the private purchaser in the
private sale, and the restriction to the volume of sales by the undersigned
shall be reduced by such amount;

     

   



  

(ii) at any time during a trading day when the trading price of the First
Avenue Common Shares exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for any stock
split, subdivision, reverse stock split, stock dividend or stock
distribution, recapitalization, or reclassification of First Avenue Common
Shares); provided, however, that in the event the trading price per
First Avenue Common Share subsequently decreases below $12.00 (as so
adjusted) per share, all shares sold above $12.00 per share (as so adjusted)
in that Quarterly Period shall be included in calculating the number of
additional First Avenue Common Shares, if any, that may be sold pursuant to
Paragraph 1 in such Quarterly Period; and

  

(iii) to 18.5% of the First Avenue Common Shares (calculated pursuant to
Section 5 below) held by the undersigned as of the Closing Date sold in
transactions made during the last 90 days prior to the first anniversary of
the Closing Date.

  

5. For purposes of this Lock-Up Agreement, First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as a result of the Merger shall consist of (i) all First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned and (ii) all shares of First Avenue Common Shares issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for First Avenue Common Shares held by or issued to the undersigned immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which the undersigned has dispositive control.

  

6. The undersigned agrees and consents to the entry of stop-transfer instructions with First Avenues transfer agent and registrar against the transfer of the undersigneds First Avenue Common Shares except in compliance with the foregoing restrictions.

  

7. First Avenue and FiberTower hereby agree that no consent or waiver shall be granted with respect to the transfer of any securities that are subject to any lock-up in connection with the Merger unless the undersigned is: (i) provided with reasonable notice of such consent or waiver, and (ii) entitled to transfer a corresponding percentage of First Avenue Common Shares held by the undersigned as a result of the Merger (or any securities issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities) granted to the recipient of such waiver or consent.

  

8. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered under this Lock-Up Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by facsimile confirmation) to the address or facsimile number set forth beneath the name of such party below (or to such other address or facsimile number as such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other party):

 **FORM OF FIBERTOWER AFFILIATES LETTER**

  

This AFFILIATE AGREEMENT, dated as of _________, 2006 (this " _Agreement_ ")
is among FIRST AVENUE NETWORKS, INC., a Delaware corporation (" _First
Avenue_ "), and the undersigned stockholder (" _Affiliate_ ") of FIBERTOWER
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _FiberTower_ "). Capitalized terms not
otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Merger Agreement.

  

 **RECITALS**

  

A. First Avenue, Marlin Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of First Avenue (" _Merger Sub_ "),
and FiberTower have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
May 14, 2006 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Merger Sub will
merge (the " _Merger_ ") with and into FiberTower, with FiberTower surviving
the Merger.

  

B. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, all issued and
outstanding FiberTower Common Shares will be converted into First Avenue
Common Shares;

  

C. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Affiliate is a material
inducement to First Avenue to enter into the Merger Agreement; and

  

D. Affiliate has been advised that Affiliate may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of FiberTower, as such term is used (i) for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Act_ ").

  

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, in the event that Affiliate is
deemed by First Avenue to be an "affiliate" of FiberTower, as such term is
used (i) for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Commission
under the Act, the parties agree as follows:

  

1. _Acknowledgments by Affiliate_. Affiliate acknowledges and understands that the representations, warranties and covenants made by Affiliate set forth in this Agreement will be relied upon by First Avenue, FiberTower, and their respective affiliates and counsel, and that substantial losses and damages may be incurred by such persons if Affiliates representations, warranties or covenants are breached. Affiliate has carefully read this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and has consulted with such legal counsel and financial advisers as Affiliate has deemed appropriate in connection with the execution of this Agreement.

  

2. _Compliance with Rule 145 and the Act_.

  

(a) Affiliate has been advised that (i) the issuance of shares of First
Avenue Common Shares in connection with the Merger is expected to be effected
in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10)
of the Securities Act, pursuant to a permit issued by the California
Corporations Commissioner under Section

     

   

25142 of the California Corporate Securities Laws of 1968, as amended, and
the resale of such shares will be subject to the restrictions set forth in
Rule 145 under the Act unless such shares are otherwise transferred pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Act or an appropriate
exemption from registration, and (ii) Affiliate may be deemed to be an
affiliate of FiberTower. Affiliate accordingly agrees not to sell, pledge,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares of First Avenue Common Shares
issued to Affiliate pursuant to the Merger Agreement, unless (i) such sale,
pledge, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with
the requirements of Rule 145 under the Act, as evidenced by a brokers
letter and a representation letter executed by Affiliate (which shall be in
form and content reasonably satisfactory to First Avenue) stating that such
requirements have been met, (ii) such sale, pledge, transfer or other
disposition is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Act, (iii) Affiliate delivers to First Avenue a written opinion of counsel,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to First Avenue to the effect
that such sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Act, or (iv) the staff of the Commission shall
have rendered written advice to Affiliate to the effect that the Commission
would take no action, or that the staff of the Commission would not recommend
that the Commission take action, with respect to such sale, transfer or other
disposition.

  

(b) First Avenue will give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent
with respect to any First Avenue Common Shares received by Affiliate pursuant
to the Merger Agreement and there will be placed on the certificates
representing such First Avenue Common Shares, or any substitutions therefor,
legends stating in substance:

  

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A
TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, APPLIES, AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN CONFORMITY WITH RULE 145,
PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN
OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER, IN FORM AND
SUBSTANCE TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR IN A MANNER IN CONFORMITY WITH,
AND AFTER RECEIPT OF, A NO ACTION LETTER FROM THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION."

  

The legend set forth above shall be removed (by delivery of a substitute
certificate without such legend), and First Avenue shall so instruct its
transfer agent, if a registration statement respecting the sale of the shares
has been declared effective under the Act or if Affiliate delivers to First
Avenue (i) satisfactory written evidence that the shares have been sold in
compliance with Rule 145 (in which case, the substitute certificate will be
issued in the name of the transferee), (ii) an opinion of counsel, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to First Avenue to the effect that sale
of the shares by the holder thereof is no longer subject to Rule 145, or
(iii) a copy of a "No Action" Letter to Affiliate from the staff of the
Commission and all other related communications with the Commission.

     

   

3. _Filing of SEC Reports_. From and after the Effective Time and as long as is necessary in order to permit Affiliate to sell First Avenue Common Shares held by Stockholder pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under the Act, First Avenue will use commercially reasonable efforts to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, as the same shall be in effect at the time, and shall otherwise make available adequate public information regarding First Avenue in such manner as may be required to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of Rule 144 under the Act.

  

4. _Miscellaneous_.

  

(a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same document. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement
by facsimile shall be effective to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law.

  

(b) This Agreement shall be enforceable by, and shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
As used in this Agreement, the term "successors and assigns" means, where the
context permits, heirs, executors, administrators, trustees and successor
trustees, and personal and other representatives.

  

(c) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENT
TO SUBMIT TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE AND OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN EITHER CASE LOCATED IN
WILMINGTON, DELAWARE (THE " _DELAWARE COURTS_ ") FOR ANY LITIGATION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT (AND AGREE NOT TO COMMENCE ANY LITIGATION RELATING THERETO
EXCEPT IN SUCH DELAWARE COURTS), WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION IN THE DELAWARE COURTS AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM
IN ANY DELAWARE COURT THAT SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT THEREIN HAS BEEN BROUGHT
IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

  

(d) If any term, provision, covenant, or restriction contained in this
Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remainder
of the terms, provisions, covenants, and restrictions contained in this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be
affected, impaired, or invalidated.

  

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge that First Avenue will be irreparably
harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of
any of the covenants or agreements of the undersigned set forth herein.
Therefore, it is agreed that,

     

   

in addition to any other remedies that may be available to First Avenue upon
any such violation of this Agreement, First Avenue shall have the right to
enforce such covenants and agreements by specific performance, injunctive
relief or by any other means available to First Avenue at law or in equity,
and Affiliate hereby waives any and all defenses that could exist in his or
her favor in connection with such enforcement and waives any requirement for
the security or posting of any bond in connection with such enforcement.

  

(f) In the event that any action, suit or other proceeding is instituted
concerning or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereunder for a violation of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall
recover all of such partys costs and attorneys fees incurred in each such
action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions
therefrom.

  

(g) Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly
delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by registered mail, by
courier or express delivery service or by facsimile confirmation) to the

 **FORM OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT**

  

This Registration Rights Agreement (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made and
entered into as of May __, 2006 by and between First Avenue Networks, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" ** _First Avenue_** "), and the individuals and
entities listed on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto who execute one or more
counterpart signature pages to this Agreement (the " ** _Holders_** ").

  

RECITALS

  

A. This Agreement is entered into pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of May [___],2006 (the " ** _Merger Agreement_** "), by
and among First Avenue, Marlin Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of First Avenue (" **
_Merger Sub_** "), and FiberTower Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" **
_FiberTower_** ").

  

B. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into FiberTower in
a statutory merger, with FiberTower as the surviving corporation in the
merger (the " ** _Merger_** ") in which all issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of FiberTower will be converted into the right to receive, and
will be exchangeable for, shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share,
of First Avenue (the " ** _First Avenue Common Shares_** ").

  

C. As an inducement for the Holders to approve the Merger Agreement, the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to enter
into the FiberTower Affiliates Letter, First Avenue desires to grant
registration rights to the Holders as contained herein.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual
promises hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

AGREEMENT

  

 **1. _Definitions and References_.**

  

Unless otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms in this Agreement
shall have the same meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, in addition to the definitions set forth
elsewhere herein, the following terms shall have the following
respective meanings:

  

" ** _Affiliate_** " of a Holder shall mean a person who, directly or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or
is under common control with such Holder, or the spouse or children (or a
trust exclusively for the benefit of a spouse and/or children) of such
Holder.

  

" ** _Material Disclosure Event_** " means, as of any date of determination,
any pending or imminent event relating to First Avenue, which, in the
determination of the Board of Directors of First Avenue (i) upon the advice
of counsel, requires disclosure of material, non-public

     

   

information relating to such event in any registration statement so that such
registration statement would not be materially misleading, (ii) upon the
advice of counsel, is otherwise not required to be publicly disclosed at that
time (e.g., on Forms 10-K, 8-K, or 10-Q) under applicable federal or state
securities laws, and (iii) if publicly disclosed at the time of such event,
would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
prospects of First Avenue or would materially adversely affect a pending or
proposed acquisition, merger, recapitalization, consolidation,
reorganization, financing or similar transaction, or negotiations with
respect thereto.

  

" ** _Register_** ," " ** _registered_** " and " ** _registration_**
" shall refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing the
registration statementin compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " ** _1933 Act_** "), and the declaration or ordering of
effectiveness of the registration statementby the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " ** _SEC_** ").

  

" ** _Registrable Stock_** " shall mean (a) the First Avenue Common Shares
issued to a Holder pursuant to the Merger Agreement; and (b) any First
Avenue Common Shares issued as (or issuable upon the conversion or exercise
of any warrant, right, option or other convertible security which is issued
as) a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for, or
in replacement of, such shares. For purposes of this Agreement, any
Registrable Stock shall cease to be Registrable Stock when (w) the
registration statement covering such Registrable Stock has been declared
effective and such Registrable Stock has been disposed of pursuant to such
effective registration statement, (x) such Registrable Stock is sold by a
Holder in a transaction that is exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 144
under the 1933 Act or a transaction in which the Holders rights under this
Agreement are not assigned, (y) such Registrable Stock may be sold under Rule
144(k) under the 1933 Act, or (z) such Registrable Stock has ceased to be
outstanding. In addition, the Registrable Stock held by any Holder shall
cease to be Registrable Stock on such date on which all of the Registrable
Stock held by such Holder can be sold within a period of three months
pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the 1933 Act (or any similar provision
then in force).

  

 **2. _Demand Registration_.**

  

(a) _Request for Registration_. Subject to the provisions contained in this
Section 2, beginning on the day after the Closing Date, one or more Holders
of more than 5% of the Registrable Stock then outstanding (each, a " **
_Requesting Holder_** ") may, from time to time, request in writing (a " **
_Demand Request_** ") that First Avenue effect the registration under the
1933 Act of a specified number of Registrable Stock held by the Requesting
Holders, specifying the intended method of distribution thereof if other than
pursuant to an underwritten offering (a " ** _Demand Registration_** "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that First Avenue will in no event be required to
effect more than three (3) Demand Registrations in total; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that First Avenue will in no event be required to effect
more than one (1) Demand Registration in any 12-month period; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that First Avenue will not be obligated to take any action
to effect any Demand Registration within 90 days immediately following
the effective date of any registration statement pertaining to an
underwritten public offering of equity securities of First Avenue for its own
account (except pursuant to registrations on Form S-4 or any successor
form or on Form S-8 or any successor form relating solely to
securities issued pursuant to any benefit plan). Subject to Section 4 below,
upon receipt of a Demand Request, First Avenue will cause to be included in
a registration statement on an appropriate form under the 1933 Act, filed
with the SEC as promptly

     

   

as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 90 days after
receiving a Demand Request, such Registrable Stock as may be requested by
such Requesting Holders in their Demand Request together with any other
Registrable Stock of the same class as requested by Joining Holders
(as defined below) joining in such request pursuant to Section 2(b)
hereof. First Avenue shall use its reasonable efforts to cause any such
registration statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing but in any event not later than 150 days
following the date of the Demand Request.

  

(b) _Joining Holders_. If at any time First Avenue proposes to register
Registrable Stock for the account of the Requesting Holders pursuant to
Section 2(a) hereof, then (i) First Avenue shall give, or cause to be given,
written notice of such proposed filing to all the Holders as soon as
practicable (but in no event less than 30 days before the anticipated filing
date). Upon the written request of any Holder, received by First Avenue no
later than the 10th Business Day after receipt by such Holder of the notice
sent First Avenue (each such Holder, a " ** _Joining Holder_** " and,
collectively with the Requesting Holders, the " ** _Participating Holders_**
"), to register, on the same terms and conditions as the securities otherwise
being sold pursuant to such Demand Registration, any of its Registrable Stock
of the same class as the securities otherwise being sold pursuant to such
Demand Registration, First Avenue will use its reasonable efforts to cause
such Registrable Stock to be included in the registration statement proposed
to be filed by First Avenue on the same terms and conditions as any
securities of the same class included therein.

  

(c) _Effective Registration_. A registration will not count as a Demand
Registration unless the related registration statement has been declared
effective and has remained effective until the earlier of (i) such time as
all of such Registrable Securities covered thereby have been disposed of in
accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Participating
Holders (but in no event for a period of more than 90 days after such
registration statement becomes effective) or (ii) the expiration of the time
when a prospectus relating to such registration is required to be delivered
under the 1933 Act; it being understood that if, after it has become
effective, an offering of Registrable Stock pursuant to a registration
statement is terminated by any stop order, injunction, or other order of the
SEC or other governmental agency or court, such registration pursuant thereto
will be deemed not to have been effected and will not count as a Demand
Registration for purposes of Section 2(a).

  

(e) _Priority on Demand Registrations_. With respect to any offering of
Registrable Stock pursuant to a Demand Registration in the form of an
underwritten offering, no securities to be sold for the account of any person
(including First Avenue) other than the Participating Holders exercising
registration rights shall be included in a Demand Registration unless the
managing underwriter advises the Requesting Holders that the inclusion of
such securities will not adversely affect the price or success of the
offering (an " ** _Adverse Effect_** "). Furthermore, in the event that the
managing underwriter advises the Requesting Holders in writing that the
amount of Registrable Stock proposed to be included in such Demand
Registration by the Participating Holders is sufficiently large (even after
exclusion of all securities of any other person pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence) to cause an Adverse Effect, the number of Registrable
Stock to be included in such Demand Registration shall be allocated among all
such Participating Holders exercising registration rights therewith effected
pro rata based on the ratio that the number of Registrable Stock that each
such Holder

     

   

requested to be included in such registration statement, as the case may be,
bears to the amount represented by the total number of Registrable Stock that
all Holders requested to be included in such registration statement.

  

 **3. _Piggyback Registrations_.**

  

(a) _Holder Piggyback Registration_. If First Avenue proposes to file
a registration statement under the 1933 Act with respect to an offering of
any equity securities for First Avenues own account (except pursuant
to registrations on Form S-4 or any successor form or on Form S-8 or any
successor form relating solely to securities issued pursuant to any benefit
plan) on a form that would permit registration of Registrable Stock for sale
to the public under the 1933 Act, then (i) First Avenue shall give written
notice of such proposed filing to the Holders as soon as practicable (but in
no event less than 20 days before the anticipated filing date), describing in
reasonable detail the proposed registration (including the number and class
of securities proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such
registration statement, any proposed means of distribution of
such securities, any proposed managing underwriter of such securities and a
good faith estimate by First Avenue of the proposed maximum offering price of
such securities as such price is proposed to appear on the facing page of
such registration statement), and offering such Holders the opportunity to
register such number of Registrable Stock as each such Holder may request.
Upon the written request of any Holder, received by First Avenue no later
than 10 Business Days after receipt by such Holder of the notice sent by
First Avenue, to register, on the same terms and conditions as the securities
otherwise being sold pursuant to such registration, any of such Holders
Registrable Stock of the same class as those being registered (which request
shall state the intended method of disposition thereof if the securities
otherwise being sold are being sold by more than one method of disposition),
First Avenue will use its reasonableefforts to cause such Registrable Stock
as to which registration shall have been so requested to be included in the
registration statement proposed to be filed by First Avenue on the same terms
and conditions as any similar securities included therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ _,_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, First Avenue may at any
time, in its sole discretion, without the consent of any other Holder, delay
or abandon the proposed offering in which any Holder had requested to
participate pursuant to this Section 3(a) or cease the filing (or obtaining
or maintaining the effectiveness) of or withdraw the related registration
statement or other governmental approvals, registrations or qualifications.
In such event, First Avenue shall so notify each Holder that had notified
First Avenue in accordance with this Section 3(a) of its intention to
participate in such offering and First Avenue shall incur no liability for
its failure to complete any such offering.

  

(b) _Priority on Piggyback Registrations_. If the Registrable Stock
requested to be included in a registration statement by any Holder pursuant
to Section 3(a) hereof differ from the type of securities proposed to be
registered by First Avenue and the managing underwriter for the related
underwritten offering advises First Avenue in writing that due to such
differences the inclusion of such Registrable Stock would cause an Adverse
Effect, and First Avenue notifies such Holder in writing of such advice, then
(i) the number of such Holders Registrable Stock to be included in the
registration statement shall be reduced to an amount which, in the judgment
of such managing underwriter, would eliminate such Adverse Effect or (ii) if
no such reduction would, in the judgment of such managing underwriter,
eliminate such Adverse Effect, then First Avenue shall have the right to
exclude all such Registrable Stock from such registration statement;
___provided_ ,  _however_ , that no other securities that are the same as, or
similar to, the

     

   

Registrable Stock that have been requested to be included in a registration
statement by any Holder pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof are included and
offered for the account of any other person (other than First Avenue) in such
registration statement. Any partial reduction in the number of Registrable
Stock to be included in the registration statement pursuant to clause (i) of
the immediately preceding sentence shall be effected pro rata based on the
ratio that the number of Registrable Stock that each such Holder requested to
be included in such registration statement, as the case may be, bears to the
amount represented by the total number of Registrable Stock that all Holders
requested to be included in such registration statement. If the Registrable
Stock requested to be included in the registration statement pursuant to
Section 3(a) hereof are of the same type as the securities being registered
by First Avenue and the managing underwriter advises First Avenue in writing
that the inclusion of such Registrable Stock would cause an Adverse Effect,
and First Avenue notifies the requesting Holders in writing of such advice,
then First Avenue will be obligated to only include in such registration
statement that number of Registrable Stock, if any, which, in the judgment of
the managing underwriter, would not have an Adverse Effect. Any partial
reduction in the number of Registrable Stock to be included in a registration
statement pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be affected
pro rata based on the ratio that the number of Registrable Stock that each
such Holder requested to be included in such registration statement, as the
case may be, bears to the amount represented by the total number
of Registrable Stock that all Holders requested to be included in
such registration statement.

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 3(b) hereof, if after a Demand
Request by the Holders pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof, First Avenue
first initiates a proposal to register securities for its own account
pursuant to this Section 3, then the Demand Registration requested pursuant
to Section 2(a) hereof shall be given priority.

  

(c) _Withdrawals_. Each Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request
for inclusion of its Registrable Stock in any registration statement pursuant
to this Section 3 by giving written notice to First Avenue of its request to
withdraw; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) such request must be made in
writing prior to the earlier of the execution of the underwriting agreement
or the execution of the custody agreement with respect to such registration
and (ii) such withdrawal shall be irrevocable.

  

(d) _Underwritten Offerings_. In connection with the exercise of any
registration rights granted to Holders pursuant to this Section 3, if the
registration is to be effected by means of an underwritten offering, First
Avenue may condition participation in such registration by such Holders upon
inclusion of the Registrable Stock being so registered in such underwriting.
In addition, such Holders may request that such Registrable Stock be included
in any underwritten offering of Common Stock (whether or not on a firm
commitment basis).

  

With respect to any offering of Registrable Stock pursuant to this Section 3
in the form of an underwritten offering, First Avenue shall select an
investment banking firm of national standing to be the managing underwriter
for the offering.

  

 **4. _Suspension and Standstill Periods_.**

  

(a) Suspension Period. After receipt of a Demand Request, First Avenue may,
by notice in writing to each Holder, postpone the filing or effectiveness of
any registration

     

   

requested pursuant to this Agreement, suspend the Demand Registration rights
of the Holders or require the Holders to suspend the use of any resale
prospectus included in the registration statement covering the Registrable
Stock, for any period of time determined by First Avenue if there shall occur
a Material Disclosure Event (such period, a " ** _Suspension Period_** ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Suspension Period shall exceed 90 days in
any one instance and First Avenue may not exercise its rights set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence more than twice in any 12-month period.
Each Holder agrees that, upon receipt of notice from First Avenue of the
occurrence of a Material Disclosure Event (a " ** _Suspension Notice_** "),
such Holder will forthwith discontinue any disposition of Registrable Stock
pursuant to the registration statement or any public sale or distribution,
including pursuant to Rule 144, until the earlier of (i) the expiration of
the Suspension Period and (ii) such Holders receipt of a notice from
First Avenue to the effect that such suspension has terminated. Any
Suspension Notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of the President or
any Vice President of First Avenue confirming the existence of the Material
Disclosure Event. If so directed by First Avenue, such Holder will deliver to
First Avenue (at First Avenues expense) all copies, other than permanent
file copies, then in such Holders possession, of the most recent prospectus
covering such Registrable Stock at the time of receipt of such Suspension
Notice. In the event of a Suspension Notice, First Avenue shall, promptly
after such time as the related Material Disclosure Event no longer exists,
take any and all actions necessary or desirable to give effect to any
Holders rights under this Agreement that may have been affected by such
notice, including the Holders Demand Registration rights.

  

(b) Holder Standstill Period. Each Holder agrees not to, without the prior
written consent of the managing underwriter for any underwritten offering of
(i) securities of First Avenue that are the same as, or similar to, the
Registrable Stock, or (ii) any securities convertible into, or exchangeable
or exercisable for, securities of First Avenue that are the same as, or
similar to, the Registrable Stock, effect any disposition (except for
dispositions included in, or pursuant to, such an underwritten offering)
pursuant to any registration statement or any public sale or distribution,
including pursuant to Rule 144, of any Registrable Stock or any securities
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any securities of First
Avenue that are the same as, or similar to, the Registrable Stock, during the
period commencing 15 days prior to the effective date of any registration
statement relating to such securities of First Avenue (to the extent timely
notified in writing (prior to such Holder giving any Demand Request) by First
Avenue or the managing underwriter) and ending on the first to occur of (A)
the 90th day after such effective date and (B) the end of the public
distribution of such securities of First Avenue.

  

 **5. Obligations of First Avenue. **First Avenue shall:

  

(a) prepare and file with the SEC any required supplements to the prospectus
used in connection with the registration statement as may be necessary to
comply with the provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the disposition of
all Registrable Stock covered by the registration statement for the period
required to effect the distribution of the Registrable Stock as set forth in
Section 2;

  

(b) furnish to each Holder such number of copies of the registration
statementand each amendment thereto, the prospectus included in such
registration statement (including each preliminary prospectus and each
prospectus supplement thereto) and the documents incorporated by reference
into such registration statement or prospectus, as applicable in

     

   

conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act, as such Holder may
reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of all or any of the Registrable Stock by such Holder;

  

(c) use all reasonable efforts to register or qualify the Registrable Stock
covered by the registration statement under the securities or Blue Sky laws
of such jurisdiction within the United States as shall be reasonably
requested by the Holders for the distribution of the Registrable Stock
covered by the registration statement; provided, however, that First Avenue
shall not be required to qualify to do business in, to file a general consent
to service of process or to subject itself to material taxation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not but for the requirements of this paragraph
(c) be obligated to do so; and _provided_ , _further_ , that First Avenue
shall not be required to qualify such Registrable Stock in any jurisdiction
in which the securities regulatory authority requires that the Holders submit
any of his or her Registrable Stock to the terms, provisions and restrictions
of any escrow, lockup or similar agreement(s) for consent to sell Registrable
Stock in such jurisdiction unless the Holders agree to do so;

  

(d) take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure that the Registrable
Stock continue to be listed and available for quotation on The Nasdaq
National Market or such other market as may be the principal market on which
First Avenue Common Shares are quoted or listed; and

  

(e) promptly notify the Holders, at any time when a prospectus or prospectus
supplement relating thereto is required to be delivered under the 1933 Act,
upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which,
the prospectus included in the registration statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading and, at the request of any Holder, promptly prepare and
furnish to such Holder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to such
prospectus, or a revised prospectus, as may be necessary so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Stock, such
prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, that in the event of a Material Disclosure
Event, First Avenue shall be entitled to defer preparing and furnishing such
supplement or amendment until the end of the applicable Suspension Period, at
which time it shall so notify the Holders and shall prepare and furnish to
the Holders any such supplement or amendment as may then be required.
Following receipt of any supplement to any prospectus, the Holders shall
deliver such supplement or revised prospectus in connection with any offers
or sales of Registrable Stock, and shall not deliver or use any prospectus
not so amended, supplemented or revised. Following delivery of notice that
First Avenue is preparing and filing with the SEC a supplement to the
prospectus, the Holders shall not make any further sales of Registrable
Stock pursuant to the registration statement until the Holders receive
such supplementfrom First Avenue.

  

 **6. _Obligations of Holder_. **Each Holder shall:

  

(a) furnish to First Avenue such information regarding itself, the
Registrable Stock held by it and the intended method of disposition of such
securities as First Avenue shall reasonably request and as shall be required
in connection with the actions to be taken by First

     

   

Avenue hereunder, which shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of
First Avenue to include Registrable Stock of a Holder in the registration
statement;

  

(b) promptly notify First Avenue of any changes in the information set forth
in the registration statement and any related prospectus, prospectus
supplement or document incorporated by reference therein regarding such
Holder or its plan of distribution, and shall not use, distribute or
otherwise disseminate any free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405
under the 1933 Act in connection with the sale of Registrable Stock under the
registration statement, without the prior consent of First Avenue; and

  

(c) not disclose any information obtained by such Holder in connection with
this Agreement, and shall not use any such information as the basis for any
market transactions in the securities of First Avenue or its Affiliates,
unless and until such information is made generally available to the public.

  

 **7. _Expenses_. **All expenses incurred in connection with the
registration pursuant to this Agreement, excluding underwriters or brokers
fees, discounts and commissions, but including, without limitation, all
registration, filing and qualification fees, word processing, duplicating,
printers and accounting fees, listing fees, messenger and delivery expenses,
all fees and expenses of complying with state securities or Blue Sky laws,
the fees and disbursements of counsel for First Avenue and reasonable fees
and expenses of not more than one counsel for the Participating Holders (as a
group), shall be paid by First Avenue. Each Holder shall bear and pay all
underwriting fees, discounts and commissions and brokerage fees, any out-of-
pocket expenses of such Holder, including any fees and expenses of counsel to
such Holder (other than as set forth in the prior sentence), and any
applicable transfer taxes applicable to securities offered for his or her
account in connection with any registrations, filings and qualifications made
pursuant to this Agreement.

  

 **8. _Transfer of Registration Rights_. **Subject to the terms of any Lock-
Up Agreement among the Holder, First Avenue and FiberTower, the registration
rights of a Holder under this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Stock
may be transferred or assigned to (a) any transferee or assignee of such
Registrable Stock who acquires, as a result of such transfer or assignment,at
least (i) 20% (calculated at the time of such transfer or assignment) of such
Holders Registrable Stock or (ii) 5,000 shares of the Registrable Stock
previously held by such Holder, whichever is greater, or (b) an Affiliate of
such Holder; provided, however, that (i) such Holder shall give First Avenue
written notice prior to the time of such transfer stating the name and
address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to
which the rights under this Agreement are being transferred; (ii)
such transferee shall agree in writing, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to First Avenue, to be bound as a Holder by the
provisions of this Agreement; and (iii) immediately following such transfer
the further disposition of such securities by such transferee is restricted
under the 1933 Act; and provided, further, that no Holder shall be entitled
to designate any such transferee if the Registrable Stock would continue to
be Registrable Stock for a period longer than would be the case in the hands
of such Holder or any of its Affiliates.

  

 **9. _Indemnification_. **In the event any Registrable Stock is included in
a registration statement under this Agreement:

     

   

(a) _Indemnification by First Avenue_. First Avenue shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Holder, such Holders directors and officers, any selling agent
selected by such Holder with respect to the offering of such Registrable
Stock, including underwriters (as defined in the 1933 Act), and each person,
if any, who controls such Holder or selling agent within the meaning of
Section 15 of the 1933 Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become subject under the
1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
registration statement or any preliminary or final prospectus included
therein (including any free-writing prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
1933 Act or any amendments or supplements thereto) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the case of any prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; and First Avenue shall reimburse each such Holder,
such Holders directors and officers, and such selling agent or controlling
person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 9(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement
of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is
effected without the consent of First Avenue; provided, further, that First
Avenue shall have no obligation to provide indemnification hereunder for any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in the registration statement, preliminary
or final prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any
such Holder or such Holders directors and officers, participating person or
controlling person, expressly for use in connection with such registration.
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any such Holder, such Holders
directors and officers, participating person or controlling person, and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder and any termination of
this Agreement.

  

(b) _Indemnification by the Holders_. Each Holder severally and not jointly
shall indemnify and hold harmless First Avenue, each of its directors and
officers, each person, if any, who controls First Avenue within the meaning
of Section 15 of the 1933 Act, and each agent and any underwriter (within the
meaning of the 1933 Act) for First Avenue against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities, joint or several, to which First Avenue or any such director,
officer, controlling person, agent or underwriter may become subject under
the 1933 Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
the registration statement or any preliminary or final prospectus included
therein (including any free-writing prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
1933 Act or any amendments or supplements thereto) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the case of any prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in the registration statement, preliminary or final
prospectus, or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such Holder
expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such Holder
shall

     

   

reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by First Avenue or
any such director, officer, controlling person, agent or underwriter in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 9(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement
of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such settlement is
effected without the consent of such Holder; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
the aggregate liability of each Holder hereunder shall be limited to an
amount equal to the net proceeds (after deducting any underwriting or
brokers discounts or commissions but before deducting expenses) received by
such Holder from the sale of Registrable Stock covered by such registration
statement.

  

(c) _Notice of Claims, Etc_. Promptly after receipt by any person entitled to
indemnity underSection 9(a) or (b) hereof, of notice of the commencement of
any action or proceeding involving a claim referred to in such sections, such
indemnified party shall, if indemnification is sought against an indemnifying
party under this Section 9, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to
participate in and assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that an indemnified party shall have the right to
retain its own counsel, with all fees and expenses thereof to be paid by such
indemnified party. The failure to notify an indemnifying party promptly of
the commencement of any such action, if and to the extent prejudicial to its
ability to defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any
liability to the indemnified party under this Section 9, but the omission so
to notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it
may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 9\.
Anything in this Section 9(c) to the contrary notwithstanding, an
indemnifying party shall not be liable for the settlement of any action
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed), but if settled with the prior written
consent of the indemnifying party, or if there shall be a final judgment
adverse to the indemnified party, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify
the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of
such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
consent of the indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise, with respect to any pending or threatened
action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be
sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual
or potential party to such action or claim), which (i) does not include as
a term thereof the unconditional release of the indemnified party from
all liability in respect of such action or claim or (ii) includes a
statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act,
by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

  

(d) _Contribution_. To the extent any indemnification by an indemnifying
party is prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the
actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault
of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and
the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to

   

G-10   

 

  

information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount
paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other
fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding.

  

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 9(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

  

 **10. _General Provisions_.**

  

(a) _Notices_. Any notice, request or other communication required or
permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given if personally delivered, transmitted by facsimile, delivered by
nationally recognized overnight courier or if deposited in the U.S. mail by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.
Notices shall be delivered at the addresses set forth below such partys name
on the signature pages hereto. Any party hereto may by notice so given change
its address or facsimile number for future notices hereunder. Notice shall
conclusively be deemed to have been given when personally delivered or on the
third business day after deposit in the mail in the manner set forth above.

  

(b) _Deemed Underwriter; Due Diligence_. First Avenue agrees that, if
Goldman, Sachs and Co. (" ** _Goldman Sachs_** "), or any affiliate thereof
(together with Goldman Sachs, any " ** _GS Entity_** ") could reasonably be
deemed to be an "underwriter," as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the 1933
Act, in connection with any registration of First Avenues securities held by
any GS Entity pursuant to this Agreement, and any amendment or supplement
thereof (any such registration statement or amendment or supplement a " **
_GS Underwriter Registration Statement_** "), then First Avenue
will cooperate with such GS Entity in allowing such GS Entity to conduct
customary "underwriters due diligence" with respect to First Avenue and
satisfy any obligations in respect thereof. In addition, at Goldman Sachs
request, First Avenue will furnish to Goldman Sachs, on the date of the
effectiveness of any GS Underwriter Registration Statement and thereafter
from time to time on such dates as Goldman Sachs may reasonably request (i) a
letter, dated such date, from the First Avenues independent certified public
accountants in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
certified public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, addressed to Goldman Sachs, and (ii) an opinion, dated as of such
date, of counsel representing First Avenue for purposes of such GS
Underwriter Registration Statement, in form, scope and substance as is
customarily given in an underwritten public offering, including, without
limitation, a standard "10b-5" opinion for such offering, addressed to
Goldman Sachs. First Avenue will also permit legal counsel to Goldman Sachs
to review and comment upon any such GS Underwriter Registration Statement at
least five business days prior to its filing with the SEC and all amendments
and supplements to any such GS Underwriter Registration Statement within a
reasonable number of days prior to their filing with the SEC and not file any
GS Underwriter Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto in a
form to which Goldman Sachs legal counsel reasonably objects.

     

   

(c) _Entire Agreement; Independence of Obligations_. This Agreement
constitutes and contains the entire agreement and understanding of the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all
prior negotiations, correspondence, agreements, understandings, duties or
obligations between the parties respecting the subject matter hereof.

  

(d) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
conflicts of law principles.

  

(e) _Severability_. If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to
be unenforceable under applicable law, then such provision(s) shall be
excluded from this Agreement and the balance of this Agreement shall be
interpreted as if such provision(s) were so excluded and shall be enforceable
in accordance with its terms.

  

(f) _Third Parties_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any person, other than the parties hereto and their
successors and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  

(g) _Successors and Assigns_. Subject to the provisions of Section 8,
the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall
be binding upon, the successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.

together shall constitute one instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of this Agreement by facsimile shall be effective to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.

  

(j) _Costs and Attorneys  Fees_. In the event that any action, suit or other
proceeding is instituted concerning or arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereunder, the prevailing party shall recover all of
such partys costs and attorneys fees incurred in each such action, suit or
other proceeding, including any and all appeals or petitions therefrom.

  

(k) _Adjustments for Stock Splits, Etc._ Wherever in this Agreement there is
a reference to a specific number of shares of First Avenue Common Shares,
then, upon the occurrence of any subdivision, combination or share dividend
of such class of shares, the specific number of shares so referenced in this
Agreement shall automatically be proportionally adjusted to reflect the
effect on the outstanding shares of such class or series of shares by such
subdivision, combination or share dividend.

     

   

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Registration Rights
Agreement as of the date first above written.
