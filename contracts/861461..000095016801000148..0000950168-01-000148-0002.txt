OF THE MERGER. Newco shall merge  with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of  Newco shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). The
Company shall be the  surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to  as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue
to be governed by  the laws of the State of North Carolina, and the separate
corporate  existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges,

The  Merger shall have the effects specified in the NCBCA.   (b) ARTICLES
OF INCORPORATION. The articles of incorporation  of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended to read in their entirety  the same as the articles of
incorporation of Newco as in effect  immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until duly amended in  accordance with the terms thereof and the NCBCA,
except that the name  of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to "RBC
Centura Banks,  Inc.".   (c) BY-LAWS. The by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be  amended to read in their entirety the same as the by-
laws of Newco as  in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
duly amended  in accordance with the terms thereof and the articles of
incorporation  referred to in Section 2.01(b).   (d) DIRECTORS. Unless
otherwise agreed by the Acquiror and the  Company, the directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be comprised  of nine individuals, five of whom
shall be designated by the Acquiror  and four of whom  -8-    shall be
designated by the Company (with the reasonable consent of the  Acquiror)
prior to the Effective Time, and such directors shall hold  office until such
time as their successors shall be duly elected and  qualified.   2.02
Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. At the Acquiror\'s election, the
Merger may alternatively be structured so that (i) the Company is merged with
and into any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror or
(ii) any other direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror is
merged with and into the Company; provided, however, that no such change
shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the Consideration or the
treatment of the holders of Company Stock Options, (b) prevent the
parties from obtaining the opinions of Hunton and Williams and Sullivan and
Cromwell referred to in Sections 7.02(c) and 7.03(c), respectively, or (c)

execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
election.   2.03 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing, in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of
North Carolina, of articles of merger in accordance with Section 55-11-05 of
the NCBCA, or at such later date and time as may be set forth in such
articles. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the parties shall cause the
Merger to become effective (1) on the date that is the third business day to
occur after the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
conditions relating solely to the delivery of documents dated the Closing
Date) shall have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement (or, at the election of the Acquiror, on the last business day
of the month in which such day occurs), or (2) on such date as the parties
may agree in writing (the "Closing Date").    ARTICLE III  
Consideration   3.01 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any shares of Company Common Stock:   (a) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON
STOCK. Each share of Company  Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall  be converted into the right to receive
consideration (the  "Consideration") comprising 1.684 (the "Exchange Ratio")
fully paid and  nonassessable shares of Acquiror Common Stock. At the
Effective Time,  the shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and  shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and
from and after  the Effective Time, certificates representing Company Common
Stock  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all 
purposes to represent the number of shares of Acquiror   -9-   Common
Stock into which they were converted as part of the  Consideration pursuant
to this Section 3.01(a).   (b) Newco Common Stock. Each share of Newco
common stock  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be  converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   3.02 Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. At
the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, shareholders of the Company, other than to receive
any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Company Common Stock
with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time and the conversion
rights provided under this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock.   3.03 Exchange Procedures. (a) Promptly
upon occurrence of the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Acquiror\'s transfer agent or a U.S. depository or
trust institution of recognized standing selected by the Acquiror and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in such capacity, the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates formerly representing
shares of Company Common Stock ("Old Certificates") to be exchanged in
accordance with this Article III, certificates representing the shares of
Acquiror Common Stock ("New Certificates").   (b) Promptly after the
Effective Time, the Acquiror shall send or cause to be sent to each former
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time transmittal materials for use in exchanging such
shareholder\'s Old Certificates for New Certificates. The Acquiror shall
cause the New Certificates and/or any check in respect of dividends or
distributions which such person shall be entitled to receive to be delivered
to such shareholder upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates
representing such shares of Company Common Stock (or indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to the Acquiror and the Exchange Agent, if any of
such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned by such shareholder.
No interest will be paid on the cash such person shall be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article III upon such delivery.   (c) Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of
Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (d)
From and after the 30th day following the Effective Time, no dividends or
other distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock with a record date
occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid in respect of
any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of Acquiror Common
Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of Acquiror
Common Stock. Upon surrender of Old Certificates (or indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to the Acquiror and the Exchange Agent, if any of such
certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) in accordance   -10-   with
this Section 3.03, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon,
which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Acquiror
Common Stock such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of Old
Certificates (or delivery of such indemnity).   (e) Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock and no
certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will
be issued in the Merger; instead, the Acquiror shall pay to each holder of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of
Acquiror Common Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates
delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fraction by the average of the last reported sale prices of
Acquiror Common Stock, as reported by the Toronto Stock Exchange, for the ten
Toronto Stock Exchange trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time
(with the last reported sale price for each such trading day converted to
U.S. dollars at the Bank of Canada Closing Rate in Toronto on such trading
day).   3.04 Anti-Dilution Provisions. If the Acquiror changes
(or establishes a record date for changing) the number or kind of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Acquiror Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.  
3.05 Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, exercisable or unexercisable, without any action
on the part of the holder shall be converted into the right to receive
payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the excess of the
Consideration Per Share over the exercise price per share subject to
such Company Stock Option and (2) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option payable to the holder of such Company Stock Option at
any time during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that the Company shall be
entitled to withhold from such cash payment any amounts required to be
withheld by applicable law. For purposes of clarity, if the exercise price
per share subject to a Company Stock Option exceeds the Consideration Per
Share (i.e., an "underwater" stock option) then, the holder of such option
shall not be entitled to any payment with respect thereto. Each Company Stock
Option to which this paragraph applies will be cancelled and shall cease to
exist by virtue of such payment. For the purposes of this Section 3.05,
"Consideration Per Share" means the product of (x) the average of the last
reported sale prices of Acquiror Common Stock, as reported by the Toronto
Stock Exchange, for the ten Toronto Stock Exchange trading days immediately
preceding the Effective Time (with the last reported sale price for each such
trading day converted to U.S. dollars at the Bank of Canada Closing Rate in
Toronto on such trading day) and (y) the Exchange Ratio. Prior to the
Effective Time the Company shall take all necessary actions, including
obtaining employee consents and resolutions of the Company Board or of a
committee established under a Company Stock Plan, if applicable, to effect
the foregoing.    -11-    ARTICLE IV   Actions Pending the Merger  
4.01 Forbearances of the Company. Until the Effective Time (or the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement), except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule, without the prior written consent of
the Acquiror, the Company will not, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to:   (a) ORDINARY COURSE. Conduct the business of the
Company and  its Subsidiaries other than in the ordinary and usual course or,
to the  extent consistent therewith, fail to use reasonable efforts to
preserve  intact their business organizations and assets and maintain their

plan, contract or arrangement maintained or  contributed to by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for the  benefit of current or former officers,
employees or directors or the  beneficiaries or dependents of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the  "Compensation Plans"), other than plans that
are not currently  maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (2) With respect to each Compensation Plan, if  applicable,
the Company has made available to the Acquiror, true and  complete copies of
the existing: (A) Compensation Plan documents and  amendments thereto; (B)
trust instruments and insurance contracts; (C)  two most recent Forms 5500
filed with the IRS; (D) most recent  actuarial report and financial
statement; (E) most recent summary plan  description; (F) forms filed with
the PBGC (other than for premium  payments); (G) most recent determination
letter issued by the IRS; (H)  any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS;
(I) most recent  nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the Code
(including  401(k) and 401(m) tests); and (J) documentation relating to
outstanding  loans made to the Company\'s employee stock ownership plan. Each
Form  5500, actuarial report and financial statement referred to in the 
preceding sentence accurately reflects the contributions, liabilities  and
funding levels of the applicable Compensation Plan.   (3) Each of the
Compensation Plans has been  administered and operated in accordance with the
terms thereof and with  applicable law, including ERISA, the Code and the
Securities Act. Each  of the Compensation Plans which is an "employee pension
benefit plan"  within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan")
and which  is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has 
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and the Company  is
not aware of any circumstances that would likely result in the  revocation or
denial of any such favorable determination letter. None  of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or an Indemnified Person has  engaged in any transaction
with respect to any Compensation Plan that  has subjected, or (assuming the
taxable period with respect to the  transaction expired as of the date
hereof) could subject the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section  4975 of the Code or   -23-   Section
502 of ERISA in an amount which would be material. There is no  pending or,
to the Company\'s knowledge, threatened litigation or  governmental audit,
examination or investigation relating to the  Company\'s Compensation Plans.
There are no outstanding loans made to  the Company\'s employee stock
ownership plan.   (4) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of 
ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of  its
Subsidiaries with respect to any "single-employer plan" (within the  meaning
of Section 4001 (a)(15) of ERISA) or Multiemployer Plan  currently or
formerly maintained or contributed to by any of them, or  the single-employer
plan or Multiemployer Plan of any entity (an "ERISA  Affiliate") which is
considered one employer with the Company under  Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA
or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an  "ERISA Affiliate Plan"). No notice
of a "reportable event," within the  meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting  requirement has not been waived or extended,
other than pursuant to  PBGC Reg. Section 4043.66, has been required to be
filed for any  Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month
period  ending on the date hereof. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings
to  terminate any Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan and, to the 
Company\'s knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material risk  that
such proceedings will be instituted. The Company and its  Subsidiaries have
not incurred and do not expect to incur any  withdrawal liability with
respect to a Multiemployer Plan under  Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA
(regardless of whether based on  contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).  
(5) All contributions, premiums and payments required  to have been made
under the terms of any of the Compensation Plans or  applicable law have been
timely made or reflected in the Company\'s SEC  Documents. Neither any of the
Pension Plans nor ERISA Affiliate Plans  has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (whether or not waived) within  the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA. None of  the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate has  provided, or is required to provide, security to
any Pension Plan or  any ERISA Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29)
or Section  412(n) of the Code.   (6) Under each Pension Plan which is a 
single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year  ended
prior to the date hereof, the actuarially determined present  value of all
"benefit liabilities," within the meaning of Section  4001(a)(16) of ERISA
(as determined on the basis of the actuarial  assumptions contained in the
Plan\'s most recent actuarial valuation),  did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such plan by  more than $10 million. Under each of the
Pension Plans, there has been  no adverse change in the financial condition
of any Pension Plan (with  respect to either assets or benefits) since the
last day of the most  recent plan year.   (7) No Compensation Plan provides
benefits, including  death or medical benefits, with respect to any employees
or former  employees of the   -24-   Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or their spouses, beneficiaries, or  dependents) beyond the retirement or
other termination of service of  any such employee other than (A) coverage
mandated by Part 6 of Title I  of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, (B)
retirement, death or  disability benefits under any Pension Plan, (C)
disability benefits  under any Compensation Plan which is an employee welfare
benefit plan  (as defined under Section 3(1) of ERISA) that have been fully
provided  for by insurance or otherwise, or (D) benefits in the nature of 
severance pay under any Compensation Plan. The Company and its  Subsidiaries
may amend or terminate any Compensation Plan which  provides post-retirement
or termination of employment benefits at any  time without incurring any
liability thereunder (other than liability  for vested, accrued benefits
under any Compensation Plan as of the date  of such amendment or
termination). There has been no communication to  employees, former employees
or their spouses, beneficiaries or  dependents by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that promised or  guaranteed such employees retiree health or
life insurance or other  retiree death benefits on a permanent basis or
promised or guaranteed  that any such benefits could not be modified,
eliminated or terminated.   (8) There has been no amendment to, announcement
by  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in 
employee participation or coverage under, any Compensation Plan which  would
increase the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level of  the expense
incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year. Neither  the execution of
this Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement  nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (w)  entitle any employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to  severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of  employment after the date hereof, (x)
accelerate the time of payment or  vesting or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or  otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount  payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of  the Compensation Plans, (y) cause the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries to record additional compensation expense on its income 
statement with respect to any outstanding stock option or other  equity-based
award or (z) result in payments under any of the  Compensation Plans which
would not be deductible under Section 162(m)  or Section 280G of the
Code.   (9) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  maintains any
compensation plans, programs or arrangements the payments  under which are or
would not reasonably be expected to be deductible as  a result of the
limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and the  regulations issued
thereunder.   (10) The retirement or disability benefit  historically paid
pursuant to each Supplemental Executive Retirement  Agreement has been
calculated based on the participant\'s base-salary  and annual
performance   -25-   bonuses paid to the participant, including amounts
voluntarily deferred  by a participant.   (o) LABOR MATTERS. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is  in compliance with all applicable laws
respecting employment and  employment practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and  hours, including, without limitation, the
Immigration Reform and  Control Act, any such laws respecting employment
discrimination,  disability rights or benefits, equal opportunity,
affirmative action,  workers\' compensation, employee benefits, severance
payments, labor  relations, employee leave issues, wage and hour standards,
occupational  safety and health requirements and unemployment insurance and
related  matters. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to  or is bound by any collective bargaining Contract or understanding with 
a labor union or labor organization, nor is the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any such 
Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning  of the
National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel the Company  or any such
Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to  wages or conditions
of employment, nor is there any strike or other  labor dispute involving it
or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to  the Company\'s knowledge,
threatened, nor is the Company aware of any  activity involving it or any of
its Subsidiaries\' employees seeking to  certify a collective bargaining unit
or engaging in other  organizational activity.   (p) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

Environmental Laws; (2) to  the Company\'s knowledge, no property (including

presence of  asbestos, underground storage tanks, contamination,
polychlorinated  biphenyls or gas station sites) that would reasonably be
expected to  result in any claims, liability or investigations or result in
any  restrictions on the ownership, use, or transfer of   -26-   any
property pursuant to any Environmental Law; and (8) the Company has  made
available to the Acquiror copies of all environmental reports,  studies,
sampling data, correspondence, filings and other environmental  information
in its possession or reasonably available to it relating to  the Company, any

timely filed, or requests for extensions have been timely  filed and have not
expired; (2) all Tax Returns filed by the Company  and its Subsidiaries are

FOR LOAN LOSSES. (1) All swaps,  caps, floors, option agreements, futures and
forward contracts and  other similar risk management arrangements, whether
entered into for  the Company\'s own account, or for the account of one or

entered into (1) in accordance with prudent  business practices and all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and  regulatory policies and (2) with
counterparties believed to be  financially responsible at the time; and each
of them constitutes the  valid and legally binding obligation of the Company
or one of its  Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except

approved by the Company\'s shareholders for consummation of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any adjournment or
postponement, the "Company Meeting"), and to solicit shareholder approval, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof. The Company Board has adopted
a resolution contemplated by NCBCA ss. 55-11-03, recommending that the
shareholders approve this Agreement (and will keep such resolution in effect)

circumstance.   -33-    6.03 Registration Statement. (a The Acquiror

issuance of Acquiror Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy
statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of the
Company constituting a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and all related

of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement; and, provided that the
Company and its Subsidiaries have cooperated as required above, the Acquiror
agrees to file the Proxy Statement in preliminary form with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and to file the Registration Statement
with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after any SEC comments with
respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement are resolved. Each of the Company
and the Acquiror agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the

promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof. The Acquiror also
agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees to furnish to
the Acquiror all information concerning the Company, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and shareholders as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing.   (b) Each of the Company and
the Acquiror agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (1) the Registration Statement will, at the time the
Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (2)
the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date
of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Company Meeting,

circumstances under which such statement is made, is false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to
correct any earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto. Each of the Company and the Acquiror further agrees that
if it shall become aware prior to the Effective Time of any information
furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement
to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.   (c) The Acquiror agrees to
advise the Company, promptly after the Acquiror receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or
the suspension of the qualification of the Acquiror Stock for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
any such   -34-  purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment
or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information.   6.04 Press Releases. The initial press release concerning
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Stock Option Agreement shall be a joint press release in such form agreed to
by the parties, and thereafter each of the Company and the Acquiror agrees
that it will not, without the prior approval of the other party, issue any
press release or written statement for general circulation relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby (except for any release or statement that,
in the written opinion of outside counsel to the Company or the Acquiror, as
the case may be, is required by law or regulation and as to which the Company
or the Acquiror, as the case may be, has used its best efforts to discuss
with the other in advance, provided that such release or statement has not
been caused by, or is not the result of, a previous disclosure by or at the
direction of the Company or the Acquiror, as the case may be, or any of its
representatives that was not permitted by this Agreement).   6.05 Access;
Information. (a Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford the
Acquiror and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives, such access during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books,
records (including, without limitation, credit files, tax returns and work
papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other
information as it may reasonably request and, during such period, the Company
shall furnish promptly (1) a copy of each material report, schedule and other
document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities or banking laws, and (2) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably request.  
(b) Each of the Company and the Acquiror agrees that it will not, and will
cause its representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.05 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements
of law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives
to keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.05 unless such information (1) was already known to such
party, (2) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by
such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (3) is disclosed with
the prior written approval of the party to which such information pertains or
(4) is or becomes readily ascertainable from published information or trade
sources. In the event that this Agreement is terminated or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be consummated, each
party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or extracts thereof
containing information and data as to another party hereto to be returned to
the party which furnished the same, or at the other party\'s request,
destroyed.   (c) No investigation by either party of the business
and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
any representation, warranty,   -35-  covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to either party\'s obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    6.06 Acquisition Proposals.
The Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and its Subsidiaries\' representatives not to, solicit or encourage
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information to, or have any
discussions with, any person relating to, any tender or exchange offer,
proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the
assets or deposits of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Stock Option Agreement
(any of the foregoing, an "Acquisition Proposal"); provided, that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from (i) making
any disclosure to its shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its
obligations under applicable law; (ii) until the date of the Company Meeting,
providing (or authorizing the provision of) information to, or engaging in
(or authorizing) such discussions or negotiations with, any person who
has made a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal received after the date
hereof which did not result from a breach of this Section 6.06; or (iii)
recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders if and only to
the extent that, in the case of actions referred to in clause (ii) or (iii),
(x) such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (y) the Company Board,
after having consulted with and considered the advice of outside counsel to
the Company Board, determines in good faith that providing such information
or engaging in such negotiations or discussions, or making such
recommendation is required in order to discharge the directors\' fiduciary
duties in accordance with the NCBCA and (z) the Company receives from such
person a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of the
Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior
Proposal" means any Acquisition Proposal by a third party on terms that the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after receiving the
advice of its financial advisors (whose advice shall be communicated to the
Acquiror), to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its
shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction
on the terms set forth therein, taking into account all legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted
under applicable law, after giving the Acquiror at least five business days
to respond to such third-party Acquisition Proposal once the Board has
notified the Acquiror that in the absence of any further action by the
Acquiror it would consider such Acquisition Proposal to be a Superior
Proposal, and then taking into account any amendment or modification to this
Agreement proposed by the Acquiror. The Company also agrees immediately to
cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties other than the
Acquiror, with respect to any of the foregoing. The Company shall promptly
(within 24 hours) advise the Acquiror following the receipt by it of any
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms thereof (including the identity
of   -36-   the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and advise the
Acquiror of any developments (including any change in such terms) with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal promptly upon the occurrence
thereof.   Nothing contained in this Section 6.06 or any other provision of
this Agreement will prohibit the Company or the Company Board from
notifying any third party that contacts the Company on an unsolicited basis
after the date hereof concerning an Acquisition Proposal of the Company\'s
obligations under this Section 6.06.   6.07 Affiliate Agreements. Not later
than the 15th day prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company
shall deliver to the Acquiror a schedule of each person that, to the
Company\'s knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the
Company Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of it (each, a "Company
Affiliate") as that term is used in Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The
Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who
may be deemed to be a Company Affiliate to execute and deliver to the Company
and the Acquiror on or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement an
agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.   6.08 Takeover Laws. No
party shall knowingly take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect.   6.09 No Rights Triggered. The Company shall take all reasonable
steps necessary to ensure that the entering into of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and any other action or
combination of actions, or any other transactions contemplated hereby, do not
and will not result in the grant of any rights to any person (a) under the
Company Articles or the Company By-Laws or (b) under any material Contract to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party except, in each case,
as contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement.   6.10
NYSE Listing. The Acquiror shall take all reasonable steps necessary to
ensure the listing, prior to the Effective Time, on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
to the holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger.   6.11 Regulatory
Applications. (a The Acquiror and the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Acquiror shall have the
right to review in advance, and to the extent   -37-   practicable to
consult with the Company, subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, with respect to, all material written information submitted
to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall have the right
to review in advance, and to the extent practicable to consult with
the Acquiror, subject to all applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, with respect to, all material written information submitted
to any third party or any Governmental Authority, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that is not confidential. In
exercising the foregoing rights, the Acquiror and the Company agree to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each of the Acquiror and the
Company agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect
to the obtaining of all material consents, registrations, approvals, permits
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of
material matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.   (b) Each of the Acquiror and the Company agrees, upon request, to
furnish the other party with all information concerning itself,
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of such other party or any of its
Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental Authority.   6.12
Indemnification. (a) Following the Effective Time and for a period of six
years thereafter, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each,
an "Indemnified Party") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company is permitted
to indemnify its directors, officers and employees under applicable law, the
Company Articles and the Company By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof (and
the Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law
provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification); provided that any determination required to be
made with respect to whether such an officer\'s or director\'s conduct
complies with the standards set forth under the NCBCA, the Company Articles
and the Company By-Laws shall be made by independent counsel
reasonably acceptable to both the Indemnified Party and the Surviving
Corporation.   -38-    (b) For a period of three years from the Effective
Time, the Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide (or cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide) that portion of director\'s and
officer\'s liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the same coverage and
amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous, as that
coverage currently provided by the Company; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Acquiror be required to expend more than twice the current
amount spent by the Company (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain or procure
such directors\' and officers\' insurance coverage; provided, further, that
if the Acquiror is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this Section 6.12(b), the Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount;
provided, further, that officers and directors of the Company or any
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the Acquiror\'s insurance carrier for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance.   (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under Section 6.12(a), upon learning of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation described above, shall promptly
notify the Acquiror thereof; provided that the failure so to notify shall not
affect the obligations of the Acquiror under Section 6.12(a) unless and to
the extent that the Acquiror is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (1) the
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the
defense thereof and the Acquiror shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if the Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified
Parties advises that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest
between the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements
therefor are received; provided, however, that the Acquiror shall be
obligated pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, (2) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any
such matter and (3) the Acquiror shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; and provided, further, that the Acquiror shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law.    -39-    (d) If the Acquiror or any
of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its
assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Acquiror shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.   6.13 Accountants\' Letters.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
the Acquiror, and the Acquiror\'s directors and officers who sign the
Registration Statement, letters of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent

the Acquiror, and such directors and officers, in form and substance
customary for "comfort" letters delivered by independent accountants in
accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 72.   6.14
Notification of Certain Matters. Each of the Company and the Acquiror shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (1) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (2) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained herein.    6.15 Employee Benefits. (a) The Acquiror agrees to
permit or cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to take appropriate action to
honor all Compensation Plans in accordance with their terms. The Acquiror
agrees that, except as otherwise specifically provided, the employee benefit
plans maintained by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, will continue until at least December 31, 2002. Thereafter, the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries on or before the Effective Time will be provided
employee pension, welfare and other benefits, fringes, and perquisites that
are generally comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Acquiror
to similarly situated employees of the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. The
Acquiror will cause each employee benefit plan of the Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are
eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of eligibility and
vesting thereunder, but not for purposes of benefit accrual, the service of
such employees with the Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were
with the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service
was credited under a comparable plan of the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries.
Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be subject to any
waiting periods or pre-existing condition limitations under the
medical, dental and health plans of the Acquiror or its Subsidiaries in which
they are eligible to participate. Employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries will retain credit for unused sick leave and vacation pay which
has been accrued as of the Effective Time and for purposes of determining the
entitlement of such employees to sick leave and vacation pay following the
Effective Time, the service of such employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be treated as if such service was with the Acquiror and
its Subsidiaries.   -40-    (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries will
comply with the terms of the relevant Compensation Plan with respect to the
voting of any Company Common Stock held by any such Plan. As mutually agreed
by the Company and the Acquiror, the Company\'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan
feature of the Company\'s 401(k) Plan may be terminated, amended, or
discontinued as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
Plan and the requirements of applicable law.   (c) As soon as practicable
following the date hereof, the Company will grant retention bonus awards to
the key employees designated by the Acquiror, on terms, in form and in
amounts satisfactory to the Acquiror.   (d) The Company shall freeze
additional benefit accrual in its defined benefit pension plan by resolution
of the Company Board and all necessary plan amendments, at least fifteen days
prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall also make such other amendments
as are necessary to effect the changes set forth on Company Disclosure
Schedule 401(e) with respect to retirement plans.   (e) Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall use its best efforts to take the actions set
forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule Section 4.01(e) with respect to
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreements.   6.16 Certain
Adjustments. Upon the request of the Acquiror, the Company shall (a)
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and regulatory
accounting principles, use its best efforts to record any accounting
adjustments required to conform the loan, litigation and other reserve and
real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications
and levels of reserves) of the Company and its Subsidiaries so as to reflect
consistently on a mutually satisfactory basis the policies and practices of
the Acquiror and (b) make reasonable adjustments to the corporate structure
of the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries and transfer assets or
liabilities between the Company and its Subsidiaries or between Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to record any such
accounting adjustments (1) unless and until the Company shall be satisfied
that the conditions to the obligation of the parties to consummate the Merger
will be satisfied or waived on or before the Closing Date, and (2) in
no event until the day prior to the Closing Date.   6.17 Formation of
Newco. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Acquiror shall cause Newco to be duly organized as a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of the Acquiror and to become a party to this Agreement by
executing and delivering a supplement hereto.   6.18 Certain Tax Matters.
Each of the Acquiror and the Company (i) shall cooperate before and after the
Effective Time to assure, to the extent feasible, compliance with Treasury
Regulation ss. 1.367(a)-3(c), (ii) undertakes and agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger, and to take no action that is
reasonably likely to cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for federal income tax
purposes, and (iii) for purposes of   -41-   the tax opinions described
in Section 7.02(c) and 7.03(c), shall provide representation letters to
counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Acquiror, the
Company and such counsel.     ARTICLE VII   Conditions to Consummation

respective Subsidiaries, shall have been obtained or  made and shall be in
full force and effect and all waiting periods  required by law shall have
expired; provided, however, that none of the  preceding shall be deemed
obtained or made if it shall be subject to  any condition or restriction the

Surviving Corporation or the  Acquiror or its operations in the U.S. after
the Effective Time.   (c) THIRD PARTY CONSENTS. All consents or approvals of
all  persons, other than Governmental Authorities, required for or in 
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this  Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger shall have been obtained  and shall be in

a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving  Corporation.   (d) NO
INJUNCTION. No Governmental Authority of competent  jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or  entered any statute, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or  other order (whether temporary,

subject to the fulfillment or written waiver by the Company prior to the
Effective Time of each of the following conditions:   (a) REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES. Subject to the standard  set forth in Section 5.02, the
representations and warranties of the  Acquiror set forth in this Agreement
shall be true and correct as of  the date of this Agreement and as of the

shareholders of the Company to the extent they receive shares of  Acquiror
Common Stock as Consideration in exchange for shares of  Company Common Stock
(except for cash received in lieu of a fractional  share of Acquiror Common
Stock). Such opinion may note that "5%  shareholders" will qualify for such
nonrecognition treatment only if  they enter into a "gain recognition
agreement" under regulations  promulgated   -43-    under Section 367 of
the Code. In rendering such opinion, counsel may  require and rely upon (and
may incorporate by reference) certain  representations of the Acquiror and

counsel to the  Acquiror, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that, for
federal  income tax purposes, the Merger constitutes a "reorganization"
within  the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. In rendering such opinion, 
counsel may require and rely upon (and may incorporate by reference)  certain
representations of the Acquiror and the Company reasonably  requested by such
counsel.    ARTICLE VIII   Termination   8.01 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned:   (a) MUTUAL
CONSENT. At any time prior to the Effective Time,  by the mutual consent of
the Acquiror and the Company, if the Board of  Directors of each so
determines by vote of a majority of the members of  its entire Board.  
-44-    (b) BREACH. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the 
Acquiror or the Company, in each case if its Board of Directors so 
determines by vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in  the
event of either: (1) a breach by the other party of any  representation or
warranty contained herein, which breach cannot be or  has not been cured
within 30 days after the giving of written notice to  the breaching party of
such breach; or (2) a breach by the other party  of any of the covenants or
agreements contained herein, which breach  cannot be or has not been cured
within 30 days after the giving of  written notice to the breaching party of
such breach and which breach,  individually or in the aggregate with other
such breaches, would cause  the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or
(b), in the case of a  breach or breaches by the Company, or Section 7.02(a)
or (b), in the  case of a breach or breaches by the Acquiror, not to be
satisfied or  would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially  impair the ability of the Company or the Acquiror to consummate
the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(c) DELAY. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the  Acquiror or the
Company, in each case if its Board of Directors so  determines by vote of a
majority of the members of its entire Board, in  the event that the Merger is
not consummated by November 30, 2001,  except to the extent that the failure
of the Merger then to be  consummated arises out of or results from the
action or inaction of the  party seeking to terminate pursuant to this
Section 8.01(c).   (d) NO APPROVAL. By the Company or the Acquiror, in each
case  if its Board of Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of
the  members of its entire Board, in the event the approval of any 
Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the  other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been  denied by final
nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority.   (e) FAILURE TO
RECOMMEND, Etc. (1) By the Acquiror, if (i) at  any time prior to the receipt
of the approval of the Company\'s  shareholders contemplated by Section
7.01(a), the Company Board shall  not recommend that the shareholders give
such approval, or (ii) the  Company Board takes any of the actions described
in clause (ii) or  (iii) of the proviso to Section 6.06.   (2) By the
Company if, having acted in accordance  with Sections 6.02, 6.06 and 8.03 and
the Company\'s other obligations  hereunder, (i) the Company Board shall have
determined that an  Acquisition Proposal from a third party constitutes a
Superior Proposal  and authorized and directed the Company to execute a
definitive  agreement with such third party to effect such Superior Proposal
and  (ii) immediately upon termination the Company executes such
agreement.   (f) POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT. By the Company, if the Company Board 
so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of the entire 
Company   -45-    Board, at any time during the five-day period
commencing with the  Determination Date, if both of the following conditions
are satisfied:   (i) The Average Closing Price on the Determination  Date
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be less than the  product of 0.80
and the Starting Price; and   (ii) (A) The number obtained by dividing the
Average  Closing Price on the Determination Date by the Starting Price 
(such number, the "Acquiror Ratio") shall be less than (B) the  number
obtained by dividing the Index Price on the  Determination Date by the Index
Price on the Starting Date and  subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in this
Section 8(f)(ii)(B)  (such number, the "Index Ratio");   subject, however,
to the following four sentences. If the Company  elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant to this Section  8.01(f), it shall give prompt
written notice to the Acquiror; provided  that such notice of election may be
withdrawn at any time within the  aforementioned five-day period. During the
five-day period commencing  with its receipt of such notice, the Acquiror
shall have the option of  adjusting the Exchange Ratio to the lesser of (i) a
number equal to a  quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the
numerator of  which is the product of 0.80, the Starting Price and the
Exchange Ratio  (as then in effect) and the denominator of which is the
Average Closing  Price, and (ii) a number equal to a quotient (rounded to the
nearest  one-thousandth), the numerator of which is the Index Ratio
multiplied  by the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator of
which  is the Acquiror Ratio. If the Acquiror determines so to increase the 
Exchange Ratio within such five-day period, it shall give prompt  written
notice to the Company of its determination and the revised  Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall occur pursuant to this  Section 8.01(f) and
this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance  with its terms (except
as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so  modified), and any references in
this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio"  shall thereafter be deemed to refer
to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted  pursuant to this Section 8.01(f).   8.02
Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the event of termination of this
Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, no
party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to any
other party hereunder except (a) as set forth in Sections 8.03 and 9.01 and
(b) that termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for
any willful breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination.  
8.03 Termination Fee. (a) In addition to any other rights that the Acquiror
has under this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement and/or otherwise, if
this Agreement is terminated by the Acquiror pursuant to (1) Section 8.01(b)
with respect to a breach of Section 6.01, 6.02 or 6.06 on the part of the
Company, or any knowing, or willful or intentional, breach on the part of the
Company (at a time when   -46-   an Initial Triggering Event (as defined
in the Stock Option Agreement) has occurred and the Company is unable to
terminate pursuant to such Section 8.01(b)) or (2) Section 8.01(e)(1) or
8.01(e)(2), then the Company shall pay to the Acquiror U.S. $100,000,000 (it
being understood that such fee is not intended as liquidated damages). In
addition to any other rights that either party has under this Agreement, the
Stock Option Agreement and/or otherwise, solely for the purpose of
reimbursing an amount of certain out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with negotiations and investigations undertaken with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and not as liquidated damages, if this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b): (x) by the Company (at a
time when the Acquiror is unable to terminate pursuant to Section 8.01(b)),
then the Acquiror shall pay to the Company U.S. $20,000,000 and (y) by the
Acquiror (other than with respect to a breach for which a fee is payable
under the preceding sentence, at a time when the Company is unable
to terminate pursuant to Section 8.01(b)), then the Company shall pay to
the Acquiror U.S. $20,000,000.   (b) Any payment required to be made under
Section 8.03(a) shall be payable, without setoff, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, to an account specified by the Acquiror, within
three business days following such termination.   (c) The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are
cumulative with, and not intended to limit, other remedies that may be
available, and that, without these agreements, the Acquiror would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Acquiror commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the payment set forth in this Section 8.03, the
Company shall pay the Acquiror\'s costs and expenses (including attorneys\'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.03 from the date such amount becomes payable until
the date of such payment at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made plus two (2) percent.    ARTICLE

agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement (1) other than those

prior to the Effective Time, or (2) other than those contained in Sections
6.12 and in this Article IX, shall survive the Effective Time.   9.02

Agreement may be (a) waived by the party benefitted by the provision, or  
-47-   (b) amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing
