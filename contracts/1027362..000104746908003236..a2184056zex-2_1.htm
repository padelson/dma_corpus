Section&nbsp;7.1(g), (ii)&nbsp;pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1(h), or (iii)&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.1(d) or 7.1(i), (B)&nbsp;prior to such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company was publicly disclosed, and (C)&nbsp;within 12&nbsp;months following the termination of this Agreement, either any Acquisition with respect to the Company is
consummated or the Company enters into a Contract providing for any Acquisition, then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $7,936,884 (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Termination Fee</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") in immediately available funds promptly but in no event later than: one Business Day after the date of such termination, if
terminated pursuant to clause&nbsp;(i) above; concurrent with such termination if terminated pursuant to clause&nbsp;(ii) above; or the earlier of the date of the Company's entry into such
Contract providing for an Acquisition or the consummation of such Acquisition, if terminated pursuant to clause&nbsp;(iii) above. </FONT></P>

Company shall reimburse Parent for all of Parent's reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses not in excess of $2,000,000 in connection with the evaluation and pursuit of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent. The amount of any fees and expenses reimbursed by the Company to Parent shall be credited against any
subsequent payment by the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.3(b). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the amount of, and the basis for payment of, the reasonable fees and expenses described therein is reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and (iii)&nbsp;without this

order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in Sections&nbsp;7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in Sections&nbsp;7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c) at the prime rate
of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. All payments under this Section&nbsp;7.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent. </FONT></P>

direct or indirect parent thereto, (ii)&nbsp;a sale or other disposition by the Company or its Subsidiaries of assets (in a transaction or series of transactions) representing in excess of 40% of
the aggregate fair market value of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such sale, or (iii)&nbsp;the acquisition by any Person or Group (including by way of a tender
offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. </FONT></P>
