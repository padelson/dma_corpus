 1.6 _ Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws._ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by the CGCL and such Articles of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that Article I of the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended as of the Effective Time to read: "The name of the corporation is Synplicity, Inc."

 (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Common Stock: 

    

 (i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall automatically be cancelled and no longer deemed outstanding, and the holders thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest, upon surrender of Certificates in accordance with Section 1.10. The amount of cash each such holder is entitled to receive for the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder. 

  

 (ii) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of Parent, be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the shares of Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation\'s capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Sub common stock will evidence ownership of such shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

    

   

   

           

  

  

 (b) _ Cancellation of Company Common Stock Owned by the Company and Parent._ At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (c) _ Adjustments._ In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination, recapitalization or other like changes. 

  

 (d) _ Dissenters\' Rights._ Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Per-Share Cash Amount provided for in Section 1.8(a), but instead shall be converted into the right to receive only such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the CGCL. At the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished. Notwithstanding Section 1.8(a), in the event any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to require the Company to so purchase the Dissenting Shares, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Per-Share Cash Amount as provided in Section 1.8(a), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands delivered pursuant to the CGCL, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and received by the Company relating to a shareholder\'s demand that the Company purchase shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) the right to direct all Proceedings with respect to such demands under the CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. 

  

  

 1.9 _ Effect on Company Options; and Company RSUs._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Company Options_ 

    

 (i) Except as described below in Sections 1.9(a)(ii), (iii) and (iv), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed and converted by Parent or treated otherwise in accordance with Section 5.12. 

  

 (ii) Each Company Option granted under the Company 1995 Stock Option Plan that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that has an exercise price per share that is less than the Per-Share Cash Amount (the "1995 Cash-Out Options") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per-Share Cash Amount over the per share exercise price of such 1995 Cash-Out Option (the "1995 Plan 

   

      

   
  

Option Consideration"). The payment of the 1995 Plan Option Consideration
shall be subject to withholdings for all applicable Taxes. The amount of cash
each holder of 1995 Cash-Out Options is entitled to receive for the 1995
Cash-Out Options held by such holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and
computed after aggregating cash amounts for all 1995 Cash-Out Options held by
such holder. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Parent shall pay,
or shall cause the Paying Agent to pay each holder of 1995 Cash-Out Options
the cash (less any applicable Taxes required to be deducted and withheld)
required to be paid to such holder pursuant to this Section 1.9(a)(ii). Each
Company Option granted under the 1995 Stock Option Plan that is unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and has an
exercise price per share that is greater than the Per-Share Cash Amount (the
"1995 Out-of-the-Money Options" and together with the 1995 Cash-Out Options,
the "1995 Plan Options") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the need
for any further action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and extinguished.

  

 (iii) No Company Option granted under the Company\'s 2000 Director Option Plan (the "Director Options") shall be assumed by Parent and each such Director Option that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, other than the Company delivering notices required pursuant to the 2000 Director Option Plan and the holder thereof acknowledging such treatment, be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per-Share Cash Amount over the per share exercise price of such Director Option (the "Director Option Consideration"). The payment of the Director Option Consideration shall be subject to withholdings for all applicable Taxes. The amount of cash each holder of Director Options is entitled to receive for the Director Options held by such holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Director Options held by such holder. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Paying Agent to pay each holder of Director Options the cash (less any applicable Taxes required to be deducted and withheld) required to be paid to such holder pursuant to this Section 1.9(a)(iii). 

  

 (iv) No Company Option granted outside the Company\'s 1995 Stock Option Plan, 2000 Stock Option Plan and 2000 Director Option Plan (the "Non-Plan Options") shall be assumed by Parent and each such Non-Plan Option that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without the need for any further action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per-Share Cash Amount over the per share exercise price of such Non-Plan Option (the "Non-Plan Option Consideration"). The payment of the Non-Plan Option Consideration shall be subject to withholdings for all applicable Taxes. The amount of cash each holder of Non-Plan Options is entitled to receive for the Non-Plan Options held by such holder shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Non-Plan Options held by such holder. As soon as practicable following the Closing, Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Paying Agent to pay each holder of Non-Plan Options the cash (less any applicable Taxes required to be deducted and withheld) required to be paid to such holder pursuant to this Section 1.9(a)(iv). 

    

 (b) _ Company RSUs._ At the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time 

  

      

  

shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, be assumed and converted by Parent or treated otherwise in
accordance with Section 5.12.

  

  

 1.10 _ Surrender of Certificates._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint U.S. Bank N.A. or such other agent or agents as may be agreed by the parties and appointed by Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to act as paying agent under this Agreement in connection with the Merger for the purpose of distributing the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) (other than shares subject to Section 1.9(a)) upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.10. 

  

 (b) _ Parent to Deposit Cash._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in event within three (3) Business Days thereof), Parent, or a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, shall make available to the Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through the procedures described below, the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a). 

   

 (c) _ Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereof), Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates evidencing the Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Certificates"), (i) a letter of transmittal (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use of such letter of transmittal in effecting surrender of Certificates in exchange for the cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent (or receipt of an "agent\'s message" by the Paying Agent (or any other evidence of transfer that the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of the transfer of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, each holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.8(a). 

  

 (d) _ No Interest._ No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a), 1.8(d) or 1.9. 

  

 (e) _ Transfers of Ownership._ If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (f) _ No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.10, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. 

  

 (g) _ Unclaimed Cash._ Any portion of funds held by the Paying Agent which have not been delivered to any holders of Certificates pursuant to this Article I within twelve months after the Effective Time shall promptly be paid to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate who 

  

      

  
  

has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by Section 1.10(c) shall look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar Legal Requirements) for its claim,
only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash payable to such
holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the
date on which the merger consideration contemplated by Section 1.8(a) in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

 1.11 _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid or payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be so paid or payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificate shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

  

 1.12 _ Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue and pay in exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be required pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate; provided, however, that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent and/or any of their respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 1.13 _ Withholding Rights._ The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement, shares deliverable upon exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any Certificates, such amounts as the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code, any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Tax law, or pursuant to other applicable Judgments. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 1.14 _ Tax Consequences._ Parent makes no representations or warranties to the Company or to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company RSUs or Company Options regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any Tax consequences to the Company or any such holder of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions or agreements contemplated hereby. The Company acknowledges that the Company and such holders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions and agreements contemplated hereby. 

   

 1.15 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts.

of restricting the Company from fulfilling its obligations under this
Agreement and (D) prior to or contemporaneously with delivering or making
available any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company shall

information has not been previously delivered by the Company to Parent).

 (vi) the Company Board has concluded in its good faith, reasonable judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer (respecting which the Company has been provided a Section 5.3(d) Notice), that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements. 

    

In addition, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this
Section 5.3, at any time prior to the time the Company Shareholder Approval
has been obtained, the Company Board may, in response to a material
development or change in material circumstances occurring or arising after the
Agreement Date, the existence and material consequences of which were neither
known nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board at or prior to the
Agreement Date (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material
development or change in circumstances, an "Intervening Event"), make a
Change of Recommendation if the Company Board has in good faith determined,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect such a Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; provided that, the Company Board shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a Change of Recommendation pursuant to
this sentence unless the Company has (x) provided to Parent at least three
Business Days\' prior written notice (unless the Intervening Event arises
fewer than three Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting in
which case such notice shall be given as promptly as practicable) advising
Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (y) during such three Business Day
period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for a Change
of Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event.

  

 (e) _ Compliance with Tender Offer Rules._ Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however,_ that the Company shall not effect, or disclose pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position which constitutes, a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted by the terms of Section 5.3(d). 

  

  

 5.4 _ Access to Information._ 

  

  

 (a) During the period commencing on the Agreement Date and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 or the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford Parent and its accountants, investment bankers, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during business hours to (A) all of the properties, books, Contracts and records (including but not limited to information regarding the Company\'s capitalization (including Company options and Company RSUs) and access to the Company\'s transfer agent) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (B) all other

been a party, (D) receipts for any Taxes paid to foreign Tax Authorities and
(E) the Company\'s proxy solicitors in connection with obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval (including customary updates regarding the status of the
vote), _provided_ , _however_ , that Company may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that any Legal Requirement applicable to Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or the maintenance of any attorney-client privilege
requires that such party restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that with respect to any documents or
other information subject to the attorney-client privilege, the Company shall
reasonably cooperate with Parent to develop procedures (such as a common
legal interest agreement) to allow such documents and information to be shared
with Parent and its advisors without waiving such attorney-client privilege.

  

 (b) Promptly upon request by Parent, the Company shall provide to Parent all of the information with respect to Company Options and Company RSUs, in the form maintained by Equity Edge, that is customarily and reasonably required to enable Parent to transfer such information to Parent\'s database.

 5.7 _ Reasonable Best Efforts._ Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.6(d), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, and to cooperate with each other party hereto, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (a) taking all reasonable actions necessary to satisfy the respective conditions set forth in Article VI, and (b) executing and delivering such other instruments and doing and performing such other acts and things as may be necessary or reasonably desirable to effect completely the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 5.8 _ Third Party Consents; Notices._ 

  

  

 (a) Promptly following the Agreement Date, the Company and Parent shall cooperate to create a reasonable plan for obtaining prior to the Closing, all material consents, waivers and approvals under each Contract listed or described on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_ (and any Contract entered into after the Agreement Date that would have been required to be listed or described on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_ if entered into prior to the Agreement Date), using forms reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company.

 5.9 _ Notice of Certain Matters._ During the period commencing on the Agreement Date and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 or the Effective Time, the Company will notify Parent in writing promptly after learning of: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; (iii) any Proceeding by or before any court, Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or known by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be threatened against Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or shareholders in their capacity as such, or of any verbal or written correspondence from any Person asserting or implying a material claim against the Company or with respect to any of its material assets or properties (including Intellectual Property); (iv) any change, occurrence or event not in the ordinary course of business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (v) any Material Adverse Effect on the Company; or (vi) any material claim or any written inquiry by any Tax Authority, regarding Taxes payable by the Company.

the general status of the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. During the period commencing on the Agreement Date and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1 or the Effective Time, the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of any representation or warranty made by it contained
in this Agreement becoming materially untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of
the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties herein or affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise
limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the parties hereto. The
failure of the Company to provide notice as set forth in this Section 5.9
shall not be deemed a material breach of the Company\'s obligations pursuant
to Section 6.3(b) if the underlying matter would not give rise to the
Company\'s inability to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 or
6.3.

  

 5.10 _ Company Employee Plans Other than 401(k) Plan and the Nonqualified Plan._ The Company shall cooperate with Parent and assist Parent in its efforts to obtain written consents, waivers or other agreements from the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' employees with respect to the amendment or termination of Company Employee Plans, or the adoption of new arrangements with such employees, prior to the Closing. 

  

 5.11 _ Termination of 401(k) Plan and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan._ Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the 401(k) Plan (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than three business days prior to the Closing Date that such 401(k) Plan shall not be terminated). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than three business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) Plan has been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company\'s Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent\'s counsel. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require. In the event that termination of the 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Company shall terminate any and all plans intended to constitute a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, including, without limitation, the Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan (the " _Nonqualified Plan_ "), unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing that the Nonqualified Plan shall not be terminated. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, no later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Nonqualified Plan has been terminated (effective as of the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent\'s counsel. 

  

 5.12 _ Assumption of Company Options and Company RSUs and Certain Other Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option (other than 1995 Plan Options (except, and for the sake of clarity, to the extent such Company Options issued under the 1995 Stock Option Plan have an exercise price equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount, which Company Options are being assumed pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.12(a)), Director Options and Non-Plan Options) that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Parent. Each such Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth in the Company 

  

      

  

Option Plan that such Company Option was granted under and the applicable
stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) such Company Option shall be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded
down to the next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash
being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Option
Exchange Ratio, (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall be
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the next whole cent) obtained by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Option Exchange Ratio, (iii) no assumed Company Option may be "early
exercised" ( _i.e._ , an assumed Company Option may be exercised for shares of
Parent Common Stock only to the extent such assumed Company Option is vested
at the time of exercise pursuant to the applicable vesting schedule), and (iv)
Parent\'s board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the
authority of the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the
Company Options and Company Option Plans. It is the intent of the parties that
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all assumed Company
Options in respect of Company Options that prior to the Effective Time were
treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options under the Code shall from
and after the Effective Time continue to be treated as incentive or non-
qualified stock options, respectively, under the Code. The Merger shall
not terminate any of the outstanding Company Options under the Company Option
Plans or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such Company Options or
the shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be subject to those Company
Options upon Parent\'s assumption of such Company Options in the Merger.
Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each Person who
immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding
Company Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company
Option by Parent.

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Parent. Each such Company RSU so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Option Plan that such Company RSU was granted under and the applicable stock unit agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that such Company RSU shall represent that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that represented such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio. Consistent with the terms of the applicable Company Option Plan and the documents governing the outstanding Company RSUs under such plan as in effect on the date hereof, the Merger shall not terminate any of the outstanding Company RSUs under such plan or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of such Company RSUs or the shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be subject to those Company RSUs upon Parent\'s assumption of such Company RSUs in the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding Company RSU a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company RSU by Parent. 

  

 (c) On or about the date which is ten (10) Business Days prior to the expected date on which the Closing is to occur, the Company shall, as and to the extent necessary, deliver to Parent a revised _Schedule 2.13(l)_ which sets forth each Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as of the date such revised _Schedule 2.13(l)_ is delivered to Parent. 

  

      

           

  

  

 (d) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Company Options and settlement of Company RSUs and assumed by Parent for which a Form S-8 registration statement is available as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within seven Business Days (assuming timely receipt of all option documentation relating to the assumed Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time necessary for such filing, all restricted stock unit documentation relating to the assumed Company RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time necessary for such filing and all signatures, opinions, and consents required for such registration statement), after the Closing. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such assumed Company Options and assumed Company RSUs remain outstanding and will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or settlement thereof. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with and assist Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. 

   

 (e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the termination of the Company ESPP upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (and subject to the consummation of the Merger) or (ii) the date upon which the Company ESPP terminates by its terms. To the extent permitted by the Company ESPP, the rights of participants in the Company ESPP with respect to any outstanding offering period under the Company ESPP shall be determined by treating the Business Day prior to the Effective Time (such date, the "Designated Date") as the last day of such outstanding offering period and by making pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP. On the Designated Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within each participant\'s payroll withholding account to the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP unless such participant has previously withdrawn from such offering period in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. 

  

 (f) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits (including vacation accrual and for the avoidance of doubt excluding vesting under any applicable equity incentive plan of Parent) under any Parent employee welfare benefit plan, Parent shall provide employees who continue in the employ of Parent (or a subsidiary of Parent) following the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") with service credit for their period of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and predecessors prior to the Closing Date, except where doing so would provide duplication of benefits and provided further where the terms of such employee welfare benefit plan provides for such service credit. Parent, to the extent required by applicable law and as permitted by the terms of the applicable group health plans, will cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which such employees and their eligible dependents will participate to be waived. To the extent permitted by the applicable group health plans, Parent shall also provide Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents with credit for any copayments and deductibles made under any Company Employee Plans for the year in which the Closing occurs under comparable medical, dental and vision plans of Parent for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under such Parent benefit plan in the year in which the Closing occurs. 

  

  

 5.13 _ Indemnification._ 

  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to its current and former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the 

  

      

  

Company after the Agreement Date but prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
the Company and such Indemnified Parties existing as of the Agreement Date
and pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Company\'s Articles
of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the Agreement Date, in each case,

 (c) Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a six year "tail" insurance policy for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the Effective Time in substitution of, and of comparable coverage to, the existing policy of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company as of the Agreement Date in the form made available by the Company to Parent prior to the Agreement Date (the "Existing DandO Policy") for a cost not to exceed $500,000. In the event that the premium for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds $500,000, Parent or Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the Effective Time the Existing DandO Policy, provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy in excess of an amount equal to 200% of the most recently paid annual premium for the Existing DandO Policy (the "Maximum Premium"); provided, further, that in the event any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policy exceed the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

  

 (d) This Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties subject to the occurrence of the Closing, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified Party (provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal prior the Effective Time shall be governed by Section 8.1). 

  

  

 5.14 _ Section 16 Matters._ Provided that the Company delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information in a timely fashion, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any disposition of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I of this Agreement by each Company Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

expected to be converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock, in
connection with the Merger. "Company Insiders" shall mean those individuals
who are subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company.

  

 5.15 _ Takeover Statutes._ The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all actions reasonably necessary to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if any takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Company Board and the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) of Parent; 

   

 (b) by either Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 20, 2008 or any other date that Parent and the Company may agree upon in writing (the "Initial End Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Initial End Date, but on such date, all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI (other than conditions that by their nature are only to be satisfied as of the Closing and the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1(b), 6.1(c), 6.1(d) and 6.3(c)) have been satisfied or waived in writing, then neither party shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) until November 20, 2008 (the "Extended End Date") and, _provided_ , _further_ , in any event, a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if the failure to consummate the Merger by the Initial End Date or the Extended End Date, as the case may be, is principally caused by the breach by such party of this Agreement;

 (f) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any 

  

      

  
  

representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) would not
be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue; _provided_ that if such
inaccuracy in the Company\'s representations and warranties or breach by the
Company is curable by the Company, then Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) for 60 calendar days after delivery of
written notice from Parent to the Company of such breach (it being understood
that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (f) if
such breach by the Company is cured during such 60 calendar day period);

  

 (g) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if a Triggering Event shall have occurred; 

  

 (h) by the Company, by written notice to Parent, upon a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Offer effected by the Company Board in compliance with Section 5.3(d) and concurrently with payment to Parent by the Company of all amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b) of this Agreement in accordance with the terms specified therein; provided, however, that immediately following such termination, the Company accepts and enters into a definitive written agreement delivered to the Company and executed on behalf of the Person making such Superior Offer reflecting such Superior Offer; or 

  

 (i) by Parent, by written notice to the Company, if the Company shall have breached in any material respect (or be deemed, pursuant to the terms thereof, to have breached in any material respects) the provisions of Sections 5.3(a). 

  

  

 For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Triggering Event" shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a Change of Recommendation for any reason; (ii) the Company shall have failed to convene or hold the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Section 5.2, (iii) the Company shall have failed to include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation; (iv) following any public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board fails to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days after Parent requests in writing that such recommendation be reaffirmed; (v) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have approved or publicly recommended any Acquisition Proposal; (vi) the Company shall have executed and delivered any Contract accepting any Acquisition Proposal; or (vii) the Company Board shall have failed within 10 Business Days after the date that any tender or exchange offer relating to Company Common Stock is commenced by any third Person that shall have been published, sent or given, to have sent to its security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, a statement disclosing that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer and reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation. 

  

 7.2 _ Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no Liability on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective officers, directors, shareholders or Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the provisions of Section 5.5(a) (Confidentiality), this Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 7.3 (Expenses and Termination Fees) and Article VIII (General Provisions) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from Liability in connection with any willful breach of any of such party\'s representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms. 

  

 7.3 _ Expenses and Termination Fees._ 

  

  

 (a) _ General._ Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

  

      

  

 (b) _ Company Payment._ In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(g), (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(h), or (iii) (A) pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or 7.1(i), (B) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company was publicly disclosed, and (C) within 12 months following the termination of this Agreement, either any Acquisition with respect to the Company is consummated or the Company enters into a Contract providing for any Acquisition, then, in any such case, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $7,936,884 (the "Termination Fee") in immediately available funds promptly but in no event later than: one Business Day after the date of such termination, if terminated pursuant to clause (i) above; concurrent with such termination if terminated pursuant to clause (ii) above; or the earlier of the date of the Company\'s entry into such Contract providing for an Acquisition or the consummation of such Acquisition, if terminated pursuant to clause (iii) above. 

  

 (c) In the event that either of Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d), within two Business Days following such termination, the Company shall reimburse Parent for all of Parent\'s reasonable fees and out of pocket expenses not in excess of $2,000,000 in connection with the evaluation and pursuit of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent.

Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the fees and expenses due pursuant to Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the amounts set forth in Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c), the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c) at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. All payments under this Section 7.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent. 

  

 (e) For the purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition" shall mean any of the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which the shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 60% of the aggregate equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct or indirect parent thereto, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the Company or its Subsidiaries of assets (in a transaction or series of transactions) representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market value of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any Person or Group (including by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

When a reference is made to a Schedule, such reference shall be to a Schedule to the Company Disclosure Letter. Where a reference is made to a Legal Requirement, such reference is to such Legal Requirement as amended. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of any gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; and (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement. 

  

 (c) The one percent (1.00%) threshold established by the parties with respect to the Company\'s capitalization in Section 6.3(a) hereof shall not, in and of itself, constitute an economic benchmark for determining whether any Effect shall be deemed to be material in relation to the Company and its business or shall be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

  

  

 8.6 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.7 _ Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest._ This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, and the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms, and (ii) are not intended to 

        
  

confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon any Person other than

rights of former holders of Company Common Stock to receive payments for
their respective Certificates in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of California, (B) the rights of holders of Company Options and
Company RSUs, after the Effective Time pursuant to Article I; and (C) as
otherwise expressly set forth in Section 5.13.

  

 8.8 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that Parent may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 

   

 8.9 _ Severability._ In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

   

 8.10 _ Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance._ Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 8.11 _ Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to such state\'s principles of conflicts of law; _provided_ , _however_ , that issues involving the fiduciary duties of the Company Board and consummation and effect of the Merger shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the Federal district court of the United States of America located within the City of Wilmington in the State of Delaware, in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such Proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such Proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such Proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.4 or in such other manner as may be permitted

thereof. With respect to any particular Proceeding, venue shall lie solely in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware.
