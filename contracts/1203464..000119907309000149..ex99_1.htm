(v)

    |

    |  

(ii)

    |

    |  

(iii)

    |  

that  the Orezone Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the  Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, is or would, if
completed,  reasonably be expected to constitute, a Superior  Proposal;

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

provided, however, that prior to taking any such action, Orezone must;

and containing terms no more favourable to such Person than the 
Confidentiality Agreement including a standstill  provision at least as
stringent as that contained in the Confidentiality  Agreement.

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

If Orezone, New Orezone or any of the Orezone Subsidiaries receives a request
for material non-public information from a Person who has made an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal and Orezone is permitted, as
contemplated under this subsection 4.2(c), to consider and participate,
directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide
information to, or permit any visit to the properties or facilities of
Orezone, New Orezone or any of the Orezone Subsidiaries, subject to the
execution by such Person of the confidentiality agreement as described above,
provide such Person with such information and access; provided that Orezone
sends a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to IAMGOLD promptly upon
its execution and IAMGOLD is provided with a list of, and a copy of, the
information provided to such Person (if not previously provided with such
information) and is immediately provided with access to similar information
to which such Person is provided (if not previously provided with such
access).

 

 

       

 

    |  

(d)

    |  

From  and after the date of this Agreement, Orezone shall promptly (and in
any  event within 24 hours) notify IAMGOLD, at first orally and then in 
writing, of any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to or constituting an 
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating  to
Orezone, New Orezone or any of the Orezone  Subsidiaries. Such notice shall
include a description of the  terms and conditions of any such proposal,
inquiry or offer, the identity  of the Person making such proposal, inquiry
or offer and provide such  other details of the proposal, inquiry or offer as
IAMGOLD may reasonably  request. Orezone shall keep IAMGOLD fully informed on

any  such inquiry, proposal or offer.

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(e)

    |  

Nothing  contained in subsection 4.2(b) above shall prohibit the Orezone
Board from  taking any action prohibited by subsection 4.2(b)(iii), if the
Orezone  Board determines, in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal  counsel) that such action or inaction is necessary for the Orezone
Board  to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties or
Applicable  Laws, provided that Orezone may not proceed with the announcement
of such  decision before giving written notice of such decision to  IAMGOLD.
The foregoing shall not relieve Orezone from its  obligation to proceed to
call and hold the Orezone Meeting and to hold a  vote of the Orezone
Shareholders on the Arrangement Resolution, except in  circumstances where
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the  terms hereof prior to
the date of the Orezone  Meeting.

    |  

(f)

    |  

Orezone  and New Orezone shall ensure that each of its respective officers
and  directors and the Orezone Subsidiaries and their respective officers
and  directors and all advisors and representatives retained by any of them

    | If Orezone, New Orezone and the Orezone  Subsidiaries have complied
with section 4.2 of this Agreement with respect  thereto, Orezone may accept,
approve, recommend or enter into any  agreement, understanding or arrangement
in respect of a Superior Proposal  prior to the approval of the Arrangement
Resolution by the Orezone  Shareholders and terminate this Agreement if, and
only if (with the  exception of a confidentiality agreement which complies
with section 4.2  hereof the execution of which shall not be subject to the
conditions of  this section 4.3):  
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

 

       

 

    |  

(i)

    |  

Orezone  has provided IAMGOLD with a copy of the document containing the
Superior  Proposal;

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(ii)

    |  

five  Business Days have elapsed from the later of (A) the date IAMGOLD
received  written notice (a "Superior Proposal  Notice") advising IAMGOLD
that the Orezone Board has resolved,  subject only to compliance with this
section 4.3, to accept, approve,  recommend or enter into an agreement in
respect of such Superior Proposal,  specifying the terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal and  identifying the Person making such Superior
Proposal, and (B) the date  IAMGOLD received a copy of the document
containing such Superior  Proposal;

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(iii)

    |  

the  Orezone Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with 
outside legal counsel) that it is necessary for the Orezone Board to take 
such action in order to discharge properly its fiduciary  duties;

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(iv)

    |  

such  Superior Proposal does not provide for the payment of any break, 
termination or other fee or expense to the Person making the Superior 
Proposal in the event that Orezone, New Orezone or any of the Orezone 
Subsidiaries completes the Arrangement and the other transactions 
contemplated in this Agreement or any other transaction with IAMGOLD or  any
of the IAMGOLD Subsidiaries agreed to prior to the termination of this 
Agreement,

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(v)

    |  

taking  into account any revised proposal made by IAMGOLD since receipt of
the  Superior Proposal Notice, such Superior Proposal remains a Superior 
Proposal and the Orezone Board has again made the determinations referred  to
in this subsection 4.3(a); and

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

       

 

    |  

(vi)

    |  

Orezone  has previously or concurrently paid or caused to be paid to IAMGOLD
the  Termination Fee payable under section 7.3 of this  Agreement.

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

In the event that Orezone provides IAMGOLD with a Superior Proposal Notice on
a date that is less than five Business Days prior to the Orezone Meeting,
Orezone shall adjourn the Orezone Meeting to a date that is not less than
five Business Days and not more than 10 Business Days after the date of
receipt by IAMGOLD of the Superior Proposal Notice.

 

 

       

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

During  the five Business Day period referred to in paragraph 4.3(a)(ii)
above,  IAMGOLD shall have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to
amend  the terms of this Agreement. The Orezone Board will review any 
proposal by IAMGOLD to amend  the terms of this Agreement in good faith in
order to determine whether  IAMGOLD's amended proposal upon acceptance by
Orezone would result in such  Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior
Proposal. If the  Orezone Board so determines, Orezone shall enter into an
amended agreement  with IAMGOLD reflecting IAMGOLD's amended proposal. If
the  Orezone Board continues to believe, in good faith and after
consultation  with the Financial Advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Superior  Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects
IAMGOLD's  amended proposal, Orezone may, on termination of this Agreement
in  accordance with section 7.1 hereof and payment of the Termination Fee
as  required pursuant to section 7.3 hereof, accept, approve, recommend or 
enter into an agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of such 
Superior Proposal.

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(c)

    |  

Orezone  and New Orezone hereby acknowledge and agree that each successive
material  modification of any Acquisition Proposal shall constitute a new 
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of section 4.2 hereof and the  requirement
under paragraph 4.3(a)(ii) hereof to initiate an additional  five Business
Day notice period.

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(d)

    |  

If  the Orezone Information Circular has been sent to the Orezone
Shareholders  prior to the expiry of the five Business Day period set forth
in  subsection 4.3(a) hereof and, during such period, IAMGOLD requests in 
writing that the Orezone Meeting proceed, unless otherwise ordered by the 
Court, Orezone shall continue to take all reasonable actions necessary to 
hold the Orezone Meeting and to cause the Arrangement to be voted on at  the
Orezone Meeting.

    |  

(b)

    |

    |  

(c)

    |  

either  Orezone or IAMGOLD shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
subsection  7.1(e) hereof in circumstances where the Arrangement Resolution
has not  received the required Orezone Shareholders Approval at the Orezone
Meeting  and (i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced
or  made by any Person other than IAMGOLD prior to the Orezone Meeting and
not  publicly withdrawn more than  five Business Days prior to the Orezone

available funds to an account designated by IAMGOLD. In the circumstances set
forth in subsection 7.3(a), (b), (d) or (e) above, the Termination Fee shall
be payable at the time of termination and, in the circumstances set forth in
subsection 7.3(c) above, the Termination Fee shall be payable within three
Business Days following the earlier of the date on which Orezone enters into
an agreement in respect of an Acquisition Proposal or the date on which
Orezone consummates an Acquisition Proposal. Orezone shall not be obligated
to make more than one payment pursuant to this section 7.3. Orezone hereby
acknowledges that the payment amount set out in this section 7.3 is a payment
of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which
IAMGOLD will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such
damages and the resultant non-completion of the Arrangement and is not
a penalty. Orezone hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise
as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.

Following  the Effective Date, New Orezone and IAMGOLD shall have the right
without  consulting or notifying the other to engage in and receive full
benefits  from other and independent business activities, whether or not
competitive  or in conflict with the transactions contemplated in this 
Agreement. The doctrine of "corporate opportunity" or "business  opportunity"
shall not be applied to any other transaction, activity,  venture or
operation of New Orezone or IAMGOLD not within the boundaries  or in respect
of the Essakane Property and, except as otherwise expressly  provided in
other agreements between New Orezone and IAMGOLD, if any,  neither of New
Orezone or IAMGOLD shall have any duty to the other with  respect to any
opportunity to acquire property outside of the boundaries  of the Essakane
Property.

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

Agreements

 

 

       

8.2

    |  

Orezone,  New Orezone and certain Orezone Subsidiaries shall enter into an
agreement  with effect no later than the Effective Date pursuant to which
IAMGOLD,  directly or indirectly, will have the right to own and operate any
and all  deposits or mines located on any property to which the Kossa
Permit  relates that has been estimated to have gold revenue representing at
least  50% of the total revenue from such deposit or mine, with such
agreement to  be in form and substance acceptable to IAMGOLD (the "Kossa Gold

Post-Closing Adjustments

 

 

       

8.3

    |  

For  a period of two years following the Effective Date, to the extent that 
IAMGOLD and New Orezone determine, after the Effective Date, that the 
occurrence of any circumstance or event which requires a post-closing 
adjustment by the Parties hereto, the Parties hereto will work together to 
determine a mutually acceptable tax-efficient manner to effect, to the 
greatest extent possible, the necessary transfers and will, in any event, 
effect the necessary transfers and make any payments or reimbursements 
related thereon, as the case may be within 15 calendar days after the 
determination of any such adjustments by cheque or wire transfer to the 
Party hereto to whom such payments or reimbursements are payable or  owed.

Indemnification by New Orezone

 

 

       

8.4

    |  

From  the Effective Time, New Orezone hereby agrees to indemnify and save 
harmless IAMGOLD, Orezone and the Orezone Subsidiaries from all Losses 
suffered or incurred by IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries as a 
result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection  with:

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

 

       

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

Indemnified  Liability; or

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

any  Indemnified Taxes.

    
---|---|--- 
   

 

 

       

 

    |  

If  any claim, proceeding or other matter resulting from the occurrence of
any  of the events contemplated by subsection 8.4(a) or (b) above (a "Claim")
is made against  IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries by a third
party for which  IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries may be entitled
to  indemnification, IAMGOLD or Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries, as 
applicable, shall give notice (the "Indemnity Notice") to  New Orezone
specifying the particulars of such Claim within 60 days after  it receives
notification of the Claim. New Orezone shall have the right to  participate
in any negotiations or proceedings with respect to such  Claim. IAMGOLD,
Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries, as  applicable shall not settle or
compromise any such Claim without the prior  written consent of New Orezone,
unless New Orezone has not, within five  Business Days after the giving of
the Indemnity Notice, given notice to  IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone
Subsidiaries, as applicable, that it  wishes to dispute such Claim. If New
Orezone does give such a  notice, it shall have the right to assume the
defence of such Claim and to  defend such Claim in the name of IAMGOLD,
Orezone or the Orezone  Subsidiaries, as applicable. IAMGOLD, Orezone and the
Orezone  Subsidiaries shall provide to New Orezone all files, books, records
and  other information in its possession or control which may be relevant
to  the defence of such Claim. IAMGOLD and Orezone shall co-operate  in all
reasonable respects in the defence of such Claim. If New  Orezone fails after
the giving of such notice, diligently and reasonably  to defend such Claim
throughout the period that such Claim exists, its  right to defend the Claim
shall terminate and IAMGOLD, Orezone or the  Orezone Subsidiaries may assume
the defence of such Claim. In  such event, IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone
Subsidiaries may compromise or  settle such Claim without the consent of New
Orezone.

 

 

 

In  the event that a Claim relates to Indemnified Taxes where a
Governmental  Entity has asserted that Taxes are payable in respect of the
Orezone Inc.  Transfer or the settlement of the OEL Debt as described under
section 4.6  hereof, Orezone and the Orezone Subsidiaries will use all tax
deductions  and tax credits available immediately before the Effective Date
to reduce  any possible additional Taxes related to such Claim. In the 
event described in the preceding sentence, Orezone and the Orezone 
Subsidiaries will require indemnification from New Orezone only where the 
balance of the tax deductions or taxes credits that were available 
immediately before the Effective Date would not be sufficient to result in 
no Taxes being payable in connection with such Claim.

 

 

In  the event that the Claim relates to Indemnified Taxes, New Orezone
shall  pay to IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries, as the case may
be,  an amount equal to the amount of Indemnified Taxes upon the amount of 
Indemnified Taxes being finally determined whether by assessment, 
reassessment or agreement with the Governmental Entity or by judicial 
determination. If IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries  shall receive
a refund of any Indemnified Taxes in respect of which a  payment has been
made pursuant to this section 8.4 the amount of such  refund shall forthwith
be paid to New Orezone, together with interest, if  any, paid by the
applicable Governmental Entity on such refund (net of any  taxes thereon).

 

    
---|--- 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

If the amount of Indemnified Taxes imposed on or suffered by IAMGOLD, Orezone
or the Orezone Subsidiaries as finally determined, is greater than the amount
which was paid by New Orezone to IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries
or to any Governmental Entity on account of Indemnified Taxes, New Orezone
shall, forthwith following such final determination, pay the amount of such
difference to IAMGOLD, Orezone or the Orezone Subsidiaries together with any
interest which may be payable to a Governmental Entity in respect of such
amount.

 

 

Remedies

 

 

       

8.5

    |  

The  Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an award of money damages may
be  inadequate for any breach of this Agreement by any Party hereto or its 
representatives and advisors and that such breach may cause the  non-
breaching Party hereto irreparable harm. Accordingly, the  Parties hereto
agree that, in the event of any such breach or threatened  breach of this
Agreement by one of the Parties hereto, IAMGOLD (if either  Orezone or New
Orezone is the breaching Party) or Orezone and New Orezone  (if IAMGOLD is
the breaching Party) will be entitled, without the  requirement of posting a
bond or other security, to seek equitable relief,  including injunctive
relief and specific performance. Subject  to any other provision hereof
including, without limitation, section 7.3  hereof, such remedies will not be
the exclusive remedies for any breach of  this Agreement but will be in
addition to all other remedies available  hereunder or at law or in equity to
each of the Parties  hereto.

When authorizing such delivery of certificates  representing the IAMGOLD

to receive in exchange for such lost,  stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Orezone Shareholder to whom  certificates representing such IAMGOLD Shares
and New Orezone Shares are  to be delivered shall, as a condition precedent
to the delivery of such  IAMGOLD Shares and New Orezone Shares, give a bond
satisfactory to  IAMGOLD, New Orezone and the Depositary in such amount as
IAMGOLD, New  Orezone and the Depositary may direct, or otherwise indemnify
IAMGOLD, New  Orezone and the Depositary in a manner satisfactory to IAMGOLD,
New  Orezone and the Depositary, against any claim that may be made against 
IAMGOLD, New Orezone or the Depositary with respect to the certificate 
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed and shall otherwise take  such

of  this section 5. Subject to Applicable Law and to section 5  hereof, at
the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition to the  delivery of a
certificate representing the IAMGOLD Shares and the New  Orezone Shares to
which such holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to  such holder, without

and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the  United
States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any provision of any  applicable
federal, provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each  case, as

shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been  paid to the Orezone
Shareholder in respect of which such deduction and  withholding was made,
provided that such withheld amounts are actually  remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority.
