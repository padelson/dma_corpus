Official acknowledges that his skills are such that he can be gainfully employed in non-competitive employment, and that the agreement not to compete will in no way prevent him from earning a living. If any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by the court making such determination so as to
be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified, to be fully enforced. By agreeing to this contractual modification prospectively at this time, the parties intend to make this provision enforceable under the laws of Mississippi in the Restricted

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>6.7 Remedies.</B>&nbsp;In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;6, Executive agrees that the Bank shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith, whether in a court of law or by means of arbitration,
in the Bank&#146;s discretion. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Bank from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach, whether in law or equity, including the recovery of damages from
Executive. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Executive further agrees that upon the issuance of a temporary restraining order, the Bank may, in its discretion, suspend any payments or
benefits due to Executive or his dependents under this Agreement; <U>provided that</U> such payments shall be resumed when the Bank reasonably determines that such breach or threatened breach has been corrected or cured, to the extent that such
breach is susceptible of correction or cure. The Bank shall provide to Executive written notice of the events giving rise to Executive&#146;s breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement, including a statement as to whether the
Bank reasonably believes that such breach or threatened breach is susceptible of cure, at least two business days before seeking a temporary restraining order hereunder. Thereafter, Executive may correct such breach or threatened breach to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Bank; <U>provided that </U>if Executive fails to correct such breach or threatened breach within such two-day period, nothing contained herein shall preclude or delay the Bank&#146;s ability to seek a temporary
restraining order hereunder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7. Miscellaneous: </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7.1 Mitigation Not Required.</B> As a condition of any payment hereunder, Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of such payment by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on the part of Executive under this Agreement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7.2 Enforcement of This Agreement.</B> In addition to the equitable remedies provided under Section&nbsp;6 hereof, which need not be exclusively resolved
by arbitration in the discretion of the Bank, in the event that any legal dispute arises in connection with, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, or in the event of any claim for breach or violation of any provision of this Agreement,
Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will be resolved by arbitration. Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (&#147;AAA&#148;) concerning the resolution of
employment disputes. Any such dispute or claim will be presented to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the Executive and the Bank (or the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA). All determinations of
the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the Executive and the Bank. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;7.3 hereof, each party to the arbitration proceeding will bear its own fees and costs in connection with such arbitration proceedings,
<U>except that</U> unless otherwise paid by the Bank in accordance with such section, the costs and expenses of the arbitrator will be divided evenly between the parties. The venue for any arbitration proceeding and for any judicial proceeding
related to this arbitration provision (including a judicial proceeding to enforce this provision) will be in Jackson, Mississippi. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7.3 Attorneys&#146;
Fees. </B>In the event any dispute in connection with this Agreement arises with respect to obligations of Executive or the Bank, as the case may be, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys&#146;
fees, costs, and all expenses incurred in that action or proceeding. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7.4 No Set-Off or Defense. </B>There shall be no right of <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">set-off</FONT> or counterclaim in respect of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment to Executive provided for in this Agreement. Executive&#146;s claim that the Bank has breached this Agreement shall not
constitute a justification or defense for Executive&#146;s breach of any provision hereof. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>7.5 Assistance with Litigation. </B>For a period of two
years after his Separation Date, Executive will furnish such information and provide such assistance as may be reasonably necessary in connection with any litigation in which the Bank (or an affiliate) is then or may become involved, without the
payment of a fee or charge, except reimbursement of his direct expenses. </P>

agreement not been terminated and Executive&#146;s employment been terminated by the Company without cause immediately after the change in control resulting under the Merger Agreement. Neither the Metropolitan Entities nor Renasant Corporation
