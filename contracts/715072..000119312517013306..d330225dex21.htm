companies and their respective sole stockholder to consummate the business
combination transactions provided for in the Subsidiary Merger Document and
herein, including the merger of Seller Sub with and into Acquiror Sub on the
terms and conditions set forth therein and herein;

WHEREAS, it is the intention of the parties that, for federal income tax
purposes, the Parent Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to provide for certain undertakings, conditions,
representations, warranties and covenants in connection with the transactions

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements herein contained, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, Seller shall be merged with and into Acquiror (the "Parent Merger") in
accordance with the Mississippi Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA") and the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), with Acquiror
as the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving
Corporation") which shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of
the State of Mississippi, and the separate corporate existence of Seller
shall terminate. The Parent Merger shall in all respects have the effects
provided in Section 1.5 hereof.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, immediately after
the Effective Time of the Parent Merger, Seller Sub shall be merged with and
into Acquiror Sub (the "Subsidiary Merger" and, together with the Parent
Merger, the "Mergers") in accordance with Title 81 of the Mississippi Code of
1972, as amended, with Acquiror Sub as the surviving banking corporation
(hereinafter sometimes called the "Subsidiary Surviving Bank") which
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Mississippi, and the

 



1  separate corporate existence of Seller Sub shall terminate. The Subsidiary
Merger shall in all respects have the effects provided in Section 1.5 hereof.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Parent Merger shall become effective on the later of
the dates and times that the Articles of Merger are filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Mississippi pursuant to Section 79-4-11.06 of the
MBCA and the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State pursuant to Section 252(c) of the DGCL, such Articles of Merger and
Certificate of Merger to be substantially in the forms attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (the "Parent Merger Documents"), unless a later date and time is
specified as the effective time in such documents, _provided_ , that the
parties shall cause the Parent Merger to be effective no later than the day
following the date on which the Closing occurs (the "Effective Time"). The
Subsidiary Merger shall become effective upon the date and time specified
in the Certificate of Merger Approval issued by the Mississippi Commissioner
of Banking and Consumer Finance ("MCB") based on the Articles of Merger filed
with the MCB and thereafter with the Mississippi Secretary of State,
such Articles of Merger to be substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_ (the "Subsidiary Merger Document" and, together with the Parent
Merger Documents, the "Merger Documents"). On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. no later than the fifth Business Day following the receipt
of all necessary approvals and consents of any foreign, federal, state, local
or other court, tribunal, body, board, administrative agency, arbitrator,
mediator or commission or other governmental, prosecutorial, regulatory or
self-regulatory authority (including stock exchanges) or
instrumentality ("Governmental Entity"), and the expiration of all statutory
waiting periods in respect thereof and the satisfaction or waiver, to the
extent permitted hereunder, of the conditions to the consummation of the
Mergers specified in Article VI (other than the delivery of certificates,
instruments and documents to be delivered at the Closing), at the offices of
Acquiror, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as
the parties may mutually agree upon (the "Closing Date"), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Closing occurs at any time after such fifth Business
Day following the receipt of all necessary approvals and consents, the Closing
shall occur on the first Business Day of the next month after the date on
which all conditions to closing described in this sentence are satisfied,
unless the parties otherwise agree to a different date. For purposes of this
Agreement, a Business Day ("Business Day") is any day, other than a Saturday,
Sunday or any other day that banks located in the State of Mississippi are not
permitted to be open or are required to be closed. At the Closing, there shall
be delivered to Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Seller and Seller Sub the
certificates and other documents required to be delivered under Article VI
hereof.

1.3 _The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
and the Subsidiary Surviving Bank_. The articles of incorporation and bylaws
of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub, each as in effect immediately prior to the

removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporations board of directors shall
consider in good faith the nomination for reelection of the Seller Designee at
each subsequent annual meeting of the Surviving Corporations stockholders
through the 2019 annual meeting. The officers of Acquiror shall, from and
after the Effective Time, continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors shall have been duly

 



2  elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) Prior to the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, the parties shall
take all appropriate actions so that, as of the effective time of the
Subsidiary Merger, and subject to and in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Acquiror Sub, the number of directors of the

annual meeting of the Subsidiary Surviving Banks sole stockholder through the
2019 annual meeting. The officers of Acquiror Sub shall, from and after the
effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, continue as the officers of
the Subsidiary Surviving Bank until their successors shall have been duly
elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Subsidiary Surviving Bank. 

1.5 _Effect of the Mergers_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Seller shall cease, and
all right, title and interest in and to all real estate and other property
owned by, and every contract right possessed by, Seller shall be vested in
Acquiror, as the surviving corporation, without reversion or impairment,
without further act or deed and without any transfer or assignment having
occurred (but subject to any existing liens or other encumbrances thereon),
and all liabilities of Seller shall be vested in Acquiror, as the surviving
corporation, as primary obligor therefor and, except as set forth herein, no
other person shall be liable therefor, and all proceedings pending by or
against Seller shall be continued by or against Acquiror, as the surviving
corporation, and all liabilities, obligations, assets or rights associated
with such proceedings shall be vested in Acquiror, as the surviving
corporation.

(b) At the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, the separate existence of
Seller Sub shall cease, and all right, title and interest in and to all real
estate and other property owned by, and every contract right possessed by,
Seller Sub shall be vested in Acquiror Sub, as the surviving bank, without
reversion or impairment, without further act or deed and without any transfer
or assignment having occurred (but subject to any existing liens or other
encumbrances thereon), and all liabilities of Seller Sub shall be vested in
Acquiror Sub, as the surviving bank, as primary obligor therefor and, except
as set forth herein, no other person shall be liable therefor, and all
proceedings pending by or against Seller Sub shall be continued by or against
Acquiror Sub, as the surviving bank, and all liabilities, obligations, assets
or rights associated with such proceedings shall be vested in Acquiror Sub,
as the surviving bank.

1.6 _Tax Consequences_. The parties acknowledge and agree that it is intended
that the Parent Merger constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is
adopted as the "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354
and 361 of the Code. From and after the date of this Agreement and until the
Closing, each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the
Code.

 



3 ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGERS ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT

 

ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any action on the
part of Acquiror, Seller or the holder of any of the following securities:



     | (i) | Each share of Acquiror Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
after the Effective Time and shall not be affected by the Parent Merger.  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each
share of Sellers common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Seller Common
Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Seller Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.1(a)(v) and shares held by Dissenting Stockholders) shall,
subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iv), be
converted automatically into and thereafter represent the right to receive
the number of shares (or a fraction thereof) of Acquiror Common Stock, rounded
to the nearest four decimals, equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger
Consideration"). As used in this Agreement, the term "Acquiror Common Stock"
means the common stock, $5.00 par value per share, of Acquiror; the term
"Exchange Ratio" means 0.6066. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller Common
Stock shall be exchanged for certificates evidencing the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be
made pursuant to Section 2.1(b). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding
shares of capital stock of Acquiror or Seller shall occur (or for which the
relevant record date will occur) as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or other
subdivision, combination or readjustment of shares, or as a result of any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of
Seller and each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Acquiror or any
subsidiary of Acquiror or Seller (other than shares held in trust accounts,
managed accounts, mutual funds and the like or otherwise in a fiduciary or
agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall
automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof
and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. 
---|---|--- 
 

(b) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued as a result of the Parent Merger. In lieu of the
issuance of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(a), cash adjustments
(without interest) will be paid to each holder of Seller Common Stock in
respect of any fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that would
otherwise be issuable to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the amount
of such cash adjustment shall be determined by multiplying (x) the fraction of
a share of Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable by (y) the weighted
average of the closing sale prices of one share of Acquiror Common Stock as
reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, for the 15 consecutive trading
days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. No such
holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other right of
stockholders in respect of any fractional share.

 



4 2.2 _Exchange of Seller Stock Certificates_.

 

(a) Acquiror has appointed Computershare, Inc. to serve as exchange agent in
connection with the Parent Merger for the purpose of exchanging shares of
Seller Common Stock for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or
immediately following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit in trust with
the Exchange Agent for the benefit of Sellers stockholders the aggregate
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the aggregate Merger
Consideration (such shares of Acquiror Common Stock, together with cash
sufficient to make payments required with respect to fractional shares
of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and pay any
dividends or distributions with respect to such Acquiror Common Stock in
accordance with Section 2.4, the "Exchange Fund"). Acquiror shall deposit
such shares of Acquiror Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by delivering to
the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to the Exchange
Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares and immediately available
funds for such cash in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.4.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to the former record holders of the shares of
Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (other than shares held by
Dissenting Stockholders): (i) a letter of transmittal (which letter shall
specify that the delivery of the Merger Consideration shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
certificate(s) formerly representing shares of Seller Common Stock (each a
"Seller Stock Certificate") to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of such certificate(s)) and shall otherwise be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Seller Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. After
the Effective Time, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent by the holder
thereof of the Seller Stock Certificate(s) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, together with a letter of transmittal duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and any other
documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent on
behalf of Acquiror shall deliver the Merger Consideration (in the form of an
uncertificated share of Acquiror Common Stock, unless such holder specifically
requests a certificated share) to each such holder in exchange for each such
share plus a check in the amount (if any) equal to any cash that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and, if applicable,
Section 2.4 hereof, without interest. Holders of record of shares of Seller
Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in
other representative capacities (a "Representative") may submit multiple
letters of transmittal, provided that such Representative certifies that each
such letter of transmittal covers all the shares of Seller Common Stock held
by such Representative for a particular beneficial owner. Each Seller Stock
Certificate so surrendered and all transmittal materials shall be duly
completed and endorsed as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require. The
Exchange Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to
which any former holder of Seller Common Stock is entitled as a result of the
Parent Merger until such holder surrenders his, her or its Seller Stock
Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificate(s)) for
exchange as provided in this Section 2.2. After the Effective Time, each
certificate that represented outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock prior
to the Effective Time shall be deemed for all corporate purposes (other than
the payment of dividends and other distributions to which the former
stockholders of Seller Common Stock may be entitled) to evidence only the
right of the holder thereof to receive the Merger Consideration in exchange
for each such share as provided in this Article II. Acquiror shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to promptly pay the Merger Consideration following the
receipt of each letter of transmittal.

 

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Exchange Agent that remains
unclaimed by the former stockholders of Seller for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Acquiror upon demand, and any former
stockholders of Seller who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.2
shall thereafter look only to Acquiror for payment of their claims for
Acquiror Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock or any dividends or distributions with respect to Acquiror Common
Stock (all without any interest thereon). Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to

 



5  the time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Acquiror free and clear of any claims or interest of
any person or entity entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Acquiror, Seller, any subsidiary of Acquiror or Seller or the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Common
Stock for shares of Acquiror Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with
respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock
delivered in good faith to public officials pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Seller Stock
Certificate(s) shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of
Seller Common Stock represented thereby except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. All rights to receive the Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of the shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to this
Article II shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Seller Common Stock.

 

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name the shares of Seller Common Stock so
surrendered are registered, it shall be a condition to such issuance that each
Seller Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer, and the person requesting such issuance shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result
of such issuance to a person other than the registered holder of such Seller
Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Acquiror or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, without duplication,
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Seller Common Stock such amounts as Acquiror or the Exchange Agent
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment and shall further be entitled
to sell Acquiror Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to this Agreement
to satisfy any such withholding requirement (which Acquiror Common Stock will
be valued with respect to such withholding at the average of the high and low
trading prices thereof on the day of such sale). To the extent the amounts are
so withheld by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Seller Common
Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Acquiror
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

(f) In the event any Seller Stock Certificate(s) shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Seller Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Acquiror or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of
a bond in such amount as either of them may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Seller Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Seller Stock
Certificate(s) the Merger Consideration (together with a check in the amount
(if any) of any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section
2.4).

 

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash balances in the Exchange Fund in
a demand deposit account or as directed by Acquiror. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Acquiror upon
termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. No outstanding share of Seller Common Stock as to
which the holder has exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
and did not vote for the adoption of this Agreement shall be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holder thereof
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL, _provided_
, such stockholder complies with the procedures and perfects the rights
contemplated by and set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Seller
shall give Acquiror notice as promptly as practicable upon receipt by
Seller of any such written demands for payment of the fair value of such
shares of the Seller Common Stock and of withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments provided pursuant to the DGCL (any stockholder duly making
such demand being hereinafter called a "Dissenting Stockholder"). Acquiror
and Seller shall reasonably cooperate in all negotiations and proceedings

 



6  with respect to any such demands or notices by a Dissenting Stockholder.
Seller shall not, without the prior written consent of Acquiror, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any payment
with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such
demands. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment, such
holders shares of Seller Common Stock shall be automatically converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement.

 

2.4 _Rights as Stockholders_. All shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
as Merger Consideration shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. Former stockholders of Seller and any other persons who are
entitled to receive Acquiror Common Stock as a result of the Parent Merger
will be able to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of
Acquiror stockholders or pursuant to any written consent procedure the number
of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock into which their shares of Seller
Common Stock are converted, regardless of whether they have exchanged their
Seller Stock Certificates. In addition, whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Acquiror on the Acquiror Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends
or other distributions on all shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable
hereunder, but no stockholder will be entitled to receive his, her or its
distribution of such dividends or other distributions until physical exchange
of such stockholders Seller Stock Certificates shall have been
effected. Upon exchange of a stockholders Seller Stock Certificates, any
such person shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror an amount equal to all
dividends or other distributions (without interest thereon less the amount of
any taxes, if any, that have been withheld by, imposed on or paid by Acquiror
or the Exchange Agent with respect to such dividends) declared, and for which
the payment has occurred, on the shares represented thereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that former stockholders of Seller shall not be entitled to
receive any dividend on their Acquiror Common Stock with respect to any period
for which Acquiror paid a dividend prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.5 _Stock Transfer Records_. Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall
continue to maintain its stock transfer records and to transfer and replace
stock certificates in accordance with its existing policies and past practices
with regard to such transfers and replacements. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration or transfers on the stock
transfer books of Seller or Acquiror of shares of Seller Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than
to settle transfers of Seller Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If after the Effective Time, the Seller Stock Certificates
are presented for transfer to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

2.6 _Subsidiary Merger_. At the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger, each
share of common stock, $5.00 par value per share, of Seller Sub (the "Seller
Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Subsidiary Merger shall automatically be cancelled and there shall
be no conversion or exchange of, or consideration paid or issued for, such
Seller Sub Common Stock. The certificate or certificates for such Seller Sub
Common Stock shall be surrendered and cancelled. All of the shares of Acquiror
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Subsidiary Merger shall remain issued and outstanding after the effective time
of the Subsidiary Merger and shall be unaffected by the Subsidiary Merger.

 

2.7 _Seller Stock Options, Seller Restricted Stock and Related Matters_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Parent Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of
Seller Common Stock (collectively, "Seller Stock Options") granted by Seller
under the Metropolitan BancGroup, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Seller
Stock Plan") or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and converted into
an obligation of Acquiror to pay (or cause to be paid) and a right of the
holder to receive, in full satisfaction of any rights in respect of the
Seller Stock Option, a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of $25.50 over
the exercise price per share of Seller Common Stock

 



7  subject to such Seller Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such
payment to the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less the amount of
any required withholding Tax. No holder of a Seller Stock Option that has an
exercise price per share of Seller Common Stock that is equal to or greater
than $25.50 shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled
Seller Stock Option before, on, or after the Effective Time. Acquiror shall
pay (or cause to be paid) to the holders of Seller Stock Options the cash
payments described in this Section 2.7(a) on or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within ten Business
Days following the Closing Date.

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Seller Common Stock subject to
restrictions on transfer and/or forfeiture granted under the Seller Stock
Plan or otherwise ("Seller Restricted Stock") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, less the amount of any required withholding Tax, in
accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii).

 

(c) Before the Effective Time, Sellers compensation committee of its board of
directors shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
reasonably required to effect the transactions described in this Section 2.7.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall notify each holder of Seller
Stock Options and/or Seller Restricted Stock (which form notices shall be
provided to Acquiror for review and comment in advance of distribution to
holders of Seller Stock Options and/or Seller Restricted Stock) stating that
such holders Seller Stock Options and/or Seller Restricted Stock shall be
treated in the manner set forth in Section 2.7(a) and (b) hereof,
respectively, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from such
holder a written acknowledgement of the receipt of such Seller notice.

Except as disclosed in writing in the correspondingly enumerated section or
subsection of the disclosure schedule of Seller and Seller Sub delivered
herewith (the "Seller Disclosure Schedule") ( _provided_ , that each exception
set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify any
other representation and warranty to the extent that the relevance of such
exception to such other representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on
the face of the disclosure (without need to examine underlying
documentation)), Seller and Seller Sub, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant as of the date hereof to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub as set forth in
this Article III. The Seller Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article
III. The phrase "provided to Acquiror", "delivered to Acquiror" or "made

Seller Sub has delivered, provided access to or made certain items available
for review and copying to Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or their counsel. For
purposes of this Article III, the phrase "to the Knowledge of Seller," the
phrase "to Sellers Knowledge" or any phrase of similar import shall be

Sub listed on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3_ after reasonable investigation.

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Seller has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed
or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location
of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed, qualified
or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The term
"Seller Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change, state of facts,
circumstance, event or development which, individually or in the

 



8  aggregate, would reasonably be expected to either (i) materially impair
Sellers or Seller Subs ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or consummate the Mergers on a timely basis or (ii) have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Seller, Seller Sub or any
of the other Subsidiaries, taken individually or as a whole, other than, as
to subpart (ii), (A) effects resulting from the impact of any action taken by
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries with the prior written consent of Acquiror
or required expressly by this Agreement or any action not taken by Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such action is expressly prohibited by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of Acquiror and Acquiror has
not consented to such action; (B) changes in Laws or interpretations thereof
that are generally applicable to the banking industry; (C) changes in
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks or
their holding companies generally; (D) expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Mergers including payments to be made pursuant to
employment and severance agreements and the termination of other benefit
plans; (E) changes attributable to or resulting from changes that are the
result of factors generally affecting financial institutions including changes
in interest rates; (F) changes in general economic, market, political or
regulatory conditions in the United States; (G) a failure, in and of itself,
to meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not
including any underlying causes thereof; (H) any outbreak or escalation of
hostilities, declared or undeclared acts of war or terrorism; or (I) the
impact of the announcement of this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that as to each of clauses (B),
(C), (E), (F) or (H), such change, state of facts, circumstance, event or
development does not have a disproportionate effect on Seller or Seller Sub as
compared to other financial institutions or their holding companies. Seller is
registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956, as amended, and (together with Seller Sub) is a member in good standing
of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and owns the requisite amount of stock
therein. Seller has furnished or made available to Acquiror true and complete

on the date hereof.

 

(b) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.1(b)_ lists the direct and indirect
subsidiaries of Seller (collectively, the "Subsidiaries"), in which Seller
owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares or

State of Mississippi. Seller Sub is not a member of the Federal Reserve
System. Seller Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease all of its properties and assets and to conduct its business as it is
now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, or to have
such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. 

(c) Each of the Subsidiaries other than Seller Sub, is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction
of organization. Each of the Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, limited
liability company or trust power and authority, as applicable, to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to conduct its business as it is now
being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, or to have
such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Other than as listed on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.1(b)_ and Seller
Subs ownership of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Seller does
not own or control, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity
interest in any other entity.

are no voting trusts, stockholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in

outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock and all outstanding shares of
the capital stock of Seller Sub have been issued in material compliance with
applicable federal and state securities Laws, and none of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other security of Seller has been issued in
violation of any preemptive rights of the current or past stockholders of
Seller. All of the outstanding shares of Seller Sub Common Stock are owned by
Seller free and clear of any liens, encumbrances, charges, restrictions or
rights of third parties of any kind whatsoever. Except for outstanding Seller
Stock Options, neither Seller, Seller Sub nor any of the other Subsidiaries
has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights,
calls, commitments or agreements of any character calling for the transfer,
purchase, redemption or issuance of any shares of Seller Common Stock or
Seller Sub Common Stock or any securities representing the right to purchase
or otherwise receive any shares of such capital stock or any securities
convertible into or representing the right to purchase or subscribe for any
such stock. As of the date of this Agreement, no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which Seller
stockholders may vote are outstanding.

(a) Subject to the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby by the stockholders of Seller and Seller Sub, Seller and
Seller Sub have all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the Merger Documents, as applicable, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with
the terms hereof and thereof. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the Merger Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Mergers, have been duly and validly approved
by the unanimous vote of the Boards of Directors of Seller and Seller Sub, as
applicable, and the Board of Directors of Seller has determined to recommend
that the stockholders of Seller adopt and approve the Parent Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Except for the approval of Sellers
stockholders of this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby
on substantially the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, no
other corporate or similar proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to
consummate the transactions so contemplated other than the filing of the
Parent Merger Documents as contemplated in Section 1.2. Except for the
approval of Seller Subs sole stockholder of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby on substantially the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, no other corporate or similar proceedings on the
part of Seller Sub are necessary to consummate the transactions so
contemplated other than the filing of the Subsidiary Merger Document as

other approvals described in this Agreement, this Agreement and the Merger

Knowledge, announcement by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries relating to, or,
to Sellers Knowledge, change in employee participation or coverage under, any
Seller Plan which would materially increase the expense of maintaining such

Agreement, approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of Seller or Seller
Sub nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (individually
or in conjunction with any other event) will (i) accelerate the time of

approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of Seller or Seller Sub nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (individually or in
conjunction with any other event) will result in amounts paid or payable that
would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code.

 

(f) Except as set forth on _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(f)_ , there are no
outstanding compensatory equity awards, including any contracts or
arrangements awarding stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted

provider of or to Seller or the Subsidiaries. With respect to the Seller

to or greater than the fair market value (determined in accordance with
Section 409A of the Code) of the underlying shares of Seller Common Stock as
of their effective grant date and (ii) the effective date of grant of all such
options was either the date of approval by Sellers board of directors or the
compensation committee of Sellers board of directors or a later date
specified by such board of directors or compensation committee, as applicable.

form all monthly, quarterly and annual reports, forms, correspondence,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that they were required to file with the MCB, the FDIC,
the FRB and any other federal or state Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over Seller and/or Seller Sub, and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the failure
to file (or furnish, as applicable) such monthly, quarterly and annual
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements or to pay such
fees and assessments, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably
likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. As of their filing date, each
such report or other filing did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. To the extent not
prohibited by Law, Seller has delivered or made available to Acquiror accurate
and complete copies of such reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and
statements. There is no unresolved violation, criticism or exception by
the MCB, the FDIC, the FRB and any other federal or state Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over Seller and/or Seller Sub with respect to any such
report or relating to any examination or inspection of Seller or Seller Sub
which would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Other than its normal
examinations, there is no proceeding, examination or investigation pending or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened by any Governmental Entity with
respect to Sellers business or operations.

Seller, as amended or supplemented (or on any successor or other appropriate
schedule or form) (the "Registration Statement"), or in any application,
notification or other document to be filed with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will, as of

other application, notification or other document are so filed, as the case
may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading (except that this representation shall not apply to any
information in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or
such other applications, notifications or other documents supplied by Acquiror
or Acquiror Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein), provided
that information as of a later date shall be deemed to modify information as
of an earlier date.

order, writ, decree or injunction of any court or other Governmental Entity
material to the business or operations of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries,

the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Governmental Entity asserting that Seller or any
of the Subsidiaries is in violation of or default with respect to any of the
foregoing, except for such violations or defaults which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is subject to any
regulatory or supervisory cease and desist order, agreement, written
directive, memorandum of understanding or written commitment (other than those

its Community Development Capital Initiative.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller and
Seller Sub is in compliance with applicable Laws related to data protection or
privacy, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, Sections 23A and 23B of
the Federal Reserve Act or the regulations implementing such Laws, all
applicable Financial Crimes Enforcement Network requirements, all other
applicable anti-money laundering Laws, fair lending Laws and other Laws
relating to discriminatory lending, financing, leasing or business practices
and all agency requirements relating to the origination, sale and servicing of
mortgage loans, 

 



17  except when the failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be likely
to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been advised in writing of any material supervisory
criticisms regarding their compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act or related
state or federal anti-money laundering laws, regulations and guidelines. Each
of Seller and Seller Sub has timely and properly filed and maintained in all
material respects all requisite Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious
Activity Reports and has properly monitored transaction activity (including,
but not limited to, wire transfers). Seller and Seller Sub have neither had
nor suspected any material incidents of fraud or defalcation during the last
two years.

3.12 _Deposit Insurance and Other Regulatory Matters_. The deposit accounts
of Seller Sub are insured by the FDIC to the maximum extent permitted by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the "FDIA"), and Seller Sub has
paid when due all premiums and assessments required by the FDIA and the
regulations thereunder. No action, suit or proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, has been threatened by the FDIC against Seller or Seller
Sub with respect to the termination of such insurance. As of the date hereof,
other than reciprocal deposit accounts obtained through Promontory
Interfinancial Network, LLC, none of Seller Subs deposits or deposits of any
of its Subsidiaries are "brokered" deposits (as such term is defined in 12
C.F.R. § 337.6(a)(2)) or are subject to any material encumbrance, legal
restraint or other legal process (other than garnishments, pledges, liens,
levies, subpoenas, set off rights, escrow limitations and similar actions
taken in the ordinary course of business), and no portion of such deposits
represents a deposit of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

3.13 _Certain Contracts_.

(a) Except as disclosed in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a)_ , neither
Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to, is bound or affected by,
receives or is obligated to pay compensation or benefits under (i) any
agreement, arrangement or commitment, including any agreement, indenture or
other instrument relating to the borrowing of money by Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries or the guarantee by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries of any
obligation except for deposit liabilities, federal funds purchased, borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank and securities repurchase agreements entered
into in the ordinary course of business; (ii) any contract, agreement or
understanding with a labor union; (iii) any agreement, arrangement or
understanding pursuant to which any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise) became or may become due to any director, officer or employee of
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries upon execution of this Agreement or upon or
following consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(either alone or in connection with the occurrence of any additional acts or
events); (iv) any agreement, arrangement or understanding to which Seller or
any of the Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound which
limits the freedom of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries to compete in any
line of business or with any person, or that involve any restriction of the
geographic area in which, or method by which, they may carry on their business
(other than as may be required by Law or any Governmental Entity); (v) any
assistance agreement, supervisory agreement, memorandum of understanding,
consent order, cease and desist order or condition of any regulatory order or
decree with or by the FRB, the FDIC or any other regulatory agency (and no
such agreement, memorandum or order imposes any obligation on Seller or any
of the Subsidiaries to make any additional capital contributions); (vi) any
joint venture, partnership or similar agreement, arrangement or understanding
providing for the sharing of profits, losses, costs or liabilities by Seller
or Seller Sub with any other person; (vii) any purchase and assumption
agreement with the FDIC; or (viii) any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding to which Seller or any of the Subsidiaries is a party and which
is material to the business, operations assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Seller and the
Subsidiaries, taken individually or as a whole (excluding loan agreements or
agreements relating to deposit accounts); in each of the foregoing cases
whether written or oral (each such agreement listed, or required to be listed,
in this Section 3.13(a) is referred to herein as a "Seller Agreement").
Except as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a)_ , neither Seller
nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
commitment relating to the employment of a consultant or the
employment, retirement, election or retention in office of any present or
former director, officer or employee of Seller or Seller Sub (other than those
which are terminable at will without any further amounts being payable
thereunder as a result of termination by Seller or Seller Sub).

 



18 (b) Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries is in default or in non-
compliance under any Seller Agreement, and there has not occurred any event
that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute
such a default or non-compliance, except for such default or non-compliance
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to
result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller Agreement is valid,
binding and enforceable against, as applicable, Seller or any Subsidiary and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, the other parties thereto in accordance with
their respective terms, except as limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception, and is in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and
all rents and other monetary amounts that may have become due and
payable thereunder have been paid, except for such failures to be valid,
binding and enforceable, to be in full force and effect or to have paid all
rents and other monetary amounts which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

3.14 _Properties and Insurance_.

 

(a) All of the tangible assets and other personal property owned or leased by
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries or presently used by either of them in
their respective business is in good condition (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and is sufficient to carry on the business of Seller and Seller Sub
in the ordinary course consistent with past practices. Seller and each of the
Subsidiaries have title and, as to owned real property, good and marketable
title to all material assets and properties, whether real or personal,
tangible or intangible, reflected in Sellers consolidated unaudited balance
sheet as of September 30, 2016 or owned and acquired subsequent thereto
(except for such assets and properties that have been disposed of for fair
value in the ordinary course of business since September 30, 2016), subject to
no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i)
those items that secure liabilities that are reflected in said consolidated
balance sheet or the notes thereto or have been incurred in the ordinary
course of business after the date of such consolidated balance sheet; (ii)
statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in
good faith and for which adequate reserves have been made in the Seller
Financial Statements; (iii) liens for real property Taxes not yet due
and payable; (iv) such encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests,
pledges and title imperfections that are not in the aggregate material to the
business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise)
or results of operations of Seller and Seller Sub, taken individually or as a
whole; and (v) with respect to owned real property, (x) easements, rights-of-
way, covenants, consents, restrictions, encroachments, variations and other
restrictions, charges or encumbrances (whether recorded or not) that do not
interfere materially with the ordinary course of Sellers business or the
business of any Subsidiary at such property, (y) building restrictions, zoning
laws and other Laws, now or at any time hereafter adopted by any Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction that do not materially interfere with the ordinary
course of Sellers or Seller Subs business, or (z) imperfections or
irregularities of title noted in title reports delivered to Acquiror prior to
the date hereof (items (i)  (v) are collectively referred to herein as
"Permitted Liens"). Seller and each of the Subsidiaries as lessees have the
right under valid and subsisting leases to occupy, use, possess and control
all property leased by them in all respects as presently occupied, used,
possessed and controlled by Seller and such Subsidiaries. _Seller Disclosure
Schedule 3.14(a)_ sets forth an accurate listing of each lease pursuant to
which Seller or any of the Subsidiaries acts as lessor or lessee, including
the expiration date and the terms of any renewal options which relate to the
same. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has any legal obligation,
absolute or contingent, to any other person to sell or otherwise dispose of
any substantial part of its assets or to sell or dispose of any of its assets
except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices. 

(b) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14(b)_ sets forth a list of all policies of
fire, theft, public liability, business interruption and other insurance
(including fidelity bonds insurance) maintained by Seller and the Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof. The business operations and all insurable properties
and assets of Seller and the Subsidiaries are insured for their
benefit against all risks (including flood) which, to the Knowledge of
Seller, should be insured against, in each case, under valid, binding and
enforceable policies or bonds issued by insurers of recognized responsibility,
in such amounts with such deductibles and against such risks and losses as
are, to the Knowledge of Seller, adequate for the business engaged in by
Seller and such Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, neither Seller nor any of
the Subsidiaries has received any written notice of cancellation or written
notice of a material amendment of any such insurance policy or bond or is in
default under such policy or bond, all

 



19  premiums and other payments due under any such policy or bond have been
paid, no coverage thereunder is being disputed, and all material claims
thereunder have been or will be filed in a timely fashion.

3.15 _Environmental Matters_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the indicated meaning:

 

"Environmental Law" means any Law, license, permit, authorization, approval,
consent, order, judgment, decree, injunction or agreement with any
Governmental Entity relating to (1) the protection, preservation or
restoration of the environment (including air, water vapor, surface water,
groundwater, drinking water supply, surface soil, subsurface soil, plant
and animal life or any other natural resource); and/or (2) the use, storage,
recycling, treatment, generation, transportation, processing, handling,
labeling, production, release or disposal of Hazardous Substances. The term
"Environmental Law" includes (1) the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, et seq.;
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section
6901, et seq.; the Clean Air Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 7401, et
seq.; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. Section
1251, et seq.; the Toxic Substances Control Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. Section
9601, et seq.; the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, 42
U.S.C. Section 11001, et seq.; the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. Section
300f, et seq.; and all comparable state and local Laws, and (2) any common law
(including common law that may impose strict liability) that may impose
liability or obligations for injuries or damages due to, or threatened as a
result of, the presence of or exposure to any Hazardous Substance.

 

"Hazardous Substance" means any substance presently listed, defined,
designated or classified as hazardous, toxic, radioactive or dangerous, or
otherwise regulated, under any Environmental Law, whether by type or by
quantity, including any regulated material containing any such substance as a
component. Hazardous Substances include petroleum (including crude oil or any
fraction thereof), friable asbestos, radioactive material and polychlorinated
biphenyls, _provided_ , notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, the words "Hazardous Substance" shall not
mean or include any of such naturally occurring in any ambient air, surface
water, ground water, land surface or surface strata.

 

"Loan Portfolio Properties and Other Properties Owned" means those properties
owned, leased or operated by a person or its subsidiaries or those properties
which serve as collateral for loans owned by a person or its subsidiaries.

or liable under any Environmental Law, (ii) none of the Loan Portfolio
Properties and Other Properties Owned by Seller or Seller Sub has been or is
in violation of or, to the Knowledge of Seller, liable under any
Environmental Law, and (iii) there are no actions, suits, demands, written

Seller, threatened, relating to the Loan Portfolio Properties and
Other Properties Owned by Seller or Seller Sub under any Environmental Law,
including any notices, demand letters or written requests for information from
any federal or state environmental agency relating to any such liabilities
under or violations of Environmental Law.

3.16 _Allowance for Loan Losses and Real Estate Owned_. The allowance for loan
losses reflected on Sellers consolidated balance sheets included in the
Seller Financial Statements is in compliance with Sellers existing
methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and
was, at the time recorded, or will be in the case of subsequently delivered
financial statements, as the case may be, adequate in all material respects as
of their respective dates under the requirements of GAAP and the standards
formally established by applicable Governmental Entities to provide
for reasonably anticipated losses on outstanding loans net of recoveries. The
real estate owned reflected on the consolidated balance sheets included in the
Seller Financial Statements was, at the time recorded, or will be in the case
of subsequently delivered financial statements, as the case may be, carried
at the lower of cost or fair value, or the lower of cost or net realizable
value, as required by GAAP.

 



20 3.17 _Minute Books_. Since January 1, 2013, the minute books, including any
attachments thereto, of Seller and the Subsidiaries contain complete and
accurate records in all material respects of all meetings and other material
corporate action held or taken by their respective boards of directors or
comparable governing bodies (including committees thereof) and stockholders,
members or trustees, as applicable.

3.18 _Affiliate Transactions_. Except for (i) deposit agreements entered into
in the ordinary course of business with customers of Seller Sub; (ii) loans
covered by the second sentence of Section 3.23(a); and (iii) obligations under
employee benefit plans set forth on  _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.8(a)_ ,
and except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, since January 1,
2013, neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has engaged in or agreed to
engage in (whether in writing or orally) any transaction with any
"affiliate," as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act.

3.19 _Internal Controls_. Seller and the Subsidiaries have implemented and
maintain in accordance with applicable Law a system of internal controls over
financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and which includes
policies and procedures that (i) all transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain accountability for assets, (ii) access to Sellers assets is
permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (iii) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals, and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences. Seller has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit
committee of its board of directors (i) any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Sellers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Sellers
internal controls over financial reporting.

 

3.20 _Risk Management Instruments_. All interest rate swaps, caps, floors,
option agreements, futures and forward contracts (including commitments to
sell mortgage loans) and other similar risk management arrangements
(collectively, the "Risk Management Instruments"), whether entered into for
Sellers own account or for the account of one or more of Seller Sub or its
customers, were entered into, to the Knowledge of Seller, (i) in accordance
with prudent business practices and all applicable Laws and (ii) with
counterparties reasonably believed at the time to be financially responsible;
and each of the Risk Management Instruments are valid and legally binding
obligations of Seller or Seller Sub; and are enforceable in accordance with
their terms (except as limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception), and
are in full force and effect. Except as would not reasonably be likely to
result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, Seller and its Subsidiaries have
in place risk management policies and procedures sufficient in scope and
operation to protect against risks of the type and in amounts reasonably
expected to be incurred by entities of similar size and in similar lines of
business as Seller or the applicable Subsidiary. Seller and Seller Sub have
duly performed in all material respects all of their obligations under
Risk Management Instruments to the extent such obligations to perform have
accrued. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no breaches, violations or
defaults, or allegations or assertions thereof by any party thereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the date hereof, no
events or circumstances have occurred, or are reasonably likely to occur prior
to the Effective Time, that would require Seller or Seller Sub to repurchase
any mortgage loans sold to secondary market investors, nor has any such
investor made any assertion to that effect.

3.21 _Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the board of
directors of Seller has received the oral opinion (to be confirmed in writing)
of its financial advisor, Raymond James and Associates, Inc., to the effect
that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the
assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Seller Common Stock.
Seller shall furnish an accurate and complete copy of such opinion to
Acquiror, solely for informational purposes, as promptly as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement. Such opinion has not been amended
or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

 



21 3.22 _Broker Fees_. Except as set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.22_ ,
neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
directors or officers has employed any consultant, broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any consultants, brokers or finders fees or
commissions in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

3.23 _Loans_.

 

(a) All of the loans and other evidences of indebtedness (including
commitments to extend credit) held in Sellers, Seller Subs or any
Subsidiaries loan portfolio are valid and properly documented in all material
respects by notes, agreements and other evidences of indebtedness and were
solicited and originated, and are and have been administered and serviced, in
the ordinary course of business consistent with Seller and Seller Subs
underwriting standards, and the security therefor, if any, is valid and
properly perfected in all material respects, and no material collateral has
been released from the lien granted to Seller and Seller Sub with respect to
any such loans unless approved by Seller and Seller Sub and documented in
their files. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made by Seller
Sub that are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended,
and Regulation O (12 C.F.R. Part 215) promulgated thereunder, comply therewith
in all material respects. There are no employee, officer, director or other
affiliate loans on which the borrower is paying a rate other than that
reflected in the note or other relevant credit or security agreement or on
which the borrower is paying a rate which was not in compliance with
Regulation O. Neither the terms of such loans nor any of the loan
documentation nor the manner in which such loans have been originated,
administered and serviced nor Sellers procedures and practices of approving
or rejecting loan applications violates in any material respect any Law
applicable thereto. Seller and Seller Sub have full power and authority to
hold such loans and have good and valid title to all such loans, free and
clear of any liens (other than liens in the ordinary course of business to the
FHLB or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta), and the principal balance of
each such loan as shown on the books and records of Seller and Seller Sub is
true and correct as of the last date shown thereon. To the Knowledge of
Seller, each such loan is enforceable against the obligor(s) thereunder in
accordance with its terms, in each such case subject to the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception, except for such unenforceability which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. All such loans will continue in full force and effect
immediately after the Effective Time, other than any loans that are paid or
otherwise satisfied in full after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time, except for such failure to be in full force and effect which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to result in
a Seller Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Section 3.23, the term
"loans" includes the documents relating in any way to such loans, including
loan applications, notes or borrowing arrangements (including leases, credit
enhancements, commitments and interest-bearing assets), security agreements,
deeds of trust, appraisals, credit reports, disclosures, titles to
collateral, verifications (including employment verification, deposit
verification, etc.), mortgages, loan agreements, including building and loan
agreements, guarantees, pledge agreements, financing statements, intercreditor
agreements, participation agreements, sureties and insurance policies
(including title insurance policies) and all modifications, waivers and
consents relating to any of the foregoing. The electronic data files delivered
by Seller to Acquiror with respect to all outstanding Seller loans are true,
correct and complete in all material respects as of the date provided to or
made available to Acquiror.

(b) Neither Seller nor Seller Sub is a party to any agreement or arrangement
with (or otherwise obligated to) any third party which obligates Seller or
Seller Sub, as applicable, to repurchase from such third party any loan or
other asset of Seller or Seller Sub, as applicable, unless there is a
material breach of a representation or covenant by Seller or Seller Sub, as
applicable. None of the agreements pursuant to which Seller has sold loans or
pools of loans or participations in loans or pools of loans contains any
obligation to repurchase such loans or interests therein or to pursue any
other form of recourse against Seller solely on account of a payment default
by the obligor(s) of such loans. _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(b)_  sets
forth all claims made or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, for
repurchases of home mortgage loans sold to third parties.

(c) Since January 1, 2013, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
foreclosed upon, or taken a deed or title to, any real estate (other than
single-family residential properties) without complying in all material
respects 

 



22  with all applicable FDIC environmental due diligence standards (including
FDIC Bulletin FIL-14-93, and update FIL-98-2006) or foreclosed upon, or taken
a deed or title to, any such real estate if the environmental assessment
indicates the liabilities under Environmental Laws are likely in excess of the
assets value.

(d) Since January 1, 2013, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
acquired or disposed of any pool of Seller loans, other than related to its
mortgage purchase business in the ordinary course of business.

 

(e) Since January 1, 2013, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has been
subject to any fine, suspension, settlement or other contract or other
administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in any loan purchase
commitment from, any Governmental Entity relating to the origination, sale or
servicing of mortgage or consumer loans.

 

(f) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(f)_ sets forth a list of (i) each Seller
loan that as of September 30, 2016 had an outstanding balance and/or unfunded
commitment of $100,000 or more and that as of such date (A) was contractually
past due 60 days or more in the payment of principal and/or interest or was in
default of any other material provision, (B) was on non-accrual status, (C)
was classified as "substandard," "doubtful" "loss," "classified,"
"criticized," "impaired" or "special mention" (or words of similar import) by
Seller Sub or any Governmental Entity, (D) where the interest rate terms have
been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the
agreement under which the Seller loan was originally created due to
concerns regarding the borrowers ability to pay in accordance with such
initial terms, (E) where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection
therewith, (F) which is required to be accounted for as a troubled debt
restructuring in accordance with Accounting Standards Topic 310-40 or (G)
which otherwise there exists a reasonable doubt regarding the collectability
of all principal and interest on a timely basis; and (ii) each asset of Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries that as of September 30, 2016 was classified as
"other real estate owned," "other repossessed assets" or as an asset to
satisfy Seller loans, and the book value thereof as of such date. For each
Seller loan identified in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence,
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.23(f)_ sets forth the outstanding balance,
including accrued and unpaid interest and late fees, on each such loan and the
identity of the borrower thereunder as of September 30, 2016.

3.24 _Investment Securities; BOLI_.

 

(a) Except for securities pledged for reverse repurchase agreements, interest
rate swap, cap and floor contracts or pledged to secure public trust funds,
(i) none of the investments under the heading "Securities available-for-sale,
at fair value" and none of the assets under the heading "Cash and due from
banks" reflected in the audited consolidated balance sheet of Seller as of
December 31, 2015 and (ii) none of such investments or such assets acquired by
Seller and the Subsidiaries since December 31, 2015 is subject to any
restriction, whether contractual or statutory, that impairs the ability of
Seller or any of the Subsidiaries freely to dispose of such investment at any
time. With respect to all repurchase agreements of which Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party, Seller or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, has
a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in or evidence of
ownership in book entry form of the government securities or other collateral
securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral
equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby under such
agreement.

(b) _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.24(b)_ sets forth a true, correct and
complete description of all bank owned life insurance ("BOLI") owned by
Seller, Seller Sub or any of the other Subsidiaries, including the value of
its BOLI. Seller, Seller Sub and its other Subsidiaries have taken all actions
necessary to comply in all material respects with applicable Law in
connection with the purchase of BOLI. The value of such BOLI is and has been
fairly and accurately reflected in all material respects in the most recent
balance sheet included in the financial statements of Seller delivered
pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof, in accordance with GAAP. All BOLI is owned
solely by Seller, Seller Sub or another Subsidiary, and no other person has
any ownership claims with respect to such BOLI or proceeds of insurance
derived therefrom and there is no split dollar or similar benefit under such
BOLI. Neither Seller, Seller Sub nor any of the other Subsidiaries has any
outstanding borrowings secured in whole or part by its BOLI.

 



23 3.25 _Employees; Compensation_.

 

(a) Seller has made available to Acquiror a complete and correct list of the
name, date of birth, hire date, adjusted hire date, position, rate of
compensation and any incentive compensation arrangements, bonuses or
commissions or fringe or other benefits, whether payable in cash or in kind,
of (i) each director and employee of Seller, (ii) each independent
contractor, consultant and agent of Seller who has received or is entitled to
payments and/or benefits of $25,000 or more on an annual basis during fiscal
year 2016 or who is proposed to receive or be entitled to payments and/or
benefits of $25,000 or more on an annual basis during fiscal year 2017, and
(iii) each other person to whom Seller pays or provides, or has an obligation,
agreement (written or unwritten), policy or practice of paying or providing,
retirement, health, welfare or other benefits of any kind or description
whatsoever.

(b) (i) Except to the extent a failure to comply would not, alone or with any
other failure, be reasonably likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
(i) each of Seller and the Subsidiaries is and has been in compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, and wages and hours, including any Law relating to
discrimination, fair labor standards and occupational health and safety,
wrongful discharge or violation of the personal rights of employees, former
employees or prospective employees; and (ii) neither Seller nor any of the
Subsidiaries is or has engaged in any unfair labor practices. Additionally,
there are no strikes, slowdowns or work stoppages pending or, to the Knowledge
of Seller, threatened with respect to the employees; there is no
representation claim or petition or complaint pending before the National
Labor Relations Board or any state or local labor agency and, to the Knowledge
of Seller, no question concerning representation has been raised
or threatened respecting the employees; to the Knowledge of Seller, no
charges with respect to or relating to Sellers business are pending before
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or Department of Labor, or any
state or local agency responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment
practices, which would reasonably be likely to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect; and to the Knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor any of the
Subsidiaries has any obligations under any federal, state, or local
government contract. No employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is an
undocumented alien, and Seller has obtained a Form I-9 and all ancillary
information required in connection therewith with respect to each
such employee.

(b) Except to the extent that such liability would not, alone or with any
other failure, reasonably be likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect
liability with respect to any misclassification of any person as an
independent contractor rather than a "common law employee" or with respect to
any person leased from another employer.

(c) Except to the extent a failure to comply would not, alone or with any
other failure, reasonably be likely to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect,
Seller has complied (or will comply) prior to the Effective Time with all
obligations existing on or before the Effective Time imposed by the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN Act") and any applicable
similar state or local law, including, but not limited to, providing all
notices required thereunder.

 

3.26 _Regulatory Matters_. Neither Seller nor any of the Subsidiaries has
taken or agreed to take any action which could reasonably be expected to
materially impede or delay receipt of any unqualified consents of regulatory
authorities referred to in Section 5.7 or result in failure of the condition
in Section 7.1(c). No Seller Common Stock has been or will be acquired
by Seller Sub prior to and in connection with the Mergers.

3.27 _Intellectual Property_.

and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is

jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes

individually or in the aggregate, would not have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect. The term "Acquiror Material Adverse Effect" shall mean any change,

(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub, taken individually or as a whole, other than, as to subpart (ii), (A)
effects resulting from the impact of any actions taken by Acquiror or any of
its subsidiaries with the prior written consent of Seller or required

thereof; (H) any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declared or undeclared
acts of war or terrorism; or (I) the impact of the announcement of this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , that as to each of clauses (B), (C), (E), (F) or (H), such
change, state of facts, circumstance, event or development does not have a
disproportionate effect on Acquiror or Acquiror Sub as compared to other
financial institutions or their holding companies. Acquiror is registered as a
bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.

of the properties and assets owned

such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not have an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each of Acquirors subsidiaries other than Acquiror Sub is duly
incorporated or duly organized, as applicable, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each
of such subsidiaries has the requisite corporate, limited liability company or
trust power and authority, as applicable, to own or lease all of its

September 30, 2016 in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice (none of which arises from breach of any contract or agreement,
breach of warranty, tort, infringement, violation of any applicable Law or any
litigation or other proceeding or is otherwise a "loss contingency" within the
meaning of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450, Contingencies),

absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or to become due,
that is material to the business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition
(financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub, taken individually or as a whole.

 

(c) Since December 31, 2013, (i) neither Acquiror nor any of its subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of it or any of its subsidiaries has received or

(d) Acquiror and Acquiror Sub have maintained a system of "internal controls
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) under 1934 Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external

accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of

the 1934 Act) effective for ensuring that information Acquiror is required to
disclose in reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the

recent evaluation, in the Acquiror SEC Documents and to its outside auditors
and the audit committee of the Acquirors board of directors (x) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Acquirors internal control over financial
reporting.

 

4.5 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in any
publicly available report, schedule, form or other document filed with the

party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Acquiror,
threatened, legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims,
actions or governmental investigations of any nature against Acquiror or any
of its subsidiaries other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary
course of business, which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. Neither Acquiror nor any of its
subsidiaries is a party to any judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
which, individually or in the aggregate, would have an Acquiror Material

Acquiror and its subsidiaries has duly paid all income Taxes and all other
material Taxes that were due and payable other than Taxes which (i) are being

accordance with GAAP. Except as set forth in _Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
4.7(a)_ , no Tax Return filed by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is under
examination by any Governmental Entity or is the subject of any administrative
or judicial proceeding, and no written notice of assessment, proposed
assessment or unpaid Tax deficiency has been received by or asserted against
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity that has not
been resolved. No written claim has been made by any Governmental Entity in
any jurisdiction where Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that it is, or may be, subject to Tax in that jurisdiction that has
not been resolved. The federal income Tax Returns of Acquiror and the
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods ended on or prior to December 31, 2012
are closed to examination due to the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, and the Mississippi franchise Tax Returns of Acquiror and the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, respectively, for all taxable periods ended on or
prior to December 31, 2012 are closed to examination due to the expiration of
the statute of limitations. Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period for the assessment or
collection of any Tax that remains in effect.

(b) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has requested any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return which Tax Return has
not since been filed; (ii) is a party to any written or unwritten agreement,
arrangement or understanding providing for the allocation or sharing of, or
indemnification with respect to, Taxes, which agreement, arrangement or
understanding required Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries to make payments
after January 1, 2017 or could require Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries to
make any payments after the Effective Time (other than (x) such an agreement
or arrangement exclusively between or among the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries
and (y) customary commercial agreements not primarily related to Taxes that
contain agreements or arrangements relating to the apportionment, sharing,
assignment or allocation of Taxes, such as leases with Tax escalation
provisions); (iii) has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the
Code within the past five years; or (iv) has ever engaged in any "listed
transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(2).

or any of its subsidiaries, except for liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable.

(d) Acquiror and its subsidiaries have disclosed on their federal income Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning
of Section 6662 of the Code.

 



31 (e) Acquiror is not aware of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Parent Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

4.8  _Securities Documents and Regulatory Reports_.

(a) Since January 1, 2014, Acquiror has filed or furnished on a timely
basis with the Commission all final registration statements, prospectuses,

promulgated by the Commission (all such filed or furnished documents since

connection therewith, except where the failure to file (or furnish,
as applicable) such monthly, quarterly and annual reports, forms,
correspondence, registrations and statements, individually or in the
aggregate, is not reasonably likely to have an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect. As of their filing date, each such report or other filing did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. To the extent not prohibited by Law, Acquiror has
delivered or made available to Seller accurate and complete copies of such
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements. Other than its

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Seller shall, and shall cause its
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative retained by Seller or any of its affiliates (each, a
"Seller Representative")) to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place prior to the
date hereof with any persons or that may be ongoing with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Upon request by Acquiror, Seller shall request the
return and destruction of all confidential information provided to any such
person. In addition, Seller shall not release any third party from, or waive
any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreements to which it is
a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Except as otherwise
provided below, from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time,
Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any Seller Representative
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate, or
knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information
or assistance), or take any other action designed to solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions, negotiations or other
communications regarding any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) provide any
confidential or nonpublic information or data to any person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, but
subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 5.3, Sellers board
of directors may, prior to the Special Meeting (but not after), take any of
the actions described in Section 5.3(ii) or (iii) in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.3) if and only to the extent that (x) Sellers board
of directors concludes in good faith that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; (y) Sellers board
of directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor (as to financial matters), that failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and (z) prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to this proviso, Seller shall have provided
both notice to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub of its intention to provide such
information to the third party as well as to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub (if
not previously provided to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub), and Seller shall have
entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on customary
terms and conditions (including customary non-disclosure, confidentiality,
standstill and non-solicitation and no-hire provisions and not including any
provisions giving such person any exclusive right to negotiate with Seller or
prohibiting disclosure to Acquiror of the terms and conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal). Seller agrees that it will take the necessary
steps to inform the Seller Representatives of the obligations undertaken in
this Section 5.3.

 



40 For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Acquisition Proposal" means
any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or
notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do
any of the foregoing from any person relating to any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes a substantial portion
of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets of Seller, (ii) direct
or indirect acquisition or purchase of any class of equity securities
representing 20% or more of the voting power of any class of equity
securities of Seller or 20% or more of the consolidated assets of Seller,
(iii) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 20% or more of the voting power of any class of
equity securities of Seller, or (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving Seller, in each case other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that Sellers board of
directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the person
making such Acquisition Proposal (including any applicable termination fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation) that Sellers
board of directors deems relevant as well as the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Acquiror), is (i) more
favorable to the stockholders of Seller from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) reasonably capable
of being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ that, for purposes of
this definition of Superior Proposal, the term Acquisition Proposal shall have
the meaning assigned to such term in the paragraph immediately above except
that the reference to "20% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a reference to "50% or more."

 

(b) Seller shall notify Acquiror as promptly as practicable (and in no event
more than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any request
for nonpublic information relating to Seller or any Subsidiary that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from
any person seeking to have discussions, negotiations or other
communications relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
be made orally and confirmed in writing and shall indicate the identity of the
person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions of any inquiries, requests, proposals or offers
(including a copy of the most recent proposed acquisition agreement, if any),
except to the extent that such information both constitutes confidential
information of the third party making such Acquisition Proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement and is not related to the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. Seller agrees that it shall keep
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussions (including any amendments or modifications to such
proposal, offer or request).

 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3, and after compliance
with this Agreement, neither the board of directors of Seller nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify (or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify), in a manner
adverse in any respect to the interests of Acquiror, the Seller
Recommendation or take any action or make any statement in connection with
the Special Meeting inconsistent with such approval or the Seller
Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend (or propose publicly to approve or
recommend) any Acquisition Proposal (either (i) or (ii), a "Change in the
Seller Recommendation"). Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.3,
and after compliance with this Agreement, Seller shall not, and Sellers board
of directors or any committee thereof shall not cause Seller to, enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.3(a) and in compliance
with the terms thereof) relating to any Acquisition Transaction (each, a
"Seller Acquisition Agreement"). For purposes of this Agreement, a Change in
the Seller Recommendation shall include any failure by Sellers board of
directors to recommend against an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Seller
Stockholder Approval, the board of directors of Seller (including any
committee thereof) may effect a Change in the Seller Recommendation (and, in
the event that the board of directors of Seller determines such Acquisition
Proposal to be a Superior Proposal in accordance with 

 



41  this Section 5.3, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VII hereof in
order to concurrently enter into a Seller Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal), if the board of directors of Seller determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors (as to financial matters), that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may not take any such actions unless (y)
Seller shall have complied in all respects with this Section 5.3 and Section
5.8 and (z):

 



     | (i) | Sellers board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor (as to
financial matters), that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal
and such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account all adjustments
to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Acquiror and Acquiror
Sub under this Section 5.3(c); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Seller has given each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub at least
five Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any
such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such
Superior Proposal)) and has contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the person making such
Superior Proposal;  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Before effecting such Change in the Seller Recommendation,
Seller has negotiated, and has caused Seller Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Acquiror and Acquiror Sub during such notice period, to the
extent Acquiror and Acquiror Sub wish to negotiate, to enable Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement that obviate
the need of Sellers board of directors to make a Change in the Seller
Recommendation, including in the case of a Superior Proposal, by proposing
such terms so as to make such Superior Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal;
and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Sellers board of directors, following the end of such five
Business Day period again determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and with its financial advisor (as to
financial matters) and having considered in good faith any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Acquiror and any other information
provided by Acquiror, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make a Change in the
Seller Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 

If during such five Business Day period there are any material modifications
to the financial terms (including any modifications to the form, amount or
timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of any
Superior Proposal, Seller shall, in each case, deliver to Acquiror and
Acquiror Sub as reasonably necessary a new written notice, the notice period
shall have recommenced (except that the length of the new notice period shall
be reduced to the greater of the number of days remaining in the original
five-day notice period or three Business Days) and Seller shall be required to
comply with its obligations under this Section 5.3(c) with respect to such
new written notice. During the applicable notice period, Seller shall not
terminate this Agreement unless Seller receives written notice from Acquiror
that it does not intend to enter into negotiations with Seller to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement to match or better a Superior
Proposal.

(d) Subject to Section 7.1(e) (and in that case, only if Seller shall have
complied with its obligations under this Section 5.3 and Section 5.8), nothing
in this Section 5.3 shall permit Seller to terminate this Agreement or affect
any other obligation of Seller under this Agreement. Unless this Agreement
has been terminated, Seller shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders
any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit Seller from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that
compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect
that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of
this Agreement.

 



42 5.4 _Negative Covenants of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub_. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, or as set forth on _Acquiror Disclosure Schedule
5.4_ , during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, each of Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and their Subsidiaries and their
respective boards of directors shall not:

(a) other than in connection with this Agreement, and except as would not have
an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect, fail to conduct its business in the
ordinary and usual course consistent with past practices and prudent banking
practice, or fail to maintain and preserve intact its business organization,
properties, leases, employees and advantageous business relationships
and retain the services of its officers and key employees;

(b) knowingly take, or fail to take, any action which would be reasonably
expected to adversely affect or delay the ability of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub
to perform their respective covenants and agreements on a timely basis under
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

 

(c) knowingly take, or fail to take, any action that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of its representations and warranties contained in
Article IV not being true and correct in any material respect at the Effective
Time;

(d) knowingly take, or fail to take, any action which would be reasonably
expected to adversely affect or delay the ability of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub
to obtain any necessary approvals, consents or waivers of any Governmental
Entity required for the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
reasonably be expected to result in any such approvals, consents or waivers
containing any condition or restriction that would materially impair the value
of the transaction to Acquiror;

 

(e) agree to, or make any commitment to, take, or adopt any resolutions of
board of directors of Acquiror or Acquiror Sub in support of, any of the
actions prohibited by this Section 5.4;

(f) change any provision of Acquirors articles of incorporation in a way
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect (i) Acquirors ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) the rights of a holder
of Acquiror Common Stock; or

 

(g) other than changes required by GAAP as concurred in by Acquirors
independent accountants, (A) make any material change in its accounting
methods or practices or systems of internal accounting controls (or the manner
in which liabilities are accrued), (B) revalue in any material respect any of
its assets, including writing-off notes or accounts receivable or (C)
materially change any of its methods of reporting income and deductions for
federal income tax purposes, except as required by changes in Law .

 

5.5 _Current Information_. During the period from the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the parties will cause one or more of each of their
designated representatives to confer on a monthly or more frequent basis with
representatives of the other party regarding each of its business, operations,
assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations
or matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) in such
conferences with representatives of Acquiror the designated representative(s)
of Seller and Seller Sub shall provide updates with respect to loan charge-
offs and sales of other real estate owned since the last conference, (ii)
within 10 days after the end of each calendar month, Seller shall provide
Acquiror with (A) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the end of
such month, together with unaudited consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flows for the month and year-to-date period,
which unaudited consolidated financial statements will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP and will fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial position of Seller at the respective dates thereof and the results
of Sellers operations and cash flows for the periods indicated
therein, subject to the omission of footnotes and normal and year-end audit
adjustments as permitted by GAAP, none of which adjustments, to the extent
they relate to Sellers or Seller Subs capital ratios, will be material, and
(B) a schedule of loans charged-off during such month and other real estate
owned sold during such month. Within 30 days after

 



43  the end of each fiscal quarter, Seller shall provide Acquiror with a copy of
the FDIC Call Report filed with the FDIC; in addition, subject to applicable
Laws (including relating to the exchange of information), within five
Business Days after filing Seller shall provide Acquiror a copy of all
reports, forms, correspondence, registrations and statements, together with
any amendments thereto, that Seller or Seller Sub files during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, the MCB, the FDIC, the FRB and
any other federal or state Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Seller
and/or Seller Sub.

 

5.6 _Access to Properties and Records; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each of the parties shall permit the other party and its representatives
reasonable access to their properties and shall disclose and make available
to the other all books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities of the other party, including, but not
limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax
records, minute books of directors and stockholders meetings,
organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities in which the other party may have an
interest, except for such documents that such partys board of directors has
been advised by its counsel that such disclosure, production or distribution
may violate a confidentiality obligation, fiduciary duty, any Law or
regulation, or may result in a waiver of such partys attorney-client
privilege. Neither party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of any customer or would contravene any Law, order or judgment. The
parties will use their reasonable best efforts to obtain waivers of any such
restriction and in any event make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. The parties shall make their respective executive officers
available to confer with the other partys representatives, provided that such
access shall be reasonably related to the transactions contemplated hereby
and not unduly interfere with normal operations.

(b) All information furnished previously by the parties or any of their
respective subsidiaries, or hereafter furnished prior to the Effective Time,
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or pursuant
hereto shall be treated as the sole property of the party furnishing the
information until consummation of the Mergers and, if the Mergers shall not
occur, the party receiving the information shall (i) at the request of the
party which furnished such information, either return to the party
which furnished such information or destroy all documents or other materials
containing, reflecting or referring to such information; _provided_ , that the
party receiving the information shall not be required to delete or erase such
information from its servers; (ii) use its best efforts to keep confidential
all such information; (iii) use such information only for the purpose of
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) not
directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or commercial
purposes. The obligations of the parties to keep such information confidential
shall continue for three years (except for any confidential customer
information, which shall be kept confidential indefinitely) from the date the
Mergers are abandoned but shall not apply to (i) any information which (A) was
already in the possession of the party receiving the information prior to the
disclosure thereof to it by the party furnishing the information; (B) was
then generally known to the public; (C) became known to the public through no
fault of the party receiving the information; or (D) was disclosed to the
party receiving the information by a third-party not known by the receiving
party to be bound by an obligation of confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures
pursuant to Law or in accordance with an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or any other Governmental Entity with authority to
compel disclosure.

5.7 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, and assist and cooperate with the
other parties in taking, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to comply promptly with all legal requirements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including obtaining any third-party consent
or waiver that may be required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (including actions

 



44  required in order to effect the Subsidiary Merger simultaneously with the
Effective Time and to continue any contract or agreement of Seller or Seller
Sub following Closing or to avoid any penalty or other fee under such
contracts and agreements, in each case arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii) obtain (and assist and cooperate
with the other parties in obtaining) any permit, consent, waiver, approval
and authorization of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity that is
required or advisable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Mergers. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each
other and prepare and file, as promptly as possible after the date hereof,
all necessary documentation, and effect all applications, notices, petitions
and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents,
waivers, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) Each of the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such
consents and approvals and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have
been contested by any Governmental Entity or any third party by formal
proceeding. It is understood that, if any such contest is brought by formal
proceeding, Acquiror and Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, answer and
defend such contest or otherwise pursue the Mergers and the transactions
contemplated hereby over such objection. Notwithstanding anything set forth
in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall a party be required, and
Seller and Seller Sub shall not be permitted (without Acquirors written
consent in its sole discretion), to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
the foregoing permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations, that
would have, or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
determination by a Governmental Entity that the Subsidiary Merger may not be
consummated as contemplated herein, including simultaneously with the
Effective Time); _provided_ , that, if requested by Acquiror, then Seller and
Seller Sub will take or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such
condition or restriction, so long as such action, commitment, agreement,
condition or restriction is binding on Seller and Seller Sub only in the event
the Closing occurs.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Acquiror and Seller shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning Acquiror, Seller, Acquiror Sub and Seller Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers and
stockholders, as applicable, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Acquiror, Seller, Acquiror Sub and Seller Sub to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws (including those relating to the exchange of
information), Seller and Acquiror shall keep each other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject
to applicable Laws, the parties shall (i) promptly furnish each other with
copies of notices or other communications received by the other party (or
written summaries of communications received orally), from any third party or
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and accept the reasonable comments of the other party in connection
with, any proposed communication to, including any filings with or other
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity, and (iii) consider in
good faith the other partys views with respect to, and confer in good faith
with the other party to resolve, any disagreement as to strategy with respect
to any communication by the other party with any Governmental Entity or third
party relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, participate in any
meeting or substantive discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with Acquiror in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by applicable Laws, gives Acquiror the opportunity to attend and participate.
Any such disclosures or rights to participate may be made on an outside
counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Laws.

 



45 5.8 _Preparation of Registration Statement; Stockholder Approval_.

 

(a) Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Acquiror in order for Acquiror to
prepare and file with the Commission as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof a proxy statement/prospectus (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") to
be mailed to the stockholders of Seller related to the Special Meeting and to
be part of the Registration Statement to be filed by Acquiror with the
Commission pursuant to the 1933 Act with respect to the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Parent Merger. The parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable after its filing.
The Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any amendment thereto, shall include,
subject to Section 5.3, the Seller Recommendation. Acquiror shall notify
Seller promptly of the receipt of any comments from the Commission or its
staff and of any request by the Commission or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement or
for additional information and shall supply Seller with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and
the Commission or its staff, on the other hand, with respect thereto. If, at
any time prior to the Special Meeting, any event occurs with respect to any
party hereto, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied
by a party for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement,
such party shall promptly notify the other party of such event, and cooperate
in the prompt filing with the Commission of any necessary amendment or
supplement thereto and, to the extent required by applicable Laws, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the
stockholders of Seller. Acquiror will advise Seller promptly after it receives
notice thereof of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of the
Acquiror Common Stock issuable in connection with the Parent Merger for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the Commission for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information. When the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto shall become effective, and at all times subsequent to such
effectiveness, up to and including the Effective Time, such Registration
Statement and all amendments or supplements thereto, with respect to
all information set forth therein furnished or to be furnished by Acquiror
and Acquiror Sub relating to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub and by Seller and
Seller Sub relating to Seller and or any of Sellers Subsidiaries, (i) will
comply in all material respects with the provisions of the 1933 Act and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and (ii) will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained
therein not misleading. Acquiror also agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any necessary state securities Law or "blue sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Seller shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.3 and this Section
5.8, (i) take all steps (including cooperating with Acquiror in the
distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (including any
adjournments, the "Special Meeting") as soon as reasonably practicable for
the purposes of securing the Seller Stockholder Approval, (ii) recommend to
its stockholders the approval of this Agreement, including the Parent Merger,
and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Seller Recommendation"), and
(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable,
the Seller Stockholder Approval. Promptly following approval of this Agreement
by the stockholders of Seller, Seller, as the sole stockholder of Seller Sub,
and Acquiror, as the sole stockholder of Acquiror Sub, each in such capacity,
will approve the Subsidiary Merger Document, whether at a meeting or by
written consent.

 

5.9 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to Sections 5.1 and
5.4 of this Agreement, each of Seller and Acquiror shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Mergers and, subject to
the conditions set forth in Article VI, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to

 



46  obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Seller or Acquiror or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.10 _Disclosure Supplements_. Between the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, each party will supplement or amend its respective Disclosure
Schedules delivered pursuant hereto with respect to any matter hereafter
arising which, if existing, occurring or known as of the date hereof, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such Schedules or which
is necessary to correct any information in such Schedules which has been
rendered inaccurate thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the inclusion of
any information in any such amendment or supplement not included in the
original Disclosure Schedules which is necessary to correct any material
inaccuracy in such Schedules shall not limit or impair any right which a party
may have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) due to failure
to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.3(a), as
the case may be.

5.11 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto
shall approve in advance the substance, and cooperate with each other in the
development and distribution, of all news releases and other public
disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as may be otherwise required by Law and as to
which the parties releasing such information have used their reasonable
efforts to discuss with the other parties in advance.

 

5.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Acquiror shall use all reasonable best efforts
to cause the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in the Parent
Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject
to official notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable, and in any event
before the Closing Date.

 

5.13 _Certain Post-Merger Agreements_.

 

The parties hereto agree to the following arrangements following the Effective
Time:

 



     | _(a)_  | _Employee Benefit Plans_. 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.13, following
the Effective Time, Acquiror, in its discretion, will either maintain existing
Seller Plans or shall offer coverage under applicable Acquiror Plans
to employees of Seller or any of the Subsidiaries who become employed by
Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof (as the case may
be, "Employer") immediately following the Effective Time
("Transferred Employees"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror will honor
the terms of Seller Plans to the extent of benefits accrued as of the
Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Following the Effective Time, Acquiror will provide
continuation coverage under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA
and other applicable Law to all "qualified beneficiaries" (within the meaning
of Code Section 4980(g)) who were entitled to such coverage under Sellers or
any Subsidiarys group health plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | Acquiror shall provide credit to any Transferred Employee
for periods of service with Seller and its Subsidiaries under the Acquiror
Plans for eligibility and vesting purposes, and solely for purposes of
seniority-based benefits, such as vacation accrual and severance, accrual
purposes, to the same extent as provided under the corresponding Seller Plans,
provided that such service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

Acquiror and Acquiror Sub agree that, to the extent waived, satisfied or
inapplicable to any Transferred Employee under the terms of any group health,
group term life insurance or long-term disability plan maintained by Seller or
any of the Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, any preexisting condition or
similar limitation or exclusion contained in an Employers group health,
long-term 

---|---|--- 
 



47 to Transferred Employees or their covered dependents who are covered under
similar plans maintained by Seller or any of the Subsidiaries at the
Effective Time and who then change coverage to the Employers group health,
group term life insurance or long-term disability plan at the time such
Transferred Employees are first given the option to enroll.  
---|--- 



     | (v) | To the extent practicable, Transferred Employees shall be
given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding Seller Plan during the
same period during which such Transferred Employees commence participation in
any similar Acquiror Plans for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments
and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Acquiror Plans. Acquiror agrees to take
such reasonable measures as may be appropriate to mitigate the adverse
consequences of a short plan year prior to transition to Acquiror Plans, such
as extending the terms of the applicable Seller Plan to coincide with the plan
year of the applicable Acquiror Plan.  
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Subject to Acquirors or any of its subsidiaries right to
terminate a Transferred Employee at any time after the Closing Date, the
Transferred Employees shall, for a period of at least twelve months
following the Closing Date, receive no less favorable annual salary, hourly
wages, annual bonus opportunities and equity incentives than similarly-
situated employees of Acquiror or its subsidiaries. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vii) | Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall have adopted
resolutions of the Sellers board of directors to terminate its tax-qualified
cash or deferred arrangement described in _Seller Disclosure Schedule
3.8(a)_, effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date (contingent upon
the Closing). Employer shall cause an Acquiror Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code to accept rollovers by Transferred Employees from
any similar Sellers Plan, including rollovers of any plan loans in such
accounts. 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, after
the Effective Time, nothing contained herein shall restrict the ability of the
Employer to amend, modify, terminate or replace any Seller Plan, in its
discretion, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Seller Plan. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | No provision in this Agreement shall amend or modify or be
deemed to modify or amend any Seller Plan or any similar plan, policy,
arrangement or agreement maintained by Acquiror. Nothing contained herein
shall be deemed a guarantee of employment for any Transferred Employee, shall
restrict the right of Acquiror, Acquiror Sub or affiliate thereof to terminate
the employment of any Transferred Employee or constitute a guarantee of any
type or amount of compensation or benefits (except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement). 
---|---|--- 

(b) _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_. Acquiror shall indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of Seller
(determined as of the Effective Time) and any of the Subsidiaries (determined
as of the effective time of the Subsidiary Merger) and their heirs, personal
representatives and estates (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against,
and shall promptly upon request advance or reimburse, any and all costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, interest, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement
(collectively, "Costs") as they are incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, arbitrative or investigative ("Proceeding"),
whether or not the Indemnified Party is a party to such Proceeding, based upon
or arising from the Indemnified Partys acts or omissions as an officer or
director of Seller and/or any of the Subsidiaries, whether threatened,
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (collectively,
"Claims"), to the same extent as the Indemnified Parties would have been
indemnified under the certificate of incorporation and/or bylaws of Seller or
any Subsidiary as such documents were in effect on the date of this Agreement
as if the Indemnified Parties were officers or directors of Seller or any
Subsidiary at all relevant times, except that no indemnity shall be provided
by Acquiror hereunder with respect to any Claim arising on account of an
Indemnified Partys service as an officer or director of another for-profit
entity; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom any expenses are
advanced must provide an undertaking (in a reasonable and

 



48  customary form) to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. This indemnity
shall be provided for six years following the Effective Time; or if there
shall be any Proceeding pending or threatened on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, such indemnity shall continue in full force and effect until
such pending or threatened Proceeding is finally resolved.

 

The rights to indemnification granted by this Section 5.13(b) are subject to
the following limitations: (i) a director or officer of Seller or any of the
Subsidiaries (determined as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
Effective Time) who would otherwise be a member of the Indemnified Parties
under this Section 5.13(b) shall not be entitled to the benefits
hereof unless such director or officer has executed a Joinder Agreement in
the form of _Schedule 5.13(b)_ hereto; and (ii) amounts otherwise required to
be paid by Acquiror to the Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section
5.13(b) shall be reduced by any amounts that such Indemnified Parties recover
from any third party.

(c) _Insurance_. Seller shall obtain on or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies)
covering each present and former director and officer of Seller and any of the
Subsidiaries as set forth in Section 5.13(b) at no cost to the beneficiaries
thereof with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred
prior to the Effective Time, in the same coverage amount as in effect under
Sellers directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies) (both
primary and excess) immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ , that
if the aggregate premium Seller would be required to pay for such "tail"
policy(ies) is in excess of 300% of the premium for such coverage set forth
in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ , then Seller shall purchase as much
coverage as is reasonably practicable for 300% of the premium set forth in
_Seller Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ , unless otherwise agreed in advance in
writing by Acquiror. Such policy shall survive the Mergers.

(d) _Subsequent Events_. In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all its properties and assets to any entity, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successor and assign of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set
forth in Sections 5.13(b) and (c). The provisions of Sections 5.13(b) and (c)
shall survive consummation of the Mergers and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her legal representatives. This Section 5.13 may not be
amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without the prior
written consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

 

5.14 _Takeover Laws; No Rights Triggered_. If any Takeover Law may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each
of the parties and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.15 _Adoption of Accounting Policies_. As soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Closing set forth in Article
VI and at such time as consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement seems reasonably assured and in any event prior to the Effective
Time (unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII), Seller
and Seller Sub shall take any and all necessary or appropriate actions to
adopt all Acquiror accounting procedures and policies (including those
policies pertaining to charged-off and non-accrual assets); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such action taken by Seller or Seller Sub at the request
of Acquiror pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be, or be deemed to
cause, a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller or Seller Sub
herein.

 

5.16 _Operating Functions_. Seller and Seller Sub shall cooperate with
Acquiror and Acquiror Sub in connection with planning for the efficient and
orderly combination of the parties and the operation of the Subsidiary
Surviving

 



49  Bank after the Subsidiary Merger, and in preparing for the consolidation of
appropriate operating functions to be effective on the Closing Date or such
later date as Acquiror may decide. Seller shall take, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its data processing consultants and software
providers to take, any action Acquiror may reasonably request prior to the
Effective Time to facilitate the combination of the operations of Seller Sub
with Acquiror Sub. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall provide office
space and support services (and other reasonably requested support and
assistance) in connection with the foregoing, and senior officers of Seller
and Acquiror shall meet from time to time as Seller or Acquiror may
reasonably request, to review the financial and operational affairs of Seller
and Seller Sub, and Seller shall give due consideration to Acquirors input on
such matters, with the understanding that, notwithstanding any other
provision contained in this Agreement, (i) neither Acquiror nor Acquiror Sub
shall under any circumstance be permitted to exercise control of Seller,
Seller Sub or any of Sellers other Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be under any obligation
to act in a manner that could reasonably be deemed to constitute anti-
competitive behavior under federal or state antitrust laws and (iii) neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any material
obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

5.17 _Certain Agreements_. As promptly as practicable after the date hereof
(but no later than ten days following the date of this Agreement), Seller and
Seller Sub shall have each director of Seller and Seller Sub who is not an
employee of Seller or Seller Sub, respectively, execute a Voting and Non-
Competition Agreement in substantially the form of _Schedule 5.17-A_  hereto
and have each executive officer of Seller and Seller Sub who is also a
director of Seller or Seller Sub, respectively, execute a Voting Agreement in
substantially the form of _Schedule 5.17-B_ hereto. In addition, as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof (but no later than ten days following
the date of this Agreement), Seller and Seller Sub shall cause each of
Columbia Equity Partners and Presidio Investors, LLC to executing a Voting
Agreement containing substantially the same obligations as those contained in
the Voting Agreement attached as _Schedule 5.17-B_ hereto.

5.18 _Hold Harmless_. Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless Seller,
Seller Sub, each of the directors and officers and each person, if any, who
controls Seller or Seller Sub within the meaning of the 1933 Act against any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint, several and solidary, to which
they or any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or in
any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising out of or based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and
will pay or promptly reimburse such person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror
shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability (or actions in respect thereof) arises out of or is based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in the Registration Statement or any such amendment or
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to
Acquiror by Seller or Seller Sub for use therein. Promptly after receipt by
an indemnified party hereunder of notice of the commencement of any action,
such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against Acquiror under this Section 5.18, notify Acquiror in writing of the
commencement thereof. In case any such action shall be brought against any
indemnified party and it shall notify Acquiror of the commencement thereof,
Acquiror shall be entitled to participate therein; and to the extent that
it shall wish to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such
indemnified party, and, after notice from Acquiror to such indemnified party
of its election to so assume the defense thereof, Acquiror shall not be liable
to such indemnified party under this Section 5.18 for any legal expenses of
other counsel or of any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party; _provided_ , that, if Acquiror elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the indemnified parties advises that there are
substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between Acquiror and the
indemnified parties, the indemnified parties may retain one counsel
satisfactory to them, and Acquiror shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for such indemnified parties promptly as statements therefor
are received.

 



50 5.19 _Stockholder Litigation_. Seller shall provide Acquiror the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Seller and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement throughout the course of any such litigation, and Acquiror
shall in good faith consider the recommendations by Seller regarding such
litigation. Seller shall not settle any stockholder litigation without
Acquirors prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).

 

5.20 _Severance_. An employee of Seller or any Subsidiary (other than any
employee who is party to an employment agreement, severance agreement or
change-in-control agreement that provides for severance benefits) who has been
employed by Seller or any Subsidiary for at least six months whose employment
is terminated involuntarily other than for "cause," in connection with, or
within six months after, the consummation of the Mergers shall be entitled to
receive severance payments from Acquiror equal in amount to two weeks base
pay (with such amount to be calculated based upon such employees base pay as
of termination of employment or, if greater, the Effective Time) for each full
year (prorated for any partial year) such employee was employed by Seller or
any Subsidiary or any successor or predecessor thereto, subject to a minimum
of four weeks severance and a maximum of 16 weeks severance, and,
_provided_ _further_ , that, as a condition to any payment, such terminated
employee shall have entered into a release of claims against the Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Bank, Seller, the Subsidiaries and their
respective affiliates in a form mutually agreed to by Acquiror and Seller and
such release shall have become irrevocable no later than 60 days after
termination of the employees employment. For purposes of this Section 5.20,
"cause" shall mean termination because of the employees material personal
dishonesty in the course and scope of his or her employment, willful
misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional
failure to perform stated duties or willful violation of any law, rule, or
regulation (other than traffic violations or similar violations), "base pay"
shall mean an employees annual salary or annual compensation computed on an
hourly basis, excluding bonuses, commissions, perquisites, benefits or similar
payments, and "year of credited service" shall mean each full 12-month period
of service from the date of hire. Severance shall be paid in a lump-sum on
the date the release becomes irrevocable unless required to be paid on a
subsequent date pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

5.21 _Seller Indebtedness_. Acquiror will execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or
prior to the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures and other
instruments required for the due assumption of Sellers 6.50% Fixed to
Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due July 1, 2026.

 

5.22 _Officer Agreements_.

 

Both Seller and Acquiror shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary
to unilaterally terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, each of the
Employment Agreements between Seller and the respective executives set forth
in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.22_ (collectively the "Existing Officer
Agreements") in exchange for a cash payment at Closing in a single lump sum
in the amount set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.22_ opposite the
executives name (net of applicable tax withholdings). The termination and
liquidation of the Existing Officer Agreements shall be made consistent with
the provisions of Section 409A of the Code for termination and liquidation of
a plan in connection with a change in control event under Section 409A of the
Code, so as to avoid any additional tax, interest or penalties in
connection with the termination and liquidation of the Existing Officer
Agreements. Effective as of the Closing Date, (i) Acquiror Sub and Curtis J.
Gabardi, shall enter into an employment agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Schedule 5.22(i)_ (the "Gabardi Agreement") and (ii) the
executives set forth in _Seller Disclosure Schedule 5.22_ shall execute and
deliver termination agreements, substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Schedule 5.22(ii)_.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER, ETC.

 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Mergers may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding approval
thereof by the stockholders of Seller:

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Seller and Acquiror;

 

(b) by either Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) or Seller (on
behalf of itself and Seller Sub):

 

(i) (A) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or prior to December
31, 2017 (the "Outside Date") unless approval by a Governmental Entity
pursuant to Section 6.1(a) is pending and has not been finally resolved or any
stockholder litigation referenced in Section 5.19 has not been resolved (by
dismissal, settlement or otherwise), in which event such date shall be
automatically extended to March 31, 2018; or (B) if a vote of the stockholders
of Seller is taken and Seller fails to obtain the Seller Stockholder Approval;
_provided_ , that, neither party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) if the failure of such occurrence
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe its agreements set forth herein to be performed or
observed by such party at or before the Effective Time or such vote, as the
case may be;

 

(ii) upon written notice to the other party (A) (x) 30 or more days after the
date upon which any application for a regulatory or governmental approval
necessary to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall have been denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of
the applicable Governmental Entity, unless within such 30-day period a
petition for rehearing or an amended application is filed or noticed, or (y)
30 or more days after any petition for rehearing or amended application filed
pursuant to clause (A)(x) is denied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
hereto shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b)(ii) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth
herein; and in each case the time period for appeals and requests for
reconsideration has run; or (B) if any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued a final non-appealable order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



54 (c) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) in writing if Seller or
Seller Sub has, or by Seller (on behalf of itself and Seller Sub) in writing
if Acquiror or Acquiror Sub has, breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or undertakings contained herein, which
breach or failure to perform would result in the failure to satisfy the
closing conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a), as the case may be,
and cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written
notice of such breach to the non-terminating party;

(d) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) if (i) Acquiror
notifies Seller in accordance with Section 5.3(c) that it does not intend to
enter into negotiations with Seller to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement to match or better a Superior Proposal or (ii)(A) Sellers board of
directors fails to make the Seller Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, (B) after making the Seller Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Seller effects a Change in the Seller Recommendation,
(C) Seller breaches its obligations under this Agreement by failing to
prepare and mail to its stockholders the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
failing to call or convene the Special Meeting in accordance with Section 5.8
(except to the extent such failure is a result of Acquirors breach of its
obligations hereunder) or (D) Sellers board of directors has authorized,
recommended or publicly announced its intention to authorize or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal with any persons other than Acquiror or Acquiror Sub or
if Seller otherwise breaches, in any material respect, its obligations under
Section 5.3 of this Agreement;

(e) by Seller, at any time prior to the approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Seller, for the purpose of entering into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, _provided_ , that Seller is not
in breach of any of its obligations under Section 5.3 or Section 5.8 of this
Agreement; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that any such purported termination
pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) shall be void and of no force or effect unless
Seller has paid the Termination Fee and the Expense Fee in accordance with
Section 7.4; or

(f) by Acquiror (on behalf of itself and Acquiror Sub) if holders of more than
5.0% of the shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding at any time prior to
the Closing Date exercise appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL.

7.2 _ Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VII, no party to this Agreement shall have any liability
or further obligation hereunder to the other party hereto, except that this
Section 7.2, Section 5.6(b), Section 7.4 and Article VIII shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and termination will not relieve a breaching
party from liability for any willful breach of any covenant, undertaking,
representation or warranty in this Agreement giving rise to such termination.

7.3 _Amendment, Extension and Waiver_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior to the consummation of the
Parent Merger, whether before or after approval thereof by the stockholders
of Seller, the parties may (i) amend this Agreement; (ii) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (iii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or (iv) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein (other
than required stockholder and regulatory approval); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that after any approval of the Parent Merger by the stockholders of Seller,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment
or waiver of this Agreement that requires further stockholder approval
under applicable Law.

(b) This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party and which has been
authorized by or under the direction of its board of directors; but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other matter.

 



55 7.4 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal Event shall
occur after the date of this Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by either Acquiror or Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i)(B) or by
Acquiror pursuant to Section 7.1(c) as a result of a willful breach by Seller
and (B) prior to the date that is one year after the date of such termination
Seller enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an
Acquisition Proposal with the party that gave rise to the Pre-Termination
Takeover Proposal Event, then Seller shall, on the earlier of the date of
such definitive agreement is executed or such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, pay Acquiror a fee equal to the sum of (i) $6,800,000 plus (ii)
all reasonable costs and documented expenses incurred by Acquiror in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including legal, accounting, investment banking, travel and printing expenses
up to $650,000 (collectively, the "Termination Fee"). The Termination Fee
shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) or by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(e), then concurrently
with such termination, if terminated by Seller, or within two Business Days
after termination, if terminated by Acquiror, Seller shall pay to Acquiror the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds, and such termination
shall not be deemed effective hereunder until payment by Seller of such fee.
In no event shall Seller be required to pay the Termination Fee under both
this Section 7.4(b) and Section 7.4(a).

 

(c) For purposes of this Section 7.4, a "Pre-Termination Takeover Proposal
Event" shall be deemed to occur if, prior to the event giving rise to the
right to terminate this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made known to the senior management or board of directors of Seller or shall
have been made directly to its stockholders generally, or any
person reasonably qualified to consummate an Acquisition Proposal shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal or public announcement
shall not have been irrevocably withdrawn not less than five Business Days
prior to the Special Meeting and Sellers stockholders fail to approve this
Agreement at such meeting (with respect to a termination pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i)(B)) or the date of termination (with respect to a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(c).

(d) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, each party would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Seller fails to pay promptly the Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 7.4 and, in order to obtain such payment, the other
party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the other for the
fee set forth in this Section 7.4, the non-successful party shall pay to the
other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of the fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made, plus 300
basis points.

(e) The parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub with respect
to this Agreement in the event any such payment becomes due and payable and is
paid, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, Seller and Seller Sub (and
Sellers and Seller Subs affiliates and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, stockholders and representatives) shall have no further
liability to Acquiror and Acquiror Sub under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller and Seller Sub shall not be relieved or released from
any liabilities or damages arising out of their willful and material breach of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the aggregate amount of any
damages determined by a court to be payable by Seller and Seller Sub pursuant
to the foregoing proviso shall be reduced by the amount of any Termination Fee
previously paid to Acquiror pursuant to this Section 7.4.

 

(f) For purposes of this Section 7.4, all references in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party

8.7 _Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Mississippi,
without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof (except
that matters relating to the fiduciary duty of Sellers board of directors
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof).

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect
of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court sitting in the
State of Mississippi, and, solely in connection with claims arising under this
Agreement or the Mergers that are the subject of this Agreement, (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such Mississippi courts,
(ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in
the Mississippi courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Mississippi
courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
8.3.

(c) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law at the time of institution of the
applicable litigation, any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
certifies and acknowledges that: (i) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver;
(ii) it understands and has considered the implications of this waiver; (iii)
it makes this waiver voluntarily; and (iv) it has been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this Section 8.7.

 



58 8.8 _Interpretation_. For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the
singular shall be held to include the plural and vice versa and words of one
gender shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires, (ii)
the terms "hereof," "herein," and "herewith" and words of similar import
shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a
whole (including all of the Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this
Agreement) and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Article,
Section, Disclosure Schedule and Exhibit references are to the Articles,
Sections, Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified, (iii) whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," (iv) the word "or" shall not be exclusive and (v) all
references to any period of days shall be deemed to be to the relevant number
of calendar days unless otherwise specified. This Agreement shall not be
interpreted or construed to require any person or entity to take any action,
or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate applicable Law.

The parties intend that each representation, warranty and covenant contained
herein shall have independent significance. If any party has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein in any respect, the
fact that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity)
that the party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact
that the party is in breach of the first representation, warranty or covenant.
Further, it is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar
amount in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or
the inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts or
higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material or would have a Seller Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, and neither party shall use the
fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such
item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule in
any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation,
item or matter not described in this Agreement or included in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement.

8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 7.4(e), the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties agree to waive any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond in connection with any remedy described in this Section 8.9
(except to the extent required by Law).

8.10  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

8.11 _Additional Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the
Surviving Corporation shall consider that any further assignments or
assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, Seller and its proper officers and directors
shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments
and assurances in Law and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect
or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties and assets in
the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement; and the proper officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
are fully authorized in the name of Seller or otherwise to any and all such
actions after the Effective Time.

 



59 8.12 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, before the Effective Time, Acquiror may at any
time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by
this Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be
necessary, appropriate or desirable;  _provided_ , that (a) any such change
shall not result in any adverse federal income tax consequences of the Mergers
to holders of Seller Common Stock or to Acquiror, Acquiror Sub, Seller or
Seller Sub and (b) no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or
kind of the Merger Consideration or (ii) jeopardize or materially delay the
receipt of any required regulatory approvals of the Merger or the satisfaction
of any other conditions set forth in Article VI hereof. In the event Acquiror
elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

CONVERSION OF SHARES

3.1 CONVERSION OF SHARES. At the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror, Seller or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Each share of Acquiror Common Stock (as defined below) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding after the Effective Time and shall be unaffected by the Merger.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 3.1, each share of Seller
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any shares of Seller Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 3.1(e) and shares of Seller Common Stock held by stockholders
who exercise and maintain their appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL) shall, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.1(d), be
converted automatically into and thereafter represent the right to receive
the number of shares (or a fraction thereof) of Acquiror Common Stock, rounded
to the nearest four decimals, equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Merger
Consideration"). As used in this Plan of Merger, the term "Acquiror Common
Stock" means the common stock, $5.00 par value per share, of Acquiror, and the
term "Exchange Ratio" means 0.6066.

 

(c) Certificates previously evidencing shares of Seller Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates evidencing the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no fractional shares
of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment
shall be made pursuant to Section 3.1(f).

 



Exhibit A  Page 3  (d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Plan of Merger
and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of
capital stock of Acquiror or Seller, respectively, shall occur (or for which
the relevant record date will occur) as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or other
subdivision, combination or readjustment of shares, or as a result of any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if
necessary and without duplication, to reflect such change.

(e) Each share of Seller Common Stock held in the treasury of Seller and each
share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time that is owned by Acquiror or any subsidiary of Acquiror or Seller (other
than shares held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the
like or otherwise in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(f) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock will be issued as a result of the Merger. In lieu of the issuance of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.1(b), cash adjustments (without
interest) will be paid to the holder of Seller Common Stock in respect of any
fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable
to such holder of Seller Common Stock, and the amount of such cash adjustment
shall be determined by multiplying (x) the fraction of a share of Acquiror
Common Stock otherwise issuable by (y) the weighted average of the
closing sales prices of one share of Acquiror Common Stock as reported on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date. No such holder shall be

RECITALS:

 

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking corporation (the
"Acquiror Bank"), Metropolitan and Metropolitan Bank have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which
Metropolitan will be merged into Acquiror and Acquiror shall be the surviving
entity on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger
Agreement and Metropolitan Bank will be merged into Acquiror Bank and Acquiror
Bank shall be the surviving entity on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, in consideration of the agreements made by Metropolitan in connection
with the Merger Agreement, Acquiror has agreed to indemnify the Metropolitan
Official under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Acquirors agreement to indemnify the
Metropolitan Official and the expenses and costs that may be incurred by
Acquiror in connection with such indemnification, the Metropolitan Official
hereby agrees as follows:

 



   1. | _Assumption of and Cooperation in Defense_. 
---|--- 

1.1 _Notice and Assumption of Defense_. In the event a claim arises for which
indemnification is or may be sought by the Metropolitan Official, the
Metropolitan Official shall promptly notify Acquiror, in writing at the
address set forth in Section 3 hereof, of the commencement of such legal
action or existence of and facts relating to such claim. Upon receipt of such
notice, or at any time thereafter, Acquiror shall be entitled to participate
therein and, in its sole discretion, to assume the defense of such claim,
with counsel of its choice, subject to the reasonable approval of the
Metropolitan Official, and to consider and decide on any proposed settlement,
subject to the reasonable approval of the Metropolitan Official. In any and
all events, Acquiror shall have the right to reasonable control over the
nature and extent of expenses incurred in connection with such claim(s).
Acquiror shall notify the Metropolitan Official of its assumption of the
defense of such claim; and after such notice from Acquiror to the
Metropolitan Official, Acquiror shall not be liable to the Metropolitan
Official for indemnification under Section 5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement for
any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses of
defense subsequently incurred by such indemnified party.

1.2 _Cooperation in Defense_. The Metropolitan Official agrees to cooperate in
the defense of any action for which indemnification is sought under Section
5.13(b) of the Merger Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, providing Acquiror and its counsel copies of any and all relevant
documents relating to the claim, consulting with Acquiror and its counsel
with regard to the claim, providing testimony, either in deposition or at
trial or both, regarding the facts relating to the claim, making himself
available at reasonable times for consultation, testimony and fact-finding
and otherwise furnishing such information to Acquiror and its counsel as the
Metropolitan Official would provide to his own counsel in the event he were
defending the action himself. Except as expressly permitted by Acquiror, the
Metropolitan Official shall not object to the production or use of any
documents heretofore prepared by or of information provided to Acquiror legal
counsel on the basis of any claim of privilege that is available only to
Metropolitan or Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror

 



Schedule 5.13(b)  Page 1  agrees that it will not, without the consent of the Metropolitan Official,
waive any applicable privilege of the Metropolitan Official. Such cooperation
shall be provided regardless of whether Acquiror assumes the defense of the
action.



   2. | _Duplication of Payment; Limitations; Presumptions_. 
---|--- 

2.1 _No Duplication of Payments_. Acquiror shall not be liable under this
Agreement to make any payment in connection with any claim against the
Metropolitan Official to the extent the Metropolitan Official has otherwise
actually received payment (under any insurance policy, certificate of
incorporation, bylaw provision or otherwise) of amounts otherwise
indemnifiable hereunder.

2.2 _No Presumption_. For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with
or without court approval) shall not of itself create a presumption that the
Metropolitan Official did or did not meet any particular standard of conduct
or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that
indemnification is not permitted by applicable law.

 

3\. _Notices_. All notices or other communications which are required or
permitted hereunder shall be delivered in accordance with Section 8.3 of the
Merger Agreement, at the addresses listed below:

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and

executed counterpart of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute due and
sufficient delivery of such counterpart, and such facsimile shall be deemed

VOTING AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

 



Schedule 5.17-A  Page 1 VOTING AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

 

This Voting and Non-Competition Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and
executed as of the day of  , 2017, between Renasant
Corporation, a Mississippi corporation ("Acquiror"), and the undersigned non-
employee director ("Metropolitan Official") of Metropolitan BancGroup, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Metropolitan"), or Metropolitan Bank, a Mississippi
banking corporation ("Metropolitan Bank").

 

Acquiror, Renasant Bank, a Mississippi banking corporation ("Acquiror Bank"),
Metropolitan and Metropolitan Bank have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the "Plan of Merger"), pursuant to which the parties thereto agree
that (i) Metropolitan will merge with and into Acquiror (the "Merger"), and
Acquiror shall be the surviving entity of the Merger, and (ii) Metropolitan
Bank will merge with and into Acquiror Bank (the "Bank Merger"), and Acquiror
Bank shall be the surviving entity of the Bank Merger. In consideration of the
expenses that Acquiror will incur in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Plan of Merger, and in order to preserve the value of the
franchise to be purchased by Acquiror and induce Acquiror to proceed to incur
such expenses, the Metropolitan Official makes the following agreements in
favor of Acquiror:

1\. _Undertakings of Metropolitan Official_.

 

1.1 The Metropolitan Official agrees and undertakes during the term of this
Agreement to vote or cause to be voted in favor of the Plan of Merger all
shares of common stock of Metropolitan, $0.01 par value per share (the
"Metropolitan Stock"), as to which he has voting power (other than shares held
in a fiduciary capacity), which amount of shares is shown on the schedule
attached hereto and made a part hereof (the "Shares"), at any meeting or
meetings of the stockholders of Metropolitan at which such matters are
considered (including any and all adjournments thereof). The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing in this section or this Agreement
is intended to dictate or require that the Metropolitan Official vote as a
director in any manner, and nothing in this Agreement: (i) will limit or
affect any actions or omissions taken by the Metropolitan Official as such a
director, including in exercising rights under the Plan of Merger, and no such
actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or (ii) will
be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict the Metropolitan Official from
exercising Metropolitan Officials fiduciary duties as a director of
Metropolitan.

1.2 The Metropolitan Official further agrees that during the term of this
Agreement, he will not transfer any of the Shares, except (i) for transfers by
operation of law and (ii) for transfers in connection with which Acquiror has
consented to the transfer and the transferee shall agree in writing with
Acquiror to be bound by this Agreement as fully as the undersigned.

1.3 This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
Effective Time and (ii) the date on which the Plan of Merger terminates in
accordance with its terms.

 

2\. _Noncompetition Obligations of Metropolitan Official_.

 

2.1 Metropolitan Official will not:

(a) directly or indirectly, for himself or in affiliation with any business
or entity in which he owns an equity or financial interest (except as to not
more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding stock of any corporation, the
securities of which are regularly traded on a nationally recognized
securities exchange or over-the-counter market), carry on or engage in any
Competitive Business (as hereinafter defined) within the Restricted Area (as
hereinafter defined); or

 

(b) directly or indirectly, in affiliation with any individual or any business
or entity not covered by (a) above, whether as a partner, employee,
contractor, consultant or otherwise, carry on or engage in any Competitive
Business in the Restricted Area; or

 



Schedule 5.17-A  Page 2 (c) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any customers of
Acquiror or Acquiror Bank, with respect to any Competitive Business in the
Restricted Area; or

(d) directly or indirectly, solicit or cause to be solicited any employees,
contractors or agents of Acquiror or Acquiror Bank to terminate their
employment, contract or relationship with Acquiror or Acquiror Bank.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Restricted Area" shall mean the
State of Mississippi and the State of Tennessee, and the term "Competitive
Business" shall mean the business of banking, including, without limitation,
checking and savings accounts, business and personal loans, interim
construction and residential loans, student loans, automated
tellers machines, internet banking services and accounts receivable
financing.

2.2. The noncompetition obligations set forth in Section 2.1 shall extend
until the second anniversary of the Closing (as defined in the Plan of Merger)
(the "Restricted Period").

 

2.3. Acquiror and the Metropolitan Official agree that the foregoing
restrictions are reasonable under the circumstances and that any breach of
the covenants contained in this Section 2 would cause irreparable injury to
Acquiror. The Metropolitan Official understands that the foregoing
restrictions may limit the Metropolitan Officials ability to engage in
certain businesses during the period provided for above in the Restricted
Area, but acknowledges that the Metropolitan Official will receive sufficient
remuneration and other benefits under the Plan of Merger to justify such
restriction. Further, the Metropolitan Official acknowledges that his skills
are such that he can be gainfully employed in non-competitive employment, and
that the agreement not to compete will in no way prevent him from earning a
living. If any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic
area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the
restrictions therein set forth to be modified by the court making such
determination so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified, to
be fully enforced. By agreeing to this contractual modification prospectively
at this time, the parties intend to make this provision enforceable under the
laws of Mississippi in the Restricted Area so that the entire agreement not
to compete and this Agreement as prospectively modified shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be rendered void or illegal.

 

3\. _Miscellaneous_.

3.1 The Metropolitan Official acknowledges that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Metropolitan Official,
and Acquiror shall be entitled to seek to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement by specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such
breach or any threatened breach, without any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond or giving any other undertaking (except to the extent
required by law). Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies
for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all remedies
available at law or in equity to Acquiror, including, without limitation, the
recovery of damages from the Metropolitan Official and his or her
agents involved in such breach.

3.2 The Metropolitan Official acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement is
executed in connection with the sale of all of the business of Metropolitan.
The Metropolitan Official further acknowledges and represents that the
provisions of this Agreement will not work a hardship on him and will not
prevent him from engaging in his occupation.

 

3.3 To the extent permitted under applicable law, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended or modified at any time, either before or after its
approval by an agreement in writing among the parties hereto.

3.4 This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to constitute an original. Each such counterpart shall become effective
when one counterpart has been signed by each party hereto. Delivery of a copy
of this Agreement bearing an original signature by facsimile transmission or
by electronic mail in "portable document format" form shall have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

 



Schedule 5.17-A  Page 3 3.5 This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Mississippi applicable to agreements made and
entirely to be performed within such State, except as federal law may be
applicable.

 

3.6 The Metropolitan Official may not assign any of his rights or obligations
under this Agreement to any other person.

 

3.7 This Agreement supersedes any and all oral or written agreements and
understandings heretofore made between the parties hereto relating to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement does not modify or amend any
stock option agreement, employment agreement, option or similar employee
benefit agreement between Metropolitan or an affiliate of Metropolitan and the
Metropolitan Official. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors, heirs and legatees.

3.8 In the event that any party institutes any legal suit, action or
proceeding against the other party to enforce the covenants contained in this
Agreement (or obtain any other remedy in respect of any breach of this
Agreement), the prevailing party in the suit, action or proceeding shall be
entitled to receive in addition to all other damages to which it may be
entitled, the costs incurred by such party in conducting the suit, action or
proceeding, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and court costs.

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have signed this Agreement effective as of the
date first set forth above.

EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

THIS EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and entered
into by and between Curtis J. Gabardi ("Executive") and Renasant Bank, a

Time," as defined in that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among
Renasant Corporation (the "Company"), the Bank, Metropolitan BancGroup, Inc.
and Metropolitan Bank (the Metropolitan entities collectively, the
"Metropolitan Entities") dated as of January 17, 2017 (the "Merger
Agreement"), _provided that_ if the Effective Time shall not occur as
contemplated under the Merger Agreement, this Agreement shall be deemed void
and of no force and effect.

 

2\. Employment; Term and Renewal:

2.1 Position. The Bank shall employ and retain Executive as its President,
Chief Banking Officer, or in such other capacity or capacities as shall be
mutually agreed upon, from time to time, by Executive and the Bank, and
Executive agrees to be so employed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein. Executives duties and responsibilities shall be those assigned
to him, from time to time, by the Bank and shall include such duties as are
the type and nature normally assigned to similarly situated officers of a
financial institution of the size, type and stature of the Bank. Executive
shall report to the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank.

 

2.2 Full Time and Attention. During the Employment Term (as defined below),
Executive shall devote his full time, attention and energies to the business
of the Bank and will not, without the prior written consent of the Banks
Chief Executive Officer, be engaged (whether or not during normal business
hours) in any other business or professional activity, whether or not such
activities are pursued for gain, profit or other pecuniary advantage.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be prevented from: (a)
engaging in any civic or charitable activity for which Executive receives no
compensation or other pecuniary advantage; (b) investing his personal assets
in businesses which do not compete with the Bank, _provided that_ such
investment is solely that of an investor; or (c) purchasing securities in any
corporation whose securities are regularly traded on an established market,
_provided that_ such purchases will not result in Executive owning
beneficially at any time 5% or more of the equity securities of any
corporation engaged in a business competitive with that of the Company or the
Bank and Executives investment is solely that of an investor.

2.3 Term; Renewal. Executives employment under this Agreement shall commence
as of the Effective Date and shall terminate on the two-year anniversary
thereof (the "Initial Term"). At the end of the Initial Term and on each
anniversary of such date thereafter (each a "Renewal Date"), this Agreement
shall be automatically extended for an additional one-year period (a "Renewal
Term"), unless either party shall provide written notice to the other that
this Agreement shall not be extended, such notice to be provided not less
than 60 days prior to any Renewal Date or the expiration of the Initial Term,

amount of $425,000, which amount shall be prorated and paid in equal
installments in accordance with the Banks regular payroll practices and
policies (Executives "Base Compensation"). Such compensation shall be

4. Executives Separation From Service:

4.1 Condition Precedent. Except for the payment of the Mandated Amounts (as
defined below), as a condition of the receipt of any payment or the provision
of any benefit described in this Section 4, Executive shall timely execute and
deliver to the Bank a waiver and release, substantially in form attached
hereto as Exhibit B, subject to such modification as the Bank may deem
necessary or appropriate, from time to time (a "Release"), which shall be
provided to Executive not later than on the Executives Separation Date (as
defined in Section 4.2).

 

4.2 Separation on Account of Death or Disability. If Executive dies or becomes
Disabled, this Agreement and Executives employment hereunder shall terminate

provided, which cannot be waived. Payment or provision of the Mandated
Amounts shall be made at the time or times and in the form prescribed under
the applicable governing documents or in accordance with governing law, as the
case may be.

 

As used herein, the term "Accrued Cash Bonus" shall mean the amount payable,
if any, under the PBRP for the most recently completed fiscal year preceding
the year in which Executives Separation Date occurs, which amount has not
been paid as of Executives Separation Date; such amount, if any, shall be
paid at the time such bonuses are ordinarily paid under the PBRP.

 

As used herein, the term "Disabled" or "Disability" or words of similar import
shall mean that Executive is: (a) unable to engage in any substantial gainful
activity due to a medically-determinable physical or mental impairment that
can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at
least 12 months, as determined by a physician appointed by the Bank

account of Cause. In the event of a separation for Cause hereunder, the Bank
shall provide written notice to Executive, including a description of the
specific reasons for its determination of Cause and any cure period that may
be available to remedy the events giving rise to such determination. As of
Executives Separation Date, which may be the date on which such notice is
provided to Executive or the date on which the Bank reasonably determines that
the events giving rise to Cause have not been cured to its reasonable
satisfaction (to the extent a cure period has been provided in the discretion
of the Bank), the Bank shall pay or provide to Executive the Mandated Amounts
and shall have no further obligation hereunder.

As used herein, the term "Cause" shall mean and be deemed to have occurred if

and Exchange Commission or any other governmental agency implementing the
provisions of these laws. 
---|--- 
 



Schedule 5.22(i)  Page 4 No act or failure to act on the part of Executive shall be deemed
"intentional" if it is due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence,
but will be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by
Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that his action(s)
or omission(s) are in the best interest of the Company, the Bank or an
affiliate thereof.

4.4 Executives Constructive Termination. Executive may terminate this
Agreement and his employment hereunder on account of Constructive

Date. 
---|--- 
 



   d. | The vesting or settlement of any outstanding grant or award under

   b. | A material reduction in Executives authority, duties or
responsibilities from those contemplated in Section 2.1 of this Agreement;

written notice of his objection to such event or condition, which notice shall
be provided no later than 30 days after Executive first knows, or should first
know, of its occurrence; (b) such event or condition is not reasonably
corrected by the Bank promptly after receipt of such notice, but in no event

service, such separation occurring not more than 30 days following

---|--- 



   b. | Executive shall continue to perform services for the benefit of

   a. | The Mandated Amounts. 
---|--- 



   b. | Any Accrued Cash Bonus. 
---|--- 



   c. |

A cash payment equal to _two times_ the aggregate of Executives: (i) Base

---|--- 
 



Schedule 5.22(i)  Page 6 to be paid in the form of a single-sum not more than 60 days following
Executives Separation Date. 
---|--- 
 



   d. | If Executive and/or his dependents timely elect to continue group
medical, dental or vision coverage within the meaning of Code Section
4980B(f)(2) with respect to a plan sponsored by the Bank (other than a
health flexible spending account under a self-insured medical reimbursement
plan described in Code Section 125), the amount of the applicable continuation

   e. | Any outstanding award or grant shall vest, or be deemed free of
restriction or otherwise settled as provided under the terms the LTIP.

5.3 Limitation. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if the aggregate of all payments and benefits due to
Executive hereunder, including any payment or benefit provided to Executive
under a separate plan or arrangement (collectively, the "Aggregate Payments")
would result in any such payment being a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Code Section 280G, such payments shall be reduced to the minimum
extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of
such payments and benefits, as so reduced, shall be deemed to constitute an
"excess parachute payment." For this purpose:



   a. | The determination of whether any reduction in the Aggregate
Payments is required hereunder shall be made at the expense of the Bank and by
the Banks independent accountants or another independent accountant
agreed upon by Executive and the Bank. 
---|--- 



   b. | In the event that any portion of the Aggregate Payments is
required to be reduced hereunder, then the reduction shall occur in the
following order: (i) reduction of the amount payable under Section
5.2c hereof; (ii) reduction of Accrued Cash Bonus; and (iii) forfeiture of
any grant or award under the LTIP. Within any of the foregoing categories, a
reduction shall occur first with respect to amounts that are not deemed to
constitute "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of and subject to
Code Section 409A ("Nonqualified Deferred Compensation") and then with respect
to amounts that are treated as Nonqualified Deferred Compensation, with
such reduction being applied in each case to the payments in the reverse
order in which they would otherwise be made (that is, later payments shall be
reduced before earlier payments). 
---|--- 
 

6\. Limitations On Activities:

6.1 Consideration for Limitation on Activities. Executive acknowledges that
the execution of this Agreement constitutes consideration for the covenants
contained herein, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by
Executive.

 

6.2 Confidential Information. Executive recognizes and acknowledges that
during the Employment Term and at all times thereafter, Executive will
have access to or possess confidential, proprietary, non-public information
concerning the Company, the Bank, their affiliates, and their predecessors,
including but not limited to the Metropolitan Entities (collectively, the
"Protected Entities"), whether or not considered a "trade secret" under
applicable law ("Confidential Information"), which may include, without
limitation: (a) books, records and policies relating to operations,
finance, accounting, personnel and management; (b) information related to any
business entered into by the Protected Entities; (c) credit policies and
practices, databases, customer and prospective customer lists, depositor and
prospective depositor lists, and information obtained on competitors and
tactics; (d) various other non-public trade or business information, including
business opportunities and expansion or acquisition strategies, marketing,
business diversification plans, methods and processes; and (e) retail
marketing and operating policies and practices, including without limitation,
policies and practices concerning the identity, solicitation, acquisition,
management, resale or cancellation of unsecured or secured credit card
accounts, loan or lease accounts, other accounts relating to consumer products
and services and depository arrangements.

 



Schedule 5.22(i)  Page 7 Executive agrees that Confidential Information is the property of and owned by
the Bank and the Company. Executive further agrees that he will not, whether
during the Employment Term or at any time afterwards, make any independent use
of, or disclose to any other person or organization, any Confidential
Information, _except_ : (a) as may be customarily required in the course of
his employment with the Bank; (b) as may be expressly authorized by the Bank;
(c) as may be required by law or legal process, _provided that_ Executive
shall furnish to the Bank not less than five business days prior to such
disclosure, or such shorter period as may be necessitated by facts and
circumstances, written notice of such law or process, including a copy of all
relevant documents, and shall cooperate with the Bank to object to or
to limit such disclosure or to place such disclosure under seal; or (d) if
and to the extent such information shall have become public information, other
than on account of Executives breach of this covenant. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, subsection (c) shall not limit Executives ability to communicate
with any government agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or
proceeding that may be conducted by any government agency, including providing
documents or other information, without notice to the Bank or the Company.

6.3 Non-Solicitation. Executive agrees that during the two-year period
commencing on his Separation Date (regardless of the reason therefore), he
shall not, directly or indirectly, for his own benefit, on behalf of another,
or to the Bank or the Companys detriment:

 



   a. | Solicit for any business purpose, hire or offer to hire, or
participate in the business solicitation or hiring of, any officer or employee
of a Protected Entity, including officers and employees of the Bank during
the 24-month period preceding Executives Separation Date; 
---|--- 



   b. | Persuade, or attempt to persuade, in any manner any officer,
employee, agent or consultant of a Protected Entity to discontinue any
relationship with a Protected Entity; or 
---|--- 
 



   c. | Solicit or divert, or attempt to solicit or divert, any customer
or depositor of the Bank, as determined during the 24-month period preceding
Executives Separation Date, including any prospective or potential customer
or depositor of the Bank with respect to which the Bank has expended material
efforts to solicit before his Separation Date. 
---|--- 
 

6.4 Non-Competition. Executive agrees that he shall not, for a period of two
years following his Separation Date in respect of a separation described in
Section 5.2 hereof, or for a period of one year following his Separation Date
in respect of any other reason therefore, whether as an employee, officer,
director, shareholder, owner, partner, joint venturer, independent
contractor, consultant or in another managerial capacity, engage in the
Banking Business within the Restricted Area. For purposes of this Section 6.4,
the term "Banking Business" shall mean the management and/or operation of a
retail bank or other financial institution, securities brokerage, or
insurance agency or brokerage. The term "Restricted Area" shall mean area
within the 50-mile radius of any geographic location in which the Bank has a
substantial branch or office on Executives Separation Date. The parties
agree that Executives ownership of not more than 5% of the equity securities
of any financial institution shall not constitute a breach of this covenant,
provided that Executive is solely an investor with respect thereto.

6.5 Business Reputation. Executive agrees that during the Employment Term and
at all times thereafter, he shall refrain from making or publishing any
adverse, untrue or misleading statement which has, or may reasonably be
anticipated to have, the effect of demeaning the name or business reputation
of the Company or the Bank, _except_ to the extent true and required by law
or legal process.

6.6 Reformation. The parties agree that each of the covenants set forth herein
is intended to constitute a separate restriction. Should any covenant be
declared invalid or unenforceable, such covenant shall be deemed severable
from and shall not affect the remainder thereof. The parties further agree
that each of the covenants contained herein is reasonable in both time and
geographic scope. If and to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction or an
arbitrator, as the case may be, determines that any of the covenants is
unreasonable, then it is the intention of the parties that such covenant or
covenants be enforced to the fullest extent that such court or arbitrator
deems reasonable and that this Agreement shall be deemed reformed to the
extent necessary to permit such enforcement.

 



Schedule 5.22(i)  Page 8 6.7 Remedies. In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Executive of
the provisions of this Section 6, Executive agrees that the Bank shall be
entitled to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction
without the necessity of posting bond in connection therewith, whether in a
court of law or by means of arbitration, in the Banks discretion. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the Bank from pursuing any
other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach, whether in
law or equity, including the recovery of damages from Executive.

Executive further agrees that upon the issuance of a temporary restraining
order, the Bank may, in its discretion, suspend any payments or benefits due
to Executive or his dependents under this Agreement; _provided that_ such
payments shall be resumed when the Bank reasonably determines that such breach
or threatened breach has been corrected or cured, to the extent that
such breach is susceptible of correction or cure. The Bank shall provide to
Executive written notice of the events giving rise to Executives breach or
threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement, including a statement
as to whether the Bank reasonably believes that such breach or threatened
breach is susceptible of cure, at least two business days before seeking a
temporary restraining order hereunder. Thereafter, Executive may correct such
breach or threatened breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the Bank;
_provided that_ if Executive fails to correct such breach or threatened breach
within such two-day period, nothing contained herein shall preclude or delay
the Banks ability to seek a temporary restraining order hereunder.

7\. Miscellaneous:

 

7.1 Mitigation Not Required. As a condition of any payment hereunder,
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of such payment by
seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings
or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset,
reduction or any other obligation on the part of Executive under this
Agreement.

 

7.2 Enforcement of This Agreement. In addition to the equitable remedies
provided under Section 6 hereof, which need not be exclusively resolved by
arbitration in the discretion of the Bank, in the event that any legal dispute
arises in connection with, relating to, or concerning this Agreement, or in
the event of any claim for breach or violation of any provision of this
Agreement, Executive agrees that such dispute or claim will be resolved by
arbitration. Any such arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") concerning the
resolution of employment disputes. Any such dispute or claim will be
presented to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of the Executive
and the Bank (or the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the rules
of the AAA). All determinations of the arbitrator will be final and binding
upon the Executive and the Bank. Except as provided in Section 7.3 hereof,
each party to the arbitration proceeding will bear its own fees and costs in
connection with such arbitration proceedings,  _except that_ unless otherwise
paid by the Bank in accordance with such section, the costs and expenses of
the arbitrator will be divided evenly between the parties. The venue for any
arbitration proceeding and for any judicial proceeding related to this
arbitration provision (including a judicial proceeding to enforce this
provision) will be in Jackson, Mississippi.

7.3 Attorneys Fees. In the event any dispute in connection with this
Agreement arises with respect to obligations of Executive or the Bank, as the
case may be, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
its reasonable attorneys fees, costs, and all expenses incurred in that
action or proceeding.

7.4 No Set-Off or Defense. There shall be no right of set-off or counterclaim
in respect of any claim, debt or obligation against any payment to Executive
provided for in this Agreement. Executives claim that the Bank has breached
this Agreement shall not constitute a justification or defense for
Executives breach of any provision hereof.

7.5 Assistance with Litigation. For a period of two years after his
Separation Date, Executive will furnish such information and provide such
assistance as may be reasonably necessary in connection with any litigation in
which the Bank (or an affiliate) is then or may become involved, without
the payment of a fee or charge, except reimbursement of his direct expenses.

not be assigned by him without the prior written consent of the Bank. This
Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Bank, its
affiliates, successors and assigns, including, without limitation, any person,

7.12 Severability. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to be
severable. In the event that any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or

other provision of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision was not contained herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no provision shall be severed if it is
clearly apparent under the circumstances that the parties would not have
entered into this Agreement without such provision.

7.13 Withholding. The Bank or an affiliate may withhold from any payment
hereunder any federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld.

 



Schedule 5.22(i)  Page 10 7.14 Survival. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligation of the Bank to make any payment or provide any
benefit as of Executives Separation Date under Section 4 or 5 hereof shall
survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, as the case may be.
The covenants imposed on Executive under Section 6 hereof shall remain
operative and in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
regardless of the expiration or termination of this Agreement or Executives
separation from employment hereunder. The parties further agree that the
provisions of this Section 7 shall survive the termination or expiration of
this Agreement for any reason.

7.15 Waiver. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more
instances upon performance of any terms or conditions of this Agreement will
not be construed as a waiver of future performance of any such term, covenant,
or condition and the obligations of either party with respect to such term,
covenant or condition will continue in full force and effect.

7.16 Code Section 409A. To the extent applicable, the parties intend that
this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with
the applicable provisions of Code Section 409A, including any regulations or
other guidance promulgated thereunder. For purposes thereof: (a) each payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment; (b) the
exclusions for short-term deferrals and payments on account of involuntary
termination of employment shall be applied to the fullest extent applicable;
(c) payments to be made upon a termination of employment or on account of
Executives Separation Date that are deemed to constitute deferred
compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A shall be made upon
Executives "separation from service" as determined thereunder; (d) any
reference herein to the termination of Executives employment or to
Executives termination date or words of similar import shall mean and be
deemed to refer to the date of his "separation from service" within the
meaning of Code Section 409A; (e) if Executive is a "specified employee"
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, payments that are deemed to
constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A and
that are payable on account of Executives separation from service, shall be
delayed for six months as required under Code Section 409A, and shall be made
when first permitted, without liability for interest or loss of investment
opportunity thereon; (f) to the extent they constitute deferred compensation
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, all reimbursements and in-
kind payments to be provided hereunder during one calendar year may not
affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be
provided, in any other calendar year; and (g) any reimbursement of an eligible
expense shall be made promptly after proper substantiation of such expenses,
but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the expense was incurred and the right to reimbursement
or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any
other benefit.

7.17 Construction. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall be
construed as a whole, according to fair meaning, and not strictly for or
against any party. In drafting this Agreement, Executive has been represented
by counsel of Executives choosing, and the terms of this Agreement have been
fully negotiated by the parties hereto. The parties agree that, in the event
of any ambiguity, this Agreement should not be construed against the Bank
solely as a result of being drafted by counsel for the Bank.

 

7.18 Execution. This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be
an original, and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same agreement. Facsimile or "PDF" transmissions of any executed original

shares of the Companys common stock, $5.00 par value per share, under the

Employment Agreement as of such date.

right the right to vote the shares represented by your Retention Award and

TERMINATION AGREEMENTS

 



Schedule 5.22(ii)  Page 1 TERMINATION AGREEMENT

 

THIS TERMINATION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into by and between
Metropolitan BancGroup, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
Metropolitan Bank, a state non-member bank organized under the laws of the
State of Mississippi (collectively, the "Metropolitan Entities"), and [TO
COME] ("Executive").

 

1\. Recitals: This Agreement is made in consideration of the following:

 

a. Executive entered into that certain Employment Agreement by and between the
Company and Executive originally dated [TO COME], which employment agreement
was most recently amended and restated in the form of an Amendment and
Restated Employment Agreement by and between Executive and the Metropolitan
Entities, dated as of [TO COME] (collectively, the "Employment Agreement").

b. The Metropolitan Entities have now entered into that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger by and between the Metropolitan Entities and Renasant
Corporation and Renasant Bank, dated as of January 17, 2017, pursuant to which
the Company will merge with and into Renasant Corporation, with Reansant
Corporation continuing as the surviving entity thereafter, and Metropolitan
Bank will merge with and into Renasant Bank, with Renasant Bank continuing as
the surviving entity thereafter (the "Merger Agreement").

 

c. As a condition of the consummation of the transactions contemplated under
the Merger Agreement, the Metropolitan Entities and Renasant Corporation and
Renasant Bank have agreed to unilaterally terminate the Employment Agreement
and make a certain payment to Executive, as more fully provided herein.

 

2\. Effectiveness. As of the effective time of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the "Effective Time")
and except as specifically provided herein, the Employment Agreement shall
terminate and be extinguished in its entirety, the Metropolitan Entities shall
have no further obligations thereunder, and such Employment Agreement shall be
of no further force and effect; _provided, however_ , that should the
transactions contemplated under the terms of the Merger Agreement not be
consummated as provided thereunder, the Employment Agreement will not
terminate and will continue in accordance with its terms. The termination of
the Employment Agreement is being effected by the unilateral action of the
Metropolitan Entities and as directed by Renasant Corporation and Renasant
Bank pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

 

3\. Payment. Upon termination of the Employment Agreement, the Company
(including any successor thereto) shall (i) pay to Executive in a single lump
sum, subject to applicable withholdings, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 business days thereafter, the
aggregate amount Executive would have received under the Employment Agreement
had the Employment Agreement not been terminated and the Company had
terminated Executives employment without cause immediately after the change
in control resulting under the Merger Agreement (the "Payment"), and (ii)
cause Executive to receive such other amounts or benefits to which Executive
would be entitled under such same circumstances. The preliminary estimate of
the Payment and a description of such other benefits and amounts are set forth
on the attached _Exhibit A_.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the amount of the
Payment cannot be finally determined until after the Effective
Time. Accordingly: (a) if the preliminary estimate of the Payment is in
excess of the amount finally payable under the Employment Agreement, Executive
shall not be entitled to receive or shall return the excess; and (b) if the
preliminary estimate of the Payment is less than the amount actually payable
under the Employment Agreement, the Company shall pay the shortfall. For
purposes hereof:

 

a. The determination of whether any amount is payable hereunder and the amount
of such payment, if any, shall be made at the expense of the Company and by
the Companys independent accountants. Such determination shall be made as
soon as administratively practicable and no later than 60 days after the later
of:

 



Schedule 5.22(ii)  Page 2  (i) the Effective Time; or (ii) the date on which amounts payable under the
Companys 2015 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan have been determined, but in any
event no later than one year after the Effective Time.

b. Any amount payable hereunder shall be paid no later than ten business days
following the date on which the determination of the Companys independent
accountants is provided to the parties, but in no event later than one year
after the Effective Time.

 

4\. Survival. Notwithstanding the termination of the Employment Agreement as
provided herein, those certain covenants contained in Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8
of the Employment Agreement, including the remedies for breach thereof
contained in Section 9 of the Employment Agreement, shall survive the
termination of such agreement and be and remain enforceable in accordance with
their terms, assuming that any amount payable under the Employment Agreement
as a condition of the enforcement thereof had been paid and Executives
separation from service occurred as contemplated under Section 3.3 of such
agreement.

 

5\. Executives Acknowledgement. Executive is entering into this Agreement
solely to acknowledge that the Company will make the Payment to Executive as
the result of the unilateral termination of the Employment Agreement in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Merger
Agreement and to acknowledge the survival of the covenants contained
in Section 5, 6, 7, and 8 thereof. Executive also acknowledges that, subject
to adjustment as provided in paragraph 3 hereof, the amount of the Payment
equals what Executive would be entitled to receive under the Employment
Agreement had the agreement not been terminated and Executives employment
been terminated by the Company without cause immediately after the change in
control resulting under the Merger Agreement. Neither the Metropolitan
Entities nor Renasant Corporation and/or Renasant Bank have solicited
Executives consent to termination of the Employment Agreement nor is such
termination contingent upon the Executives consent.

 

6\. General:

a. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia applicable to contracts
wholly performed in such state, without giving effect to the conflicts of law
principles thereof.

 

b. In the event that any legal dispute arises in connection with, relating to,
or concerning this Agreement the parties agree that such dispute or claim
will be resolved by arbitration. Any such arbitration proceeding shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association
("AAA") concerning the resolution of employment disputes. Any such dispute or
claim will be presented to a single arbitrator selected by mutual agreement of
the Executive and the Metropolitan Entities (including any successors
thereto), or the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the rules of
the AAA. All determinations of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon
the parties hereto. Each party to the arbitration proceeding will bear its own
fees and costs in connection with such proceedings, and the costs and expenses
of the arbitrator will be divided evenly between the parties. The venue for
any arbitration proceeding, and for any judicial proceeding related to this
arbitration provision (including a judicial proceeding to enforce this
provision), will be in Atlanta, Georgia.

 

c. Executive agrees that there shall no presumption that any ambiguity
contained herein is to be resolved against the Metropolitan Entities solely
because they are considered a drafting party. Instead, the language of all
parts of this Agreement shall be construed as a whole, and according to their
fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any of the parties.

 

d. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
Metropolitan Entities, including their successors, and assigns, including,
without limitation, Renasant Corporation and Renasant Bank. This Agreement
will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Executive, his heirs, estate,
beneficiaries, legatees and legal representatives. The Payment due to
Executive hereunder shall be paid to his surviving spouse after his death, or
if Executive is not survived by a spouse, to his estate.

 



Schedule 5.22(ii)  Page 3 e. This Agreement constitutes the final and complete understanding and
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and there are no other agreements, understandings, restrictions,
representations or warranties among the parties.

 

f. Each provision of this Agreement is intended to be severable. In the event
that any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall for any reason
be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, but this
Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision was not contained herein and shall be deemed reformed
to the extent necessary to permit such construction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no provision hereof shall be severed if it is clearly apparent
under the circumstances that the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement without such provision.

g. All notices and other communications under this Agreement must be in
writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand,
(b) sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (receipt
requested), or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent in another manner,
in each case as follows:

h. The termination and payment under this Agreement is intended to comply with
the exception under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Section 409A") for termination of nonqualified deferred
compensation plans within the meaning of Section 409A upon a change in control
of the employer. Accordingly, this Agreement will be construed
and administered in all events consistent with that intent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein is intended as an admission that the Employment
Agreement is subject to Section 409A as a non-exempt nonqualified deferred
compensation arrangement.
