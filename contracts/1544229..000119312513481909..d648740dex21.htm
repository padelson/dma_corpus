ARTICLE 1

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence
the Offer under the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of
Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
the Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to
the conditions set forth in _Exhibit B_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The
initial expiration date of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") shall
be midnight (New York City time) on the twentieth (20th) Business Day
following commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")). Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any condition to
the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except that, without the written
consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (A) reduce the number of shares
of the Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the Offer Price
except in accordance with _Section 1.1(e)_, (C) waive or amend the Minimum
Tender Condition, add to the Offer Conditions or modify any Offer Condition
in any manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock, (D) except
as otherwise provided in this _Section 1.1(a)_, extend the Offer, (E) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (F) otherwise amend the
Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for the
minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position
of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, but not beyond the
Outside Date. In addition, if at the otherwise scheduled expiration date of
the Offer any Offer Condition is not satisfied (or to the extent permitted
hereby, waived) and until such time as such conditions are satisfied, Merger
Sub may, in its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company, or if
requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, extend the Offer for one (1) or more occasions, in consecutive increments
between two (2) and ten (10) Business Days each, with the length of such
period to be determined by Merger Sub or, in the event such extension is
requested by the Company, such period between two (2) and (10) Business Days
as the Company requests (or in any event such other period as the parties
hereto may agree) (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to
which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger
Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger
Sub to, extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (i) the valid
termination of this

 



2  Agreement in accordance with _Article 9_ and (ii) the Outside Date. Merger
Sub may, in its sole discretion, make available one (1) or more "subsequent
offering periods", in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, of
not less than three (3) Business Days and not more than twenty (20) Business
Days in the aggregate for all subsequent offering periods. On the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to any
withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 4.2(f)_) all shares of the Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer promptly after
the expiration of the Offer.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC, pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation
M-A under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related
letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent
and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of shares of the Company Common Stock as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by
the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably
requested by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion therein. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by
it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and to correct
any material omissions therein; and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take
all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause
the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC
and the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to
the Companys shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel copies of any written comments, and shall inform the
Company and its counsel of any oral comments or discussions, that
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from or engage with the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments or the commencement or occurrence of any such discussions. Prior
to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer
Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or
response (including the proposed final version thereof), and Parent and Merger
Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made
by the Company or its counsel.

(c) Subject to the terms and the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
and the satisfaction (or, if permitted to be waived by Parent and Merger, the
waiver by Parent and Merger Sub) of the Offer Conditions, (i) as soon as
practicable after the applicable Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall accept for
payment and promptly (and in any event within three (3) business days (as
determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after such
acceptance) pay for, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accept for payment
and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance for payment, the
" _Acceptance Time_ ," and the time of such payment, the " _Offer Closing_ "),
or (ii) in the case of any shares of Company Common Stock tendered during any
subsequent offering period, Merger Sub shall immediately accept for payment
and promptly (and in any event within three (3) business days (as determined
using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay for, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for, all such shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered during such period.

 



3 (d) (i) If at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition
shall not have been satisfied or waived and no further extension or re-
extensions of the Offer are required pursuant to _Section 1.1(a)_, Merger Sub
may irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer upon delivery of a
written notice to the Company, and (ii) if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article 9_ , then Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article 9_ , (i) Merger Sub shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
return, all tendered shares of the Company Common Stock to the registered
holders thereof and (ii) any "standstill" or similar covenant in the
Confidentiality Agreement previously waived by the Company shall, without any
further action by the Company, be automatically reinstated and be deemed to
be in full force and effect.

(e) If, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall be
changed into a different number of shares or a different class (including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period but excluding any change that results from any
exercise of Company Stock Options that are outstanding as of the date hereof),
the Per Share Merger Consideration, Offer Price and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement and the Offer (including the exercise of
the Top-Up Option), unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and
Merger Sub, any shares of Company Common Stock subject to notices of
guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be validly tendered into the Offer
unless and until the shares underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are
delivered to or on behalf of Merger Sub.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves of the Offer, the Top-Up
Option, the Merger and the other Transactions and to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation (subject only to the
Companys right to make an Adverse Company Recommendation Change in accordance
with the provisions of _Section 7.4(d)_) and of references to and all
other material disclosures relating to the Company Financial Advisor and the
Fairness Opinion.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.4_, the Company shall file with the SEC, as
promptly as practicable on or after the date of the filing by Parent of the
initial Offer Documents (and in any event by January 30, 2014), a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, as amended from time to time, the " _Schedule
14D-9_ ") describing the Company Board Recommendation referred to in _Section
5.4(d)_, and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of the Company
Common Stock (concurrently with the Offer Documents). The Company shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 the Company Board Recommendation and the
Fairness Opinion. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or reasonably requested by the Company
for inclusion therein. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect and to correct any material omissions
therein. The Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Federal securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel
copies of any written

 



4  comments and shall inform Parent and its counsel of any oral comments that
the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments. Prior to
the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent or its counsel.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to furnish Merger Sub promptly (but in any event not later than three (3)
Business Days following the date hereof) with mailing labels containing the
names and addresses of the record holders of the Company Common Stock as of a
recent date and of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to such
date, together with copies of all updated lists of shareholders, security
position listings, computer files and all other information in the Companys
possession or control as Parent may reasonably request regarding the
beneficial owners of the Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub
such information and assistance (including updated lists of shareholders,
security position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the Companys shareholders. Subject to
the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement the information contained in
any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request of the Company, return to the Company or
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control.

 

(d) During the five (5) Business Days before the then-scheduled Expiration
Date (as may be extended pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or the
then-scheduled expiration date of any subsequent offering period and on the
first (1st) Business Day following the Expiration Date (as may be extended
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) or the expiration date of any
subsequent offering period, promptly following the request of Parent or Merger
Sub, the Company shall certify to Parent and Merger Sub in writing as to (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (including
Company Restricted Shares), (ii) the number of Company Restricted Shares then
outstanding, (iii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in
respect of Company Stock Options then outstanding, (iv) the Companys
computation of the number of Fully Diluted Shares then outstanding, with
supporting detail, (vii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
authorized and available for issuance and sale by the Company to Merger Sub
in connection with an exercise of the Top-Up Option and (viii) any other
information in the possession of the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub in order to enable Parent and Merger Sub to determine
whether or not the Minimum Tender Condition has been or would be satisfied.

1.3 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 1.3(b)_ and _Section 1.3(c)_, the Company hereby
issues to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), for so
long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions
hereof, to purchase from the Company that number of shares of the Company
Common Stock equal to the number of shares of the Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent at the time of exercise
of the Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one share of the Company Common
Stock more than 90% of the Fully Diluted Shares at such date, assuming the
issuance of all shares of the Company Common Stock to be issued upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option (such shares of the Company Common Stock to be issued
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the " _Top-Up Shares_ ").

 



5 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Merger Sub during the two-Business
Day period following the time at which shares of the Company Common Stock are
first accepted pursuant to the Offer, or if any subsequent offering period is
provided, during the two-Business Day period following the expiration date of
such subsequent offering period; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable (i)
to the extent that the number of shares of the Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but
unissued shares of the Company Common Stock that are not reserved or otherwise
committed to be issued at the time of the exercise of the Top-Up Option, (ii)
if any law then in effect shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or
the delivery of the Top-Up Shares, and (iii) unless Parent or Merger Sub has
accepted for payment all shares of the Company Common Stock validly tendered
in the Offer and not withdrawn. The Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the
earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 9_. The aggregate purchase price payable
for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up
Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such Top-Up Shares by
the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase price may be paid by Merger
Sub, at its election, either (A) entirely in cash or (B) by paying in cash an
amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of such Top-Up Shares
and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any such
promissory note shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub, shall
bear interest at the rate of three percent (3%) per annum, shall mature on the
first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without
premium or penalty and shall have no other material terms. Without the prior
written consent of the Company, the right to exercise the Top-Up Option
granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only once and shall not be
assigned by Merger Sub. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section
1.3(b)_ shall be null and void.

 

(c) In the event that Merger Sub shall exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall deliver to the Company written notice (the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting
forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase
pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to
pay the applicable purchase price pursuant to  _Section 1.3(b)_ and (iii)
the place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares
by Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that, promptly following such
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall consummate the Merger in
accordance with Section 11.05 of the MBCA as contemplated by _Section
7.6(b)_. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub the Top-Up Shares. At the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, the Company shall cause to be issued to
Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto
agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice
is deemed received by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.2_, and if not so
consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties
hereto further agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger
to be consummated in accordance with the MBCA as contemplated by _Section
7.6(b)_, subject to applicable law, as close in time as possible after
(including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate to ensure
that any issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished in a manner consistent
with all applicable laws.

 



6 (d) Parent and Merger Sub understand that the Top-Up Shares will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving
a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents and warrants to
the Company that Merger Sub will be upon any exercise of the Top-Up Option an
"accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under
the Securities Act. With respect to the Top-Up Option and the issuance of the
Top-Up Shares, each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants and agrees
that the Top-Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale
in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any
legends required by applicable securities laws.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree and acknowledge that, in any appraisal
proceeding under Part 13 of the MBCA with respect to Dissenting Shares, the
Surviving Corporation shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the Top-Up
Shares or any cash or promissory note delivered by Merger Sub to the Company
in payment for such Top-Up Shares should be considered in connection with the
determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Part 13 of the MBCA.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER

4.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any holder of any stock or other equity ownership interest of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Each share (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ") of
the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except as otherwise provided in _Section 4.1(b)_ and Shares (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") that are, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, owned by
shareholders (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ ") entitled to appraisal rights and
to obtain payment of the fair value of their Shares and who have perfected
and not withdrawn a demand for or otherwise lost their right to appraisal
pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA with respect to such Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, in cash and without
interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). All such Shares, when so
converted, no longer shall be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of Shares) evidencing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration therefor, subject to applicable
withholding tax, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
_Section 4.2_. 

 



8 (b) Each Share held by the Company in treasury or owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company,
if any, immediately prior to the Effective Time (including as a result of an
exercise of the Top-Up Option by Merger Sub) shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, the cash required to make
payments in respect of the Merger consideration as required by this _Article
4_ (such cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the cash
payments contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 4.1_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of outstanding Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 4.1_,
(i) a letter of transmittal (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration for each Share evidenced thereby. Except as provided in
_Section 4.1(b)_, upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as the Exchange Agent shall reasonably require (or, if such
Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares on a book-
entry account statement), the holder of such Certificates (or uncertificated
Shares, as the case may be) shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced thereby, in accordance with
_Section 4.1_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as provided in this _Section 4.2(b)_, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration for each Share
evidenced thereby. No interest will be paid or accrue on any amounts payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(c) All Merger consideration paid upon exchange of the Shares in accordance
with the terms hereof will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Shares so exchanged.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares for six (6) months after the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article 4_ will thereafter look only to Parent
for payments in respect of the applicable Merger consideration payable
pursuant to this

 



9  Agreement. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates (or instruments for the Company Restricted
Shares) shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2) years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any of
the Merger consideration would otherwise escheat or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any amounts payable in respect thereof, to the extent
permitted by law, shall become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest on any person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Exchange Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. Any
amounts deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent to the appropriate Governmental Entity on a
timely basis.

 

(g) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
consideration payable with respect to the Shares evidenced by such
Certificate. Delivery of such affidavit and the posting of such bond shall be
deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the Shares for purposes of
this _Section 4.2_.

 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as
directed by Parent or Merger Sub. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to, or as directed by, Parent or Merger
Sub. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such payment of
interest or income delay the receipt by holders of Certificates of the
Merger consideration, or otherwise impair such holders rights hereunder.

(i) Any portion of the aggregate Merger consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

4.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company,
except for the right to receive the Merger consideration pursuant to _Section
4.1_, without interest. All cash paid upon the surrender of the Certificates
in accordance with this _Article 4_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly evidenced by such
Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and no transfer of Shares which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made, other than to settle
transfers of Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions

 



10  of this Agreement, Certificates formerly evidencing Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and, except as provided in
_Section 4.1(b)_, exchanged for the Merger consideration in accordance with
this _Article 4_.

4.4 _Treatment of Company Stock-Based Securities_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to provide
that each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any stock option plan, program or
agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party (the "
_Company Stock Option Plans_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled as of the
Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, an amount in cash payable at the time
of cancellation of such Company Stock Option equal to the product of (A) the
excess, if any, of (x) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (y) the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option.
Such cash payment shall be subject to and reduced by all applicable Taxes to
be withheld in respect of such payment. The surrender of a Company Stock
Option in exchange for the consideration contemplated by this _Section
4.4(a)_ shall be deemed a release of any and all rights the holder had or may
have had in respect thereof; _provided_ , that for any Company Stock Option
where no payment is required to be made under this _Section 4.4(a)_ because
such payment amount would be equal to or less than zero, such Company Stock
Option will be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time without any
exercise thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that all outstanding restricted stock
awards (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall automatically become fully
vested and free of any forfeiture restrictions at the Effective Time, and the
Company will take all necessary or appropriate action, including obtaining any
required consents or amendments to the Companys equity incentive plans or
award agreements, to permit holders of outstanding Company Restricted Shares
to be treated in the Merger on the same terms and conditions as all other
holders of unrestricted Shares.

(c) Simultaneously with the consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub shall pay
to the Company an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of
consideration to be paid by holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this
_Section 4.4_, and the Surviving Corporation shall cause such consideration
to be paid to such holders as promptly as practicable following the Closing.

(d) The Company shall take all steps reasonably required to cause the
transactions contemplated by this  _Section 4.4_, including any disposition
of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in
connection with the Transactions by each individual who is or will become a
director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, upon the
Effective Time, (i) the Company Stock Option Plans, and any similar plan,
program or agreement of the Company pursuant to which Company Securities may
be granted or issued shall be terminated, and (ii) no Person shall have any
right under or with respect to the Company Stock Options, the Company
Restricted Shares or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to
equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, except the right
to receive the amounts payable under this _Section 4.4_, if any. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall instruct its stock transfer agent,
promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event no later than on the first
(1st) Business Day after the Effective Time occurs), to remove all Company
Restricted Shares from the Companys stock ledger.

 



11  The Company shall provide notice (in a form reasonably satisfactory to
Parent) to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option and each Person
in whose name the Company holds any Company Restricted Shares describing the
treatment of such Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Share, as
applicable, in accordance with this _Section 4.4_.

 

4.5 _Dissenting Shares_ . No Person who, prior to the Effective Time, is
entitled to appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of his
shares and who has perfected appraisal rights and a right to obtain payment of
the fair value of his shares pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA with respect to
any Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting Shares unless and until
such Person shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section
13.23(b) of the MBCA) or otherwise lost such Persons right to appraisal
pursuant to the MBCA with respect to such Dissenting Shares. Unless and until
a Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively so withdrawn or lost such
Dissenting Shareholders right to appraisal pursuant to the MBCA with respect
to such Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to
receive only the payment provided by Section 13.24, Section 13.25, Section
13.26 or Section 13.30 (as applicable) of the MBCA with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shareholders
shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or receive any dividends or
distributions, other than pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable law that are received by the Company relating to Company
shareholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings which take place prior to the Effective Time
with respect to demands for appraisal and payment by Company shareholders
under Part 13 of the MBCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands.

business as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. Other than its Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of the
Subsidiaries beneficially owns or controls, directly or indirectly, five
percent (5%) or more of any class of equity or similar securities of any
corporation or other entity whether incorporated or unincorporated.  _Section
5.3(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies all Subsidiaries of the
Company and their respective jurisdictions of organization. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational
documents for each Subsidiary, as currently in effect. No Subsidiary of the
Company is in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents, as currently in
effect.

securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have
been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien,
other than Liens expressly specified in the organizational documents of each
Subsidiary and restrictions imposed under the Securities Act. Other than the
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company that is owned by the
Company, directly or indirectly through one or more Subsidiaries, there are no

other voting securities or ownership interests in any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, (ii) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of, or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the
Company or (iii) warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock or ownership interests in, or
any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, any capital stock or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company or (iv) restricted
shares, stock appreciation rights, performance units, "phantom" stock or
similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide economic

interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through
(iv) being referred to collectively as the " _Company Subsidiary Securities_
"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the
Company Subsidiary Securities.

Agreement and the amendments to the Rights Agreement constitute valid and
binding agreements of the Company enforceable against the Company in

limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors rights
generally, and (ii) general equitable principles.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions do not and will not (i)

Liens, encumbrances, filings, notices, Permits, authorizations, consents,
approvals, violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 



15 (c) No declaration, filing or registration with, or notice to, or
authorization, Permit, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is
necessary with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions except for (i) (A) applicable requirements,
if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or "blue
sky" laws or the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Market (" _Nasdaq_
"), (B) the Required Statutory Approvals, (C) the filing with the SEC of (1)
the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9, (2) if required under applicable law,

_Information Statement_ ") required under Rule 14f-1 in connection with the

Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as required by the

registrations or notifications or to obtain such authorizations or consents
would not individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

adopted resolutions (i) approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) determining that the terms
of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair

any other Transaction. The Company Board has taken such action as required to
render Section 6A of the Companys Articles of Organization inapplicable to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Voting Agreements or any other
Transaction.

 

(e) The affirmative vote of the holders of a two-thirds majority of the total
voting power of the outstanding Shares (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_

securities necessary to approve the Merger.

 

5.5 _SEC Matters_.

(a) The Company has timely filed with or otherwise furnished to the SEC,
within the time periods or extensions thereof prescribed under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, all forms, reports, proxy statements,
schedules, statements, prospectuses, registration statements and other
documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since January
1, 2010 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). None of the Company
SEC Documents is the subject of an outstanding SEC comment letter or
outstanding SEC investigation as of the date hereof. As of their respective
dates (or, if amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, as of the date so amended, supplemented or
superseded), the Company SEC Documents (i) complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a

statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included
in the Company SEC Documents (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and
each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, comprehensive
income and shareholders equity included in the Company SEC Documents
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presented in all
material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in
shareholders equity or comprehensive income, as the case may be, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein, and were
prepared in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the
case of unaudited statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments. The
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal financial
officer of the Company have made the certifications required by Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to
the Company SEC Documents that were required to be accompanied by such
certifications. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(b) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15
under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that (i) all information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management, including the Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, or individuals performing
similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. The Companys internal controls over financial reporting are
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. No significant deficiency, material
weakness or fraud (with respect to fraud, whether or not material), that
involves management or other employees was identified in managements
assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2012 or has otherwise been
disclosed to the Companys management or Board of Directors (or committee
thereof) between such date and the date of this Agreement.

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no Person, whether or
not employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence
of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or

or officers), or has been at any time during the last two (2) years, subject
to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court, governmental
department, commission, agency, instrumentality or authority, or any
arbitrator which has had or would reasonably be expected to have,

acknowledge and agree that, for all purposes of this Agreement, no party makes
any representation or warranty regarding the effect of the antitrust laws on
such partys ability to execute, deliver or perform its obligations under
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger as a result of the enactment,
promulgation, application, or threatened or actual judicial or administrative
investigation or litigation under, or enforcement of, any antitrust law with
respect to the consummation of the Merger.

at all times during the last three (3) years, have been in compliance with all
laws applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or assets, except
for instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
During the last three (3) years, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the knowledge of the Company,
oral communication from any Governmental Entity that (i) alleges that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not in material compliance with, or is
subject to any material liability under, any law, or (ii) notifies the Company

franchises, permits, licenses, approvals and authorizations (collectively, "
_Permits_ ") of all Governmental Entities required by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to own and operate their respective assets and carry on their
respective businesses as currently conducted, except where the failure to
obtain, have and maintain such Permits, or the suspension or cancellation of
any of such Permits would not have or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries is, and at all times during the past three
(3) years has been, in compliance with all such Permits, except for any
failures to be in compliance that have not had and would not be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and since
January 1, 2010 the Company has not received any written notice of any such
breach, violation, default or event. To the knowledge of the Company, there

the Internal Revenue Service, as applicable, and there are no facts or
circumstances that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Company Plan.

(e) Each Company Plan has been established, maintained and administered in
material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any
and all laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. Neither the
Company, any ERISA Affiliate of the Company, nor, to the knowledge of

Company Plan that would be reasonably likely to subject the Company or the
Parent or their Subsidiaries to any Taxes or penalty (civil or otherwise)
imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable law.

(f) Except as set forth on _Section 5.13(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the Transactions will not (either alone or
together with any other event, including, any termination of employment)
entitle any current or former officer, employee, director or other independent
contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary to any change in control payment or
benefit, transaction bonus or similar benefit or severance pay or accelerate

contractor of the Company or a Subsidiary, which claims could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability to the Company or a Subsidiary,
and no audit by any domestic or foreign governmental or other law enforcement
agency is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, has been proposed with
respect to any Company Plan. With respect to any Company Plan, the Company is
not a party to any agreement or understanding with the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of Labor.

meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, provide for continuing benefits or coverage
after termination or retirement from employment, except for COBRA rights under
a "group health plan" as defined in

 



21  Section 4980B(g) of the Code and Section 607 of ERISA. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the continuation
coverage provisions of COBRA and any applicable law mandating health
insurance continuation coverage for employees.

(i) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company has used the
services or workers provided by Third Party contract labor suppliers,
temporary employees, "leased employees" (as that term is defined in Section
414(n) of the Code), or individuals who have provided services as independent
contractors, to an extent that would reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any of the Company Plans or the imposition of penalties or
excise taxes with respect to any of the Company Plans by the Internal
Revenue Service, the Department of Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation.

(j) Each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"

exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of the underlying
equity as of the date such Option, stock appreciation right or other similar
right was granted, (ii) has no feature for the deferral of compensation other
than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or
disposition of such Company Stock Option, stock appreciation right or other
similar right, (iii) to the extent it was granted after December 31, 2004,

issued with respect thereto), and (iv) has been properly accounted for in

Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

7.4 _No Solicitation by Company_.

 

(a) _General Prohibitions_. Except as expressly permitted by _Section
7.4(b)_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor shall the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any
action to knowingly facilitate or encourage the making by any Person (other
than Parent and its Affiliates) of any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue, or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) in furtherance of an inquiry or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal,

hereunder, (iv) subject to  _Section 7.4(e)_, grant any waiver or release
under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (v) resolve or
propose to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall take, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to take, all actions reasonably necessary to cause its
Representatives to immediately cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and
its Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date
hereof

 



39  with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request
each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with its consideration of an Acquisition Proposal, if any, to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as
expressly permitted by _Section 7.4(d)_, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (A) fail to make, withdraw, qualify or modify (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make),
qualify or modify) in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend or propose to adopt,
approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) any Acquisition Proposal, (C) (x)
fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (y) fail
to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case of (x)
and (y) within three (3) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing,
(D) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation
14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 within three (3) Business Days after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal, or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger in the
Proxy Statement (any action described in the foregoing clauses (A) through
(E), an " _Adverse Company Recommendation Change_ "). It is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this _Section
7.4(a)_ by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be a breach of this _Section 7.4(a)_ by the Company.

 

(b) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding _Section 7.4(a)_, but subject to _Section
7.4(c)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company or any of
its Representatives has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board reasonably believes constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may, as long as the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives shall not have previously breached or taken any action
inconsistent with _Section 7.4(a)_, (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives, and (ii) furnish to
such Third Party or its Representatives or financing sources non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to such Third Party, in each case pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all such information (to the extent that such information
has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or
made available to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided
or made available to such Third Party;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that prior to taking (and thereafter continuing) any action described in
_Section 7.4(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_ above, (A) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable law and (B) the
Company Board determines in good faith, based on the information then
available and after consultation with its independent financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this
Agreement, enter into any confidentiality agreement that would prohibit them
from providing such information to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board, at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders required to be made by applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or
exchange offer), or (ii) making any required disclosure to shareholders with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal, in each case so long as such action is
consistent with this _Section 7.4_ and if the Company Board determines
in good faith after consultation with outside counsel that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , that, the foregoing shall
not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change except pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_ hereof or to
otherwise modify the definition of Adverse Company Recommendation Change.

 



40 (c) _Required Notices_. The Company Board shall not take any of the actions
referred to in  _Section 7.4(b)_ unless the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of taking such action. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any notification to the Company
(or any of its Representatives) that would reasonably be expected to result
in an Acquisition Proposal or of any request received by the Company (or any
of its Representatives) for information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that has
made, or that has notified the Company (or any of its Representatives) that it
is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
identify the Third Party making, and the terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent
informed, on a current basis, in reasonable detail of the status and terms of
any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request or any other
negotiations with Third Parties and shall promptly (but in no event more than
twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent copies of all material
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal.

(d) _Adverse Company Recommendation Change_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company Board may at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, (i) make an Adverse Company Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event and/or a Superior Proposal or (ii) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ and concurrently enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Company Board shall not take any action described in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) unless (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that (1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
or (2) that an Intervening Event has occurred and, in either case, that
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (B) the Company shall have
continuously complied with its obligations under this _Section 7.4_, and,
with respect to a termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(i)_, the Company
shall have complied with all applicable requirements of  _Section 9.1(d)(i)_
and _Section 9.2(b)_ (including the payment of the Company Termination Fee
and Termination Expenses prior to such termination) and (C) the Company
promptly notifies Parent in writing, at least three (3) Business Days before
taking such action, of such determination of the Company Board and of its
intention to effect an Adverse Company Recommendation Change in response to
such Intervening Event or Superior Proposal, and shall have complied with the
remaining provisions of this _Section 7.4(d)_. Such notice in response to an
Intervening Event shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the
decision by the Company Board to take such action and during such three (3)
Business Day period, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, engage in good
faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for such Adverse Company Recommendation Change, in which
case the Company Board shall not take any action described in clauses (i) and
(ii) above. Such notice in response to a Superior Proposal shall attach a
reasonably detailed description of the proposed agreement and terms under
which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and identify the
Third Party making such Superior Proposal and, during such three (3) Business
Day period, the Company shall (and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to) negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that (x) the delivery of
such notice shall not in and of itself constitute an Adverse Company
Recommendation Change and (y) any material amendment to the financial terms or
other

 



41  material terms of such Superior Proposal following the initial three (3)
Business Days period shall require a new written notification from the Company
and a new three (3) Business Day good faith negotiations period under this
_Section 7.4(d)_ (it being understood and agreed that there shall be a
maximum of one (1) such three (3) Business Day negotiations period and,
thereafter, each successive negotiation period shall be two (2) Business
Days) and, during such time, the Company Board shall not take any action
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary and _provided_ that (i) there has been no prior breach of the
provisions of this _Section 7.4_, (ii) the Company Board believes in good
faith, upon the advice of its financial advisor, that such action would likely
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company provides to
Parent one (1) Business Days advanced notice of the Boards determination to
take such action, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board
may grant a waiver or release under, or determine not to enforce, any
standstill agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would violate
its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not otherwise modify the Companys or its Representatives
obligations under this _Section 7.4_.

 

7.5 _Regulatory and Governmental Matters_.

 

(a) Without limiting _Section 7.7_, the parties will cooperate fully with
each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transactions and to comply with the terms and conditions of all
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Entities. The Company and Parent will have the right to review in advance,
and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case,
subject to applicable law relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The parties will consult with each other with respect to
obtaining all Permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the Transactions.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company will, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, if any, the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9, the Information Statement or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions.

 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity and any material
communication given or received in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case in connection with the Transactions.

 



42 7.6 _Company Shareholder Approval; Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) At any time following the written request of Parent to the Company, the
Company shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in
preliminary form, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required to be set forth in
the Proxy Statement or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion

Merger Sub promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff
and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply Parent and
Merger Sub with other copies of all correspondence between the Company and
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement. If at any time prior
to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval there shall occur any event
that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its shareholders
such an amendment or supplement. The Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement prior to its
being filed with the SEC and shall provide Parent and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review all amendments and supplements to the Proxy
Statement and all responses to requests for additional information prior to
their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. The Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent or its
counsel, recognizing that the ultimate form and content of the Proxy
Statement, any amendments and supplements thereto, and any response to
requests for additional information will be the responsibility of the
Company. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing in definitive form with the SEC.

(b) At any time after the later of (x) the Initial Expiration Date, (y) the
expiration of the time period contemplated by Rule 14a-6(a) under the
Exchange Act and (z) the resolution of any comments on the Proxy Statement
from the SEC (the " _Clearance Date_ "), the Company shall have the right to
(i) establish a record date (which will be as promptly as reasonably
practicable), (ii) duly call and give notice of a meeting of its shareholders
for the purpose of seeking the Company Shareholder Approval (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ ") and (iii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
after such record date, each for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder
Approval. If not previously undertaken by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall have the right, at any time on or after the date upon which the Company
may elect to take such actions as described above, to request in writing that
the Company, and upon receipt of such written request, the Company shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) take the actions specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
_Section 7.6(b)_.

 

(c) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, (i) convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting
and (ii) through the Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they
give the Company Shareholder Approval (except to the extent that the Company
Board shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Offer or the Merger as permitted by _Section 7.4(d)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Merger Sub and any other affiliate of Parent
collectively acquire at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock, Parent promptly shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, cause the
Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after the Acceptance Time
without a shareholders meeting or a written consent in accordance with Section
11.05 of the MBCA. 

 



43 (d) Parent and Merger Sub shall, in the case of a Company Shareholders
Meeting, cause all shares of the Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to
the Offer and all other shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their affiliates to be voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement.

 

7.7 _Agreement to Cooperate; HSR Filings; DSS_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties

deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts, and shall provide such assistance as reasonably
requested by Parent, in connection with the matters set forth on _Section
7.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company undertake and
agree to file as soon as practicable (and in any event not later than ten

Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ").

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in _Section 7.7(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and
authorizations for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other Regulatory
Law, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any request by the FTC or DOJ for additional information and
documents or any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any

party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other
in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any such

or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other

conferences ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties may comply with this
clause (iii) by designating that certain sensitive information shall only be
shared with the respective parties outside legal counsel), and (iv) promptly
take reasonable actions to respond to inquiries from the FTC, DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the legality under any antitrust law of the
Merger; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that all obligations in this _Section
7.7(c)_ shall be subject to applicable laws relating to exchange of
information and attorney-client communication and privileges.

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company undertake to use commercially reasonable
efforts to contest and resist any Action, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether

 



44  temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits
the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
party is required to contest or appeal any such order issued by a United
States Court of Appeals.

(e) Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, as soon as possible, confirmation from the applicable
Governmental Entities that they will not recommend that the Companys security
clearances be revoked, suspended or downgraded as a result of the consummation
of the Transactions. The Company shall and shall cause its employees to make
all filings or notifications or such other actions as are necessary or
appropriate in order to prevent the security clearances of the Company and
their respective employees from being revoked, suspended or downgraded;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have approval rights over the content and form
of all related communications, filings and notifications and shall be entitled
to participate in all related discussions. 

(f) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
prepare and submit, in a form acceptable to the cognizant security agency, to
the Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ ") of the United States Department of

industrial security regulations, and any other applicable customer, national
or industrial security regulations or customer program security requirements;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have approval rights over the content of all
related communications, filings and notifications and shall be entitled
to participate in all related discussions, where acceptable to the cognizant
security agency. To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to work together with Parent to
obtain assurances that, in accordance with the NISPOM, the Surviving
Corporation will be granted National Interest Determinations required for
authorizing continued access to proscribed or other classified or unclassified
controlled information following the Effective Time to the extent necessary
for the Surviving Corporation to continue to perform certain of the Companys
Government Contracts.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including _Section 7.5_ and this _Section 7.7_), neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor any of their Affiliates is required to (i) enter into any agreement,
consent decree or other commitment requiring Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to
divest or hold separate any assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) or (ii) take
any other action that, individually or in the aggregate, would impose a
material restriction on the conduct of the business of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the business of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 

7.8 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to (i) afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
Representatives of Parent, reasonable access during the period prior to the

feasible and not otherwise reasonably requested by Parent, be afforded in
whole or in part through electronic means) at all reasonable times, and (ii)
instruct its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent in its
investigation. During such period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state laws applicable to such party, and (ii) all
other information concerning its business, financial condition (including on
no less than a weekly basis, the Companys existing cash reporting and other
related information as requested, and accounts 

 



45  receivable and accounts payable balances) properties and personnel as Parent
may reasonably request. No information learned will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder or limit
or otherwise affect the conditions hereof or the remedies available hereunder
to Parent or Merger Sub.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent nor any of
their Subsidiaries will be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would, in the opinion of outside
counsel, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its
Subsidiaries, require security clearance for disclosure or contravene any law,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course of business; _provided_ , that the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure under circumstances in which the restrictions of this
sentence apply. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, will promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC and/or mailing to the shareholders of the
Company of such amendment or supplement, in each case as promptly as
practicable.

(c) All information provided to Parent and its Representatives pursuant to
this _Section 7.8_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the
Closing and, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article 9 _such
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in accordance with its terms.

7.9 _Expenses and Fees_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Transactions are consummated; _provided_ , that any fee for any filing
by Parent under the HSR Act will be paid by Parent.

7.10 _Public Statements; Other Communications_. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree that, from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement
concerning the Transactions shall be issued or made by any party without the
prior consent of the other party or parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by law or exchange rule, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party or
parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, to the extent required, shall be at the final
discretion of the disclosing party. Parent and the Company shall agree on the
content of all general announcements made to, or other material
correspondences with, the Companys and its Subsidiaries employees,
suppliers, customers and other material business relations regarding the
execution of this Agreement and the Transactions contemplated hereby
(including any employee "QandA," group e-mails, group voicemail and any other
form of communication), and in all events Parent shall be afforded
the reasonable opportunity to participate in any material discussions or
communications with any of the foregoing Persons related to the Transactions
or the impact thereof.

 

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to the Companys 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_2011 ESPP_ "), no later than the date hereof, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the 2011 ESPP), shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that (i)
the Offering Period (as defined in the 2011 ESPP) in progress as of the date
of this Agreement be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date (as defined in
the 2011 ESPP) that is

 



46  five (5) business days prior to the consummation of the Offer in accordance
with the notice requirements of Section 18(c) of the 2011 ESPP, provided,
however, that if the original Exercise Date (as defined in the 2011 ESPP)
would occur sooner than such New Exercise Date, the Offering Period will not
be shortened as provided in this subsection (i), (ii) each participants right
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the 2011 ESPP shall
terminate immediately following the New Exercise Date (or Exercise Date)
described in subsection (i), (iii) no participant may increase his or her
contribution election under the 2011 ESPP at or following the date hereof,
(iv) no individual who is not currently a participant in the 2011 ESPP as of

at or following the date hereof, (v) the 2011 ESPP shall be

described in subsection (i) with respect to the current Offering Period until
the earlier of (x) the consummation of the Offer and (y) the termination of

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, seniority and
eligibility to participate) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (including leave and paid time off) (the "New Plans"), Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide that each Company Employee, subject to
applicable law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, (i) be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to receive
credit for such service pursuant to the applicable Company Plan and (ii)
receive credit for deductible payments and out-of-pocket and co-payments made,
under any similar Company Plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to receive credit for such deductible payments and out-of-pocket and co-
payments made under such Company Plan; provided, that the foregoing shall not
apply with respect to benefit accrual under any plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits.

(c) For a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing,

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director or officer may
have under any employment or indemnification agreement in effect on the date
hereof, from the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(the " _Indemnitors_ ") shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person
who is at the date of this Agreement or during the period from the date of
this Agreement through the Closing Date serving as a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law,
as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any judgments,
fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect
of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement) resulting
therefrom, and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days
after any request for advancement, advance ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances to the extent required by applicable law) to each of the Indemnified
Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as
now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a
witness with respect to or otherwise participating in any Claim in advance of
the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or
advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement
of any bond or other security. The indemnification and advancement obligations
of the Indemnitors pursuant to this _Section 7.12(a)_ shall extend to acts
or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the consideration and approval thereof _and_ the
process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall
continue as to a person who continues to be or who has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date
of this Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of such persons heirs,
executors and personal and legal Representatives. As used in this _Section
7.12(a)_: (A) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or
completed Action, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental
Entity or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes
might lead to the institution of any such Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration, mediation
or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Party in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at
or prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the term 

 



48  " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses,
court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding
costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges and costs of
enforcing this _Section 7.12_) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to
this _Section 7.12(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment in any Claim in respect of which indemnification has been
or could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless (i) such
settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim and does not
contain any continuing restrictions on such Indemnified Party or (ii) such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the
Companys Articles of Organization or its Bylaws (or, as applicable, the
charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement,
or other organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
identified on _Section 7.12(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at
the Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the Companys
Articles of Organization and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to
the Effective Time, were directors, officers, trustees, employees or agents,
unless such modification shall be required by law and then only to the minimum
extent required by law.

 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain for a period of at least six (6)
years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability coverage maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
on or before the Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions;
_provided_ , that (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured (
_provided_ , that such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of
coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Effective Time), (ii) in
no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to
this  _Section 7.12(d)_ more than an amount per year of coverage equal to
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid by the
Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ that, with the consent of
the Company, prior to the earlier of (x) the Effective Time and (y) such time
as Parents or Merger Subs designees constitute a majority of the Company
Board, the Surviving Corporation may purchase in lieu of the
foregoing requirements a run-off or tail insurance policy, in each case, with
reputable and financially sound carriers, with at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that are substantially the same as, or
more favorable than, those of the Companys current policies, including
deductibles and caps that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
than those in effect as of the date of this Agreement, covering acts or
omissions 

 



49  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in respect of the
Transactions. In the event that, but for the first proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend
more than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid
by the Company, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the current annual premiums paid by the Company.
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successors or
assigns to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to
honor all obligations thereunder.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving limited liability company,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
_Section 7.12_.

 

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this  _Section 7.12_ and the
parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and
performance of the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to this
_Section 7.12_.

 

(g) This _Section 7.12_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained in this _Section 7.12_.

 

7.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of, and cooperate with Parent in
connection with, any shareholder litigation or claim against the Company
and/or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions; _provided_ , that the Company may, in its sole discretion,
enter into a settlement of any such shareholder litigation where the
aggregate amount of any such settlements does not exceed $250,000 and does not
involve the taking of any action other than the payment of monetary amounts;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that all obligations (other than consent to
settlement) in this _Section 7.13_ shall be subject to the obligations of the
Company under applicable laws relating to attorney-client communication and
privilege.

 

7.14 _Stock Exchange De-listing; Exchange Act De-registration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under applicable laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable
the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock from
Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no
more than ten (10) days after the Closing.

7.15 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Company Board and its compensation committee) will take
all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into by the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company prior
to, on or after the date of this Agreement with any of its officers,
directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such
officer, director or employee to be approved or ratified as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
under the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained

 



50  in this _Section 7.15_ shall permit the Company to take any action that
would be prohibited under any other provision of this Agreement, including
under any covenant or negative covenant set forth in _Section 7.1_ or
_Section 7.2_.

7.16 _Directors_.

 

(a) Promptly upon acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for,
any shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the Parent or
Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate, from time to time, such number of
persons for election or appointment to the Company Board as will give Merger
Sub representation on the Company Board equal to at least such number of
directors, rounded up to the nearest whole number, that is the product of (a)
the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the
directors elected or appointed pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) a
fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock so accepted for payment and paid for by Merger Sub plus
the number of shares of the Company Common Stock otherwise owned by Parent or
Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) the denominator of which
shall be the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding, and the
Company shall, at such time, cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected or
appointed; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Subs
designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective
Time the Company Board shall have at least three (3) directors who are
directors on the date of this Agreement and who will be independent for
purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (the " _Independent Directors_
"); _provided_ , _further_ , that, in such event, if the number of Independent
Directors shall be reduced below three (3) for any reason whatsoever, any
remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there shall be
only one (1) remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill such
vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other
directors shall designate three (3) persons to fill such vacancies who will be
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the
applicable stock exchange requirements, and such persons shall be deemed to
be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. The Companys
obligations under this _Section 7.16_ shall be subject to Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. Subject to applicable
law, the Company shall make commercially reasonable efforts to effect any such
election, including mailing to its shareholders the Information Statement
containing the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, and the Company shall make such mailing
with the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 ( _provided_ that Merger Sub shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis all information required to be
included in the Information Statement with respect to Merger Subs designees).
In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of
the Parent or Merger Sub, either increase the authorized number of directors
of the Company Board or use reasonable efforts to obtain the resignation of
such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable Merger Subs
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above.
At such time, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, take commercially
reasonable efforts to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the
number of members, rounded up to the nearest whole number, on (A) each
committee of the Company Board and (B) each board of directors of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries (and each committee thereof) that represents the same
percentage as such individuals represent on the Company Board in each case to
the extent permitted by applicable law or the rules of the Nasdaq.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Parents or Merger Subs designees constitute a majority of the Company Board
prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the Company
Board or the shareholders of the Company as may be required by the governing
documents of the Company or applicable law) be required for the Company (i) to
amend or terminate

 



51  this Agreement, (ii) to extend the time of performance of, or waive, any of
the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, or
to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies
hereunder, if such action would adversely affect the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger Sub), (iii) except as
expressly provided herein, to amend any governing document of the Company in
a manner that would reasonably be expected adversely to affect the holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger Sub), or (iv)
to take any other action or make any other determination of the Company Board
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions if such action
would reasonably be expected adversely to affect the holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger Sub). The
Independent Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Independent
Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company or the Company Board) and other advisors at the
expense of the Company as determined by the Independent Directors, and the
authority (acting as a committee of the Company Board, which hereby shall be
deemed to be constituted) to institute any action on behalf of the Company to
enforce performance of this Agreement.

 

7.17 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition," "business
combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover applicable
law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Offer, the acquisition of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Voting Agreements, the Merger or any other
Transaction, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their
respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to render such anti-takeover applicable law inapplicable to the
foregoing.

 

7.18 _Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate in connection with any financing sought to be obtained
by Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with effecting the
Transactions as may be reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , that
nothing in this _Section 7.18_ shall affect or negate
Parents representations and warranties contained in _Section 6.4_. Such
cooperation by the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) participation in a
reasonable number of meetings and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing

information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) facilitating the execution and delivery
at the Offer Closing of definitive documents related to any financing, (iv)

effective unless and until the Offer Closing occurs), and (v) obtaining
customary payoff letters, redemption notices, releases of Liens and
instruments of termination or discharge with respect to the
Companys indebtedness, including the indebtedness listed on _Section
5.2(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company hereby consents to the
reasonable use of its logos in connection with any financing, _provided_ that
such logos are not used in a manner that intentionally harms or disparages
the Company.

promptly notify the other of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

 



52 (b) any Actions, suits, claims, audits, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving

Section of this Agreement or that relate to the consummation of the
Transactions;

(d) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to cause the condition set forth in _Section
(ii)(d)_ of the Offer Conditions not to be satisfied;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.19_ shall not affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by any party hereunder or limit or otherwise affect the
conditions hereof or the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving
such notice.

reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement, unless a contrary
intention appears, (i) the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" and other
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular Article, Section or other subdivision, (ii) the word "including"
means "including without limitation" and is intended by the parties to be by
way of example rather than limitation, (iii) reference to any Article or
Section means such Article or Section hereof; (iv) whenever this Agreement
indicates that the Company has "made available," "provided" or "delivered" any

statement that such document was (A) delivered to Parent or Merger Sub with
acknowledged written receipt thereof or (B) made available (with separate
written notice to Parent or Merger Sub) for viewing online on the electronic
data site maintained by the Company in connection with the Transactions at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement; and (v)

any Person in the ordinary course of such Persons business that is consistent
with the past customs and practices of such Person in the normal day-to-day
operations of such Person. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement, and therefore no provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted or construed against any party hereto solely
because such party or its legal representative drafted such provision.

10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and annexes
hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and
the other documents and instruments referred to herein), together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 

10.5 _Assignment_. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each
other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after
the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that such transfer
or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Sub. Any assignment in violation of
the foregoing shall be null and void.

10.6 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED IN ALL RESPECTS,
INCLUDING VALIDITY, INTERPRETATION AND EFFECT, BY THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACHUSETTS APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS EXECUTED AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY
WITHIN SUCH STATE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF.

10.7 _Jurisdiction_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court, or if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware state court (the " _Relevant Courts_ ") for any litigation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (and agrees not to
commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Relevant
Courts and agrees not to plead

 



58  or claim in any Relevant Court that such litigation brought therein has been
brought in an inconvenient forum; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 10.7_ is intended to waive the right of any party to remove
any such Action or proceeding commenced in any such state court in the State
of Delaware to an appropriate federal court in the State of Delaware to the
extent the basis for such removal exists under applicable law. The parties
agree that the mailing by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, of any process required by any Relevant Court, to the address
specified in _Section 10.2_, shall constitute valid and lawful service of
process against them, without necessity for service by any other means
provided by statute or rule of court.

10.8  _Enforcement_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Relevant Courts, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that the party seeking such
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. In the event that any party seeks an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
injunction or other order, decree, ruling or judgment.

(b) Subject to the last paragraph of _Section 9.1_, the Company may pursue
any other remedy available to it at law or in equity, including monetary
damages, in the event of the willful breach by Parent or Merger Sub of this
Agreement or fraud on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, which damages Parent
and Merger Sub agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-
of-pocket costs; _provided_ , that it is agreed that neither this provision
nor any other provision in this Agreement is intended to provide the
Companys stockholders (or any party acting on their behalf other than the
Company) the ability to seek (whether in its capacity as a stockholder or
purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the
Company) the enforcement of, or directly seek any remedies pursuant to, this
Agreement, or otherwise create any rights in the Companys stockholders under
this Agreement or otherwise, including against the Company or its directors,
under any theory of law or equity, including under the applicable laws of
agency or the laws relating to the rights and obligations of third party
beneficiaries. For the avoidance of doubt as to the parties intent, the
determination of whether and how to terminate, amend, make any waiver or
consent under, or enforce this Agreement, and whether and how (if applicable)
to distribute any damages award to its stockholders, shall exclusively belong
to the Company (acting expressly through its Company Board) in its sole
discretion.

(c) The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by applicable law.

10.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic data file), each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by
electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) to the other parties.

 



59 10.10 _Parties In Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and except for _Section 7.12_
hereof, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other person other than the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

10.11 _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement be judicially
declared to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision will not have the
effect of invalidating or voiding the remainder of this Agreement, and the
part or parts of this Agreement so held to be invalid, unenforceable or void
will be deemed to have been stricken herefrom, and the remainder will have the
same force and effectiveness as if such stricken part or parts had never been
included herein. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

10.12 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES ANY RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHT UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED, OR
WHICH IN THE FUTURE MAY BE DELIVERED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS, AND
AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A
JURY.

10.13 _Disclaimer_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of such parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
_Section 9.4_ or _Exhibit B_  without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of such
parties. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

any time and from time to time.
