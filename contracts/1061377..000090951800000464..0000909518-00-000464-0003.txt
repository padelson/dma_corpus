to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend,
reverse stock split or similar event affecting the Parent Common Stock or the
Allscripts Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and the Closing)
(the "ChannelHealth Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time and

stock of the ChannelHealth Surviving Corporation.   (d) ChannelHealth Stock
Options. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall take such action as may be required to effect the following provisions
of this Section 2.2(d). As of the time of Closing each option to purchase
shares of ChannelHealth Common Stock (a "ChannelHealth Option") which is then
outstanding shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (an
"Assumed Option") to purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to (i) the number of shares of
ChannelHealth Common Stock subject to such option multiplied by (ii) the
ChannelHealth Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest penny) equal to (A) the former exercise
price per share of ChannelHealth Common Stock under such option immediately
prior to the Closing divided by (B) the ChannelHealth Exchange Ratio;
provided, however, that in the case of any ChannelHealth Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, the conversion formula shall be adjusted, if
necessary, to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as provided
above, the Assumed Options shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including expiration date, vesting and exercise provisions) as were
applicable to the converted ChannelHealth Option immediately prior to the
Closing. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Assumed Options appropriate notices setting forth
such holders\' rights pursuant to such Assumed Options, as amended by this
Section 2.2(d), and the agreements evidencing such Assumed Options shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
amendments provided for in this Section 2.2(d) and such notice). Parent shall
take such actions as are reasonably necessary for the assumption of the
ChannelHealth Options pursuant to this Section 2.2(d), including
the reservation, issuance and listing of shares of Parent Common Stock as
is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.2(d). Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-8 or other appropriate form with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to the Assumed Options as soon as practicable, and in
any event within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, and to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
covering such Assumed Options (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as any Assumed
Options remain outstanding.   (e) ChannelHealth Dissenting Shares.   (i)
For purposes of this Agreement, "ChannelHealth Dissenting Shares" means
shares of ChannelHealth Common Stock held as of the Effective Time by a
stockholder who has not voted such shares of ChannelHealth Common Stock in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the ChannelHealth   
6  Merger and with respect to which appraisal shall have been duly demanded
and perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and not
effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior to the Effective Time. ChannelHealth
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock, unless such stockholder shall have
forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under the DGCL or properly
withdrawn his, her or its demand for appraisal. If such stockholder has so
forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of ChannelHealth
Dissenting Shares, then (A) as of the occurrence of such event, such
holder\'s ChannelHealth Dissenting Shares shall cease to be ChannelHealth
Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such shares
of ChannelHealth Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(b), and (B) promptly
following the occurrence of such event, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent a certificate representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b).   (ii) ChannelHealth
shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of
any shares of ChannelHealth Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments that relate to such demands received by ChannelHealth
and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. ChannelHealth shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal of shares of ChannelHealth Common Stock
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.   2.3 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent, Allscripts and ChannelHealth shall enter into an agreement with such
bank or trust company as may be designated by Allscripts and ChannelHealth to
act as exchange agent for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the
applicable Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Allscripts Common Stock and
ChannelHealth Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II through
the Exchange Agent, Parent Certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange
for outstanding shares of Allscripts Common Stock and issuable pursuant to
Section 2.2 in exchange for outstanding shares of ChannelHealth Stock. Parent
Certificates deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "Exchange Fund". Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
from time to time as required after the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay
dividends and distributions in accordance with Section 2.3(c) and to make
payments in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.3(e).   (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares were converted into
the Allscripts Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, or the
ChannelHealth    7  Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2
(collectively, the "Merger Consideration"), (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Allscripts and ChannelHealth may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, certain
dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.3(c)
and cash in lieu of any fractional share in accordance with Section 2.3(e),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of ChannelHealth Stock that is not registered in
the transfer records of ChannelHealth, or of Allscripts Common Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of Allscripts, a Parent
Certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other non-income taxes required by reason
of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration that the holder thereof
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, if
applicable, certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.3(c) and, if applicable, cash in lieu of any fractional share in
accordance with Section 2.3(e). No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II.   (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with
a record date on or after the Closing Date shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(e), and all such
dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall
be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date on or after the Closing Date
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to    8  Section 2.3(e)
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Closing Date but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent
shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes.   (d)
No Further Ownership Rights in Allscripts Common Stock or ChannelHealth
Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued, and all cash paid, upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Allscripts Common
Stock or ChannelHealth Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates,
subject, however, to the applicable Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Closing Date that may have been authorized or made by Allscripts on such
shares of Allscripts Common Stock or by ChannelHealth on such shares of
ChannelHealth Stock that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
applicable Surviving Corporation of the shares of Allscripts Common Stock or
ChannelHealth Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
applicable Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, except as
otherwise provided by law.   (e) No Fractional Shares.   (i) No Parent
Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.   (ii) The Surviving Corporations
shall pay each former holder of Allscripts Common Stock or ChannelHealth
Stock, as applicable, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such former holder
(after taking into account all shares of Allscripts Common Stock or
ChannelHealth Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (B) the closing price for a share of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (the "Nasdaq") (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal, or, if not reported thereby, any
other authoritative source) on the first trading day following the Closing
Date.   (iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Allscripts Common Stock
and ChannelHealth Stock with respect to any fractional share interests, the
Exchange Agent will make available such amounts to such holders of Allscripts
Common Stock and ChannelHealth Common Stock subject to and in accordance with
the terms of Section 2.3(c).    9   (f) Termination of Exchange Fund.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the applicable Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (g) No
Liability. None of Parent, Allscripts, ChannelHealth or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration, any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to
this Article II or any dividends or distributions payable to the holder of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental body or authority) any such Merger Consideration or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.   (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent.   2.4 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the related Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the related Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration and, if applicable, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and
unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, in each case pursuant to this Agreement.  
2.5 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporations and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Allscripts Common Stock
or ChannelHealth Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by either of the
Surviving Corporations or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Allscripts Common Stock or ChannelHealth Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by either of
the Surviving Corporations or Parent, as the case may be.    10   2.6

the ChannelHealth Stockholders on or before March 31, 2003 (the "Earnout
Date"), if the following conditions are satisfied:   (i) if the Gross
Qualifying Revenues (as defined below) to Parent, or any Affiliate of Parent
from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 (the "Earnout Revenue") is greater
than or equal to $180 million but less than or equal to $210 million, .04131
additional shares of Parent Common Stock for each share of ChannelHealth
Stock held at the Effective Time (subject to equitable adjustment in the

event affecting the Parent Common Stock or the Allscripts Common Stock
between the date of this Agreement and the Earnout Date);   (ii) if Earnout
Revenue is greater than $210 million,  .06278 additional shares of Parent
Common Stock for each share of ChannelHealth Stock held at the Effective Time
(subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock
dividend, reverse stock split or similar event affecting the Parent Common
Stock or the Allscripts Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and
the Earnout Date);   (iii) if Earnout Revenue is less than $180 million,
no additional shares of Parent Common Stock; or   (iv) if, prior to
December 31, 2002, Parent sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of, or

substantially all of its business or intellectual property related to
physician-focused, internet based services that automate clinical, financial

each ChannelHealth Stockholder and representing a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to such ChannelHealth Stockholder\'s percentage interest
in the Earnout Shares, which percentage interests shall be based upon each
holder\'s pro rata interest in all shares of ChannelHealth Stock issued and

issued pursuant to this Section 3.1(a), and in lieu thereof the ChannelHealth
Stockholders entitled thereto will be paid cash for their fractional share
interests pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(e).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no ChannelHealth Stockholder

purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the respective
meanings set forth below:   (i) "Gross Qualifying Revenues" means revenues
from Qualifying Sales (as defined below) which are recognized by Parent or
any Affiliate of Parent in accordance with GAAP, prior to any reductions of
any kind, including reductions of commissions paid to IDX.   (ii)
"Qualifying Sales" are sales generated from the service lines set forth on
Schedule 3.1(b)(ii), less the commissions payable to IDX set forth on such
Schedule.   (c) Parent will report Gross Qualifying Revenues to
the Stockholders\' Representative on a monthly basis during the period from
January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 not later than 30 days after the

days written notice, up to four times per year, the Stockholders\'
Representative shall have the right at its expense to have reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to inspect the books and records of Parent and
any Affiliate of Parent relating to Gross Qualifying Revenues for the limited
purpose of verifying Parent\'s compliance with this Article III. Parent shall
make such books and records available at its offices in Libertyville,
Illinois and such books and records shall be made available in the manner
which they are regularly maintained by Parent. In addition, at the request of
the Stockholders\' Representative in accordance with this Section 3.1(c),
Parent shall also make photocopies of such books and records available at
IDX\'s primary Vermont office for inspection by the Stockholders\'
Representative.    14   (d) Following receipt from Parent of the final
report of Gross Qualifying Revenues as provided in Section 3.1(c), the
Stockholders\' Representative shall have a period of 20 days after delivery
to present in writing to Parent any objections thereto, which objections
shall be set forth in reasonable detail. If no objections are raised within
such 20-day period, the report shall be deemed accepted and approved by the
Stockholders\' Representative. However, in the event of a dispute, the
parties shall follow the procedures set forth in Sections 5.1(c) and
5.1(e).   3.2 Registration of Earnout Shares. If any Earnout Shares are

five business days following the Earnout Date, a non-exclusive
"shelf" registration statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
covering the resale to the public by the holders of all of the Earnout Shares
on a continuous basis (the "Earnout Registration Statement"). The
Earnout Registration Statement will be on Form S-3 unless Parent ceases to be
eligible to register the Earnout Shares for resale on such Form, in which
case such registration will be on another appropriate form in accordance
herewith. Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the Earnout Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as practicable
after the filing thereof. Parent shall cause the Earnout Registration
Statement to remain effective until the second anniversary of the filing
thereof or such earlier time as all of the Earnout Shares covered by the
Earnout Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto.   3.3
Registration Procedures. In connection with Parent\'s registration
obligations hereunder, Parent will:   (a) Not less than two business days
prior to the filing of the Earnout Registration Statement, or any related
prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto (but excluding any documents
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference), furnish to each
ChannelHealth Stockholder and its counsel copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed, which documents (other than those incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of each
ChannelHealth Stockholder and its counsel. Parent will in good faith seek to
address any questions or issues raised by any ChannelHealth Stockholder or
its counsel as a result of such review.   (b) (i) Prepare and file with the
Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, as may be
necessary to keep the Earnout Registration Statement continuously effective
for resale of all of the Earnout Shares; (ii) cause the prospectus included
therein to be amended or supplemented as required; (iii) promptly provide
each ChannelHealth Stockholder and its counsel with copies of all

filed; (ii) on    15  effectiveness of the Earnout Registration Statement
or any post-effective amendment; (iii) of any request by the Commission, or
other federal or state governmental authority, for amendments or supplements
to the Earnout Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional
information; (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Earnout Registration Statement or the
initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (v) of the receipt by Parent
of any notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or
exemption from qualification of any of the Earnout Shares for sale in any
jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such
purpose; and (vi) of the occurrence of any event that makes any statement
made in the Earnout Registration Statement or prospectus or any document
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any
material respect or that requires any revisions to the Earnout Registration
Statement, prospectus or other documents so that such document will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.   (d) Furnish to each ChannelHealth Stockholder and
its counsel without charge (i) at least one conformed copy of each
Earnout Registration Statement and amendment thereto, including financial
statements and schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference, and all exhibits to the extent requested
reasonably promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission,
and (ii) as many copies of the prospectus or prospectuses (including each
form of prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons
may reasonably request; and Parent hereby consents to the use of such
prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by the ChannelHealth
Stockholders and any underwriters in connection with the offering and sale of
the Earnout Shares covered by such prospectus and any amendment or supplement
thereto.   (e) Use its best efforts to register or qualify the
Earnout Shares covered by the Earnout Registration Statement under the
securities laws of each jurisdiction as any ChannelHealth Stockholder may
reasonably request; provided, however that Parent will not be required in
connection with this paragraph (e) to qualify as a foreign corporation or
execute a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.   (f)
If Parent has delivered preliminary or final prospectuses to the
ChannelHealth Stockholders and after having done so the prospectus is amended
to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, promptly notify each
ChannelHealth Stockholder and promptly provide each ChannelHealth Stockholder
with revised or supplemented prospectuses.   (g) Pay the following expenses
incurred in complying with Sections 3.2 and 3.3: all registration and filing
fees, exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of counsel for Parent, and
fees and expenses of accountants for Parent, but excluding any brokerage
fees, selling commissions or    16  underwriting discounts and legal fees
incurred by each ChannelHealth Stockholder in connection with sales under the
Earnout Registration Statement.   3.4 Requirements of ChannelHealth
Stockholders. Each ChannelHealth Stockholder shall furnish to Parent in
writing such information regarding such ChannelHealth Stockholder and the
proposed sale of Earnout Shares by such ChannelHealth Stockholder as is
required by law to be disclosed in the Earnout Registration Statement.  
3.5 Indemnification and Contribution.   (a) Indemnification by Parent.
Parent will indemnify and hold harmless each ChannelHealth Stockholder, its
agents (including any underwriters retained by such ChannelHealth Stockholder
in connection with the offer and sale of Earnout Shares) and any directors,
officers and employees of any such Person, each Person who controls any such
Person (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and
the directors, officers, agents and employees of each such controlling
Person, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against
any and all debts, obligations and other liabilities, monetary damages,
fines, fees, penalties, interest obligations, deficiencies, losses, costs and
expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys\' fee and
expenses) (collectively, "Damages") arising out of or relating to any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Earnout
Registration Statement, any prospectus or any form of prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising
out of or relating to any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of any prospectus or form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, except
to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statements or
omissions are based solely upon information regarding such ChannelHealth
Stockholder furnished in writing to Parent by such ChannelHealth Stockholder
expressly for use therein or by such ChannelHealth Stockholder\'s failure to
deliver a copy of the Earnout Registration Statement or prospectus
or amendment or supplement thereto. Parent will notify each
ChannelHealth Stockholder promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of
any proceeding of which Parent is aware in connection with the subject matter
of this Section 3.5.   (b) Indemnification by the ChannelHealth
Stockholders. Each ChannelHealth Stockholder will indemnify and hold harmless
Parent, the directors, officers, agents and employees of Parent, each person
who controls Parent (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act

employees of each such controlling Person, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, from and against any and all Damages arising solely out of or
relating solely to any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Earnout Registration Statement, any prospectus or any form
of prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising solely out of or relating solely to any omission or
alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any prospectus or
form of prospectus or supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information
regarding such ChannelHealth    17  Stockholder so furnished in writing
by such ChannelHealth Stockholder to Parent specifically for inclusion in the
Earnout Registration Statement or such prospectus. In no event will the
liability of any ChannelHealth Stockholder hereunder be greater in amount
than the net proceeds actually received by such ChannelHealth Stockholder
from the sale of Earnout Shares pursuant to the Earnout Registration
Statement. Each ChannelHealth Stockholder will notify Parent promptly of the
institution, threat or assertion of any proceeding of which such
ChannelHealth Stockholder is aware in connection with the subject matter of
this Section 3.5.   (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. A
party entitled, or seeking to assert rights, to indemnification under this
Section 3.5 (an "Indemnified Party") shall give written notification to the
party from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party") of the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a third-party
claim for which indemnification pursuant to this Section 3.5 may be sought
or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such claim by a third party. Such
notification shall be given within 20 days after receipt by the Indemnified
Party of notice of such action, suit, proceeding or claim, and shall describe
(to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the
basis for such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the amount of the
claimed damages; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except to the
extent the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced. Within 30 days after
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written
notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of
such action, suit, proceeding or claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume
control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense.
The Party not controlling such defense (the "Non-controlling Party") may
participate therein at its own expense; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to
such action, suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be considered "Damages" for purposes
of this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying
Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel per
jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such defense
(the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the
status of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect
thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with
such information as it may have with respect to such action, suit, proceeding
or claim (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which
may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice,
billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of
such action, suit, proceeding or claim.    18  The Indemnifying Party
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such action, suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a
complete release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect
thereto or that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to
any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party.   (d) Contribution. If a claim for indemnification
under Section 3.5(a) or 3.5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party because
of a failure or refusal of a governmental authority to enforce such
indemnification in accordance with its terms (by reason of public policy or
otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been
taken or made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying
Party or Indemnified Party, and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action,
statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
any losses shall be deemed to include any reasonable attorneys\' or
other reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with
any proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such
fees or expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section 3.5 was
available to such party in accordance with its terms.   The Parties hereto
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to
this Section 3.5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other
method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.5(d), no ChannelHealth
Stockholder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the net proceeds actually received by such
ChannelHealth Stockholder from the sale of Earnout Shares pursuant to the
Earnout Registration Statement exceeds the amount of any damages that such
ChannelHealth Stockholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.   (e) The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 3.5 are in
addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the
Indemnified Parties.    19   3.6 Registrations on behalf of Other
Holders. Parent may, at its election, include securities of other holders of
Parent\'s securities in the Earnout Registration Statement.   3.7
Assignment of Rights. No ChannelHealth Stockholder may assign any of its
rights under Section 3.2 through 3.7 except in connection with the transfer
of some or all of its Earnout Shares to a child or spouse, or trust or other
entity for their benefit; provided, however, each such transferee agrees in a
written instrument delivered to Parent to be bound by the provisions of
Section 3.2 through 3.7. Any such permitted transferee shall be deemed to
be a "ChannelHealth Stockholder" for purposes of Section 3.2 through 3.7  
3.8 Blackouts. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, it
is understood and agreed that Parent shall not be required to keep any
Earnout Registration Statement effective or useable for offers and sales of
the Earnout Shares, file a post effective amendment to an
Earnout Registration Statement or any prospectus supplement or to supplement
or amend any Earnout Registration Statement, if Parent is then involved in
discussions concerning, or otherwise engaged in, any material financing,
offering or investment, acquisition or divestiture transaction or other
material business purpose if Parent determines in good faith that the making
of such a filing, supplement or amendment at such time would interfere with
such transaction or purpose. Parent shall promptly give the holders of
Earnout Shares written notice of such postponement containing a general
statement of the reasons for such postponement and an approximation of the
anticipated delay. Upon receipt by a holder of Earnout Shares of notice of an
event of the kind described in this Section 3.8, such holder shall forthwith
discontinue such holder\'s disposition of Earnout Shares until such holder\'s
receipt of notice from Parent that such disposition may continue and of any
supplemented or amended prospectus indicated in such notice. Parent shall use
its reasonable efforts to permit sales of Earnout Shares on such shelf
registration statement for at least 180 days during any 360-day period.  
Article IV   RETENTION OF ASSETS   4.1 Assets Retained by IDX.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
specifically understood and agreed that the assets of ChannelHealth
identified on Schedule 4.1 hereto shall be assigned, sold, conveyed,
transferred and delivered by ChannelHealth to IDX on or before the Closing
Date as contemplated by the ChannelHealth/IDX Asset Purchase Agreement and
shall not be included in the properties or assets of ChannelHealth acquired
by Parent through the ChannelHealth Merger (the "Retained Assets").   
20   Article V   ACCRUED LIABILITIES ADJUSTMENT   5.1 Adjustment to
ChannelHealth Cash Reserves.   (a) As soon as practicable following the
Closing Date and in any event within 60 days of the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause the ChannelHealth Surviving Corporation to prepare and deliver to
Parent and the Stockholders\' Representative a balance sheet of ChannelHealth
as at the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance
Sheet"). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be audited and certified by
Ernst and Young LLP, ChannelHealth\'s regular independent certified public
accountants ("ChannelHealth\'s Accountants"), shall be based upon the books
and records of ChannelHealth, shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding fiscal year, and
shall present fairly the financial position of ChannelHealth as at the
Closing Date. All accruals as at the Closing Date which, in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with ChannelHealth\'s practice of the
preceding fiscal year, should be reflected on a balance sheet, shall be
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, including, without limitation,
with respect to such items as employee bonuses, profit-sharing plan
contributions and promotional expenses. Allscripts\'s regular independent
public accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("Allscripts\'s Accountants")
and the Stockholders\' Representative\'s regular independent
public accountants, Ernst and Young LLP (the "Stockholders\'
Representative\'s Accountants"), shall each have the opportunity to observe
the taking of inventories in connection with the preparation of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet, to consult with and to examine the work papers, schedules
and other documents prepared or reviewed by ChannelHealth\'s Accountants in
connection with the preparation of their report and of the Accrued
Liabilities Certificate referred to in Section 5.1(b).   (b) "Accrued
Liabilities" shall be the accounts payable, other current liabilities and
accrued liabilities of ChannelHealth as reflected on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet; provided, however, the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall not include
accrued liabilities relating to Taxes for which IDX is indemnifying
Allscripts pursuant to Article XI.   The calculation of Accrued Liabilities
shall be made by ChannelHealth\'s Accountants, who shall render a certificate
(the "Accrued Liabilities Certificate") showing such calculation and stating
that such calculation has been made in accordance with the provisions of this
Article V. The Accrued Liabilities Certificate shall be delivered to Parent
and IDX as soon as practicable following the Closing Date but in no event
later than 90 days thereafter.   (c) Each of Parent and IDX shall have a
period of 20 days after delivery of Accrued Liabilities Certificate to
present in writing to ChannelHealth\'s Accountants (with a copy to the other
party) any objections Parent or IDX, as the case may be, may have to any of
the matters set forth therein, which objections shall be set forth in
reasonable detail. If no objections are raised within such 20-day period, the
Accrued Liabilities    21  Certificate shall be deemed accepted and
approved by Parent and by IDX, and appropriate payment shall be made as
contemplated by Section 5.2(d)   If IDX shall raise any objections within
such 20-day period, ChannelHealth\'s Accountants and Parent\'s Accountants
shall attempt to resolve the matter or matters in dispute and, if resolved,
such firms shall send a joint notice to Parent and IDX stating the manner in
which the dispute was resolved, ChannelHealth\'s Accountants shall send to
Parent and IDX a confirmation of the original Accrued Liabilities Certificate
or, if necessary, a revised Accrued Liabilities Certificate prepared in
accordance with such resolution, and Parent\'s Accountants shall send a
letter to Parent and IDX confirming that such confirmed or revised Accrued
Liabilities Certificate is in accordance with such resolution, whereupon the
confirmed or revised Accrued Liabilities Certificate shall be final and
binding on the parties hereto and payment shall be made as contemplated by
Section 5.2(d) within five business days following the receipt of such
documents by IDX and Allscripts.   If such dispute cannot be resolved by
Parent and IDX or by such accounting firms within 40 days after the delivery
of the Accrued Liabilities Certificate, then the specific matters in dispute
shall be submitted to Arthur Andersen LLP, or, if such firm declines to act
in such capacity, such other firm of independent public accountants mutually
acceptable to Parent and IDX, which firm shall make a final and binding
determination as to such matter or matters. Arthur Andersen LLP or such other
accounting firm shall send its written determination to Parent, IDX,
ChannelHealth\'s Accountants and Parent\'s Accountants. ChannelHealth\'s
Accountants shall then send to Parent and IDX a confirmation of the original
Accrued Liabilities Certificate or, if necessary, a revised Accrued
Liabilities Certificate prepared in accordance with such determination, and
Parent\'s Accountants shall send a letter to Parent and IDX confirming that
such confirmed or revised Accrued Liabilities Certificate is in accordance
with such determination, whereupon the confirmed or revised
Accrued Liabilities Certificate shall be binding on the parties hereto and
payment shall be made as contemplated by Section 5.2(d) within five business
days following the receipt of such documents by Parent and IDX.   The
parties agree to cooperate with each other and each other\'s authorized
representatives and with Arthur Andersen LLP or any other accounting firm
selected by Parent and IDX in order that any and all matters in dispute shall
be resolved as soon as practicable and that a final determination of the
Accrued Liabilities shall be made.   (d) If the amount of the Accrued
Liabilities shall exceed Cash Reserves (as defined below) of ChannelHealth as
reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, IDX shall pay to Parent, by the
delivery to Parent of a certified or bank cashier\'s check in New York
Clearing House funds, payable to the order of Parent or, at Parent\'s option,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent, the amount of such excess. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cash
Reserves" shall mean cash and cash equivalents as reflected on the Closing
Date Balance Sheet.    22   (e) The fees and expenses hereunder of
ChannelHealth\'s Accountants shall be paid by IDX, those of Parent\'s
Accountants shall be paid by Parent and those of Arthur Andersen LLP or any
other accounting firm selected by Parent and IDX pursuant to Section 5.1(c)
above shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half by IDX.   5.2
Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing as follows:   (a) At the election of IDX or Allscripts on or
after December 31, 2000, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the close
of business on such date, provided that the terminating party is not in
default of any of its obligations hereunder;   (b) by mutual written
consent of IDX and Allscripts; or   (c) by IDX or Allscripts if there shall
be in effect a final Order of a Governmental Body of competent jurisdiction
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   5.3 Procedure Upon Termination. In the
event of termination by Allscripts or IDX, or both, pursuant to Section 5.2
hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party or
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate, and the Mergers contemplated
hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Allscripts, IDX or
any other party hereto. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein
each party shall redeliver all documents, work papers and other material of
any other party relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the party furnishing the
same.   5.4 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated as provided herein, then each of the parties shall
be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date of such termination and such termination shall be without
liability to any such party; provided, however, that the obligations of the
parties set forth in Section 12.3 hereof and in the Non-Disclosure and Non-
Use Agreement dated April 26, 2000 between IDX and Allscripts shall survive
any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder; provided, further,
however, that nothing in this Section 5.4 shall relieve any party hereto of
any liability for a breach of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VI-A

Allscripts and Parent are in compliance with all laws applicable to them or
to the conduct of their respective businesses or operations or the use of
their properties (including any leased properties and assets), except for

financial condition of Allscripts, Parent and their respective subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Each of Parent and Allscripts has all governmental permits
and approvals from state, federal or local authorities which are required for

effect on the business, properties, results of operations or financial
condition of Allscripts, Parent and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.   7.13 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The

Procedures.   (a) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall
be instituted or that any claim or demand ("Claim") shall be asserted by any
Person in respect of which payment may be sought under Section 11.1 hereof,
the indemnified party shall reasonably and promptly cause written notice of
the assertion of any Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by
this indemnity to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying
party shall have the right, at its sole option and expense, to be represented
by counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against hereunder. If
the indemnifying    62  party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified
against hereunder, it shall within five days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Claim so requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so. If
the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against
hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified party of its election as herein
provided or contests its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party for
such Losses under this Agreement, the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Claim. If the indemnified party
defends any Claim, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the
indemnified party for the Expenses of defending such Claim upon submission of
periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the defense of any
Claim, the indemnified party may participate, at his or its own expense, in
the defense of such Claim; provided, however, that such indemnified party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the indemnifying party if, so requested by the indemnifying
party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
indemnified party, a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and provided, further, that the indemnifying party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for
all indemnified parties in connection with any Claim. The parties hereto
agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such Claim. The indemnified party shall not
agree to such settlement of any such Legal Proceeding or Claim without the
prior written consent of the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall
have full discretion to agree to any settlement of any such Legal Proceeding
or Claim; provided, however, that the indemnifying party may not agree to any
settlement of such Legal Proceeding or Claim that does not include a release
of the indemnified party from all liability with respect thereto without the
prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (b) After any final judgment or
award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the
time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have
arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to a Claim hereunder,
the indemnified party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any
sums due and owing by the indemnifying party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to such matter and the indemnifying party shall be required to pay
all of the sums so due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within 10 business days after the date of such
notice.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, IDX shall continue to defend
the Claim comprising the ChannelHealth Litigation until such Claim
is disposed of as described in Section 11.2(b).   (d) The failure of the
indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Claim shall not
release, waive or otherwise affect the indemnifying party\'s obligations with
respect thereto except to the extent that    63  the indemnifying party
can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice as a result of such failure.  
11.3 Tax Matters.   (a) Tax Indemnification. IDX agrees to be responsible
for and to indemnify and hold the Allscripts Indemnified Parties harmless
from and against any and all Taxes that may be imposed upon or assessed
against ChannelHealth or the assets thereof:   (A) with respect to all
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date;   (B) with respect
to any and all Taxes of ChannelHealth for the period allocated to IDX
pursuant to Section 11.3(b)(iv);   (C) arising by reason of any breach by
ChannelHealth or any inaccuracy of any of the representations contained in
Section 6.10 hereof;   (D) by reason of being a successor-in-interest
or transferee of another entity;   (E) with respect to any and all Taxes of
any member of a consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
ChannelHealth (or any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, by reason of the liability of ChannelHealth pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6(a) or any analogous or similar state,
local or foreign Law or regulation; and   (F) by reason of the transactions
contemplated by Article IV hereof.  IDX shall also pay and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Allscripts Indemnified Parties from and against any
losses, damages, liabilities, obligations, deficiencies, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable expenses and fees for attorneys
and accountants) ("Related Costs") incurred in connection with the Taxes for
which IDX is responsible to indemnify the Allscripts Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this Section 11.3(a) (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand,
action, suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment, including the defense or
settlement thereof, relating to such Taxes) or the enforcement of this
Section 11.3(a).   (b) Preparation of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.   (i)
IDX shall (A) include ChannelHealth and (where applicable) any of its
Subsidiaries in (1) the U.S. consolidated federal income Tax Returns of IDX
required to be filed after the date hereof for all taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date and (2) where applicable, all combined
consolidated or unitary Tax Returns that are required to be filed by IDX for
any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date and (B) cause   
64  ChannelHealth to file all Tax Returns required to be filed by
ChannelHealth on or prior to the Closing Date. IDX shall pay any and all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns. All Tax Returns described in this
Section 11.3(b)(i) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior
practice unless a past practice has been finally determined to be incorrect
by the applicable taxing authority or a contrary treatment is required by
applicable tax Laws (or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof).
IDX shall cause ChannelHealth to provide Allscripts with copies of such
completed Tax Returns at least 10 days prior to the filing date, and
Allscripts shall be provided an opportunity to review such Tax Returns and
supporting workpapers and Schedules prior to the filing of such Tax Returns.
The failure of Allscripts to propose any changes to any such Tax Return
within such 10 days shall be deemed to be an indication of its approval
thereof. IDX and Allscripts shall attempt in good faith mutually to resolve
any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns prior to the due date for filing
thereof. Any disagreements regarding such Tax Returns which are not resolved
prior to the filing thereof shall be promptly resolved pursuant to Section
11.3(f) which shall be binding on the parties.   (ii) Following the Closing,
Allscripts shall be responsible for preparing or causing to be prepared all
federal, foreign, state and local Tax Returns required to be filed by
ChannelHealth after the Closing Date.   (iii) Not later than five days
before the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Returns
which Allscripts has the responsibility to file, IDX shall pay to Allscripts
an amount equal to that portion of the Taxes shown on such return for which
IDX has an obligation to indemnify Allscripts and its Affiliates pursuant to
the provisions of Section 11.3(a).   (iv) For federal income Tax purposes,
the taxable year of ChannelHealth shall end as of the close of the Closing
Date and, with respect to all other Taxes, IDX and Allscripts will, unless
prohibited by applicable law, close the taxable period of ChannelHealth as of
the close of the Closing Date. Neither IDX nor Allscripts shall take any
position inconsistent with the preceding sentence on any Tax Return. In any
case where applicable law does not permit ChannelHealth to close its taxable
year on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with
respect to a taxable period which includes the Closing Date (but does not
begin or end on that day), then Taxes, if any, attributable to the taxable
period of ChannelHealth beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
shall be allocated (i) to IDX for the period up to and including the Closing
Date, and (ii) to Allscripts for the period subsequent to the Closing Date.
Any allocation of income or deductions required to determine any Taxes
attributable to any period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
shall be prepared by Allscripts and shall be made by means of a closing of
the books and records of ChannelHealth as of the close of the Closing Date,
provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and    65  the period after the Closing Date in proportion
to the number of days in each such period. Allscripts shall provide IDX with
a schedule showing the computation of the allocation at least 30 days prior
to the due date for filing a Tax Return which includes the Closing Date. IDX
shall have the right to review such schedule, and Allscripts and IDX shall
attempt in good faith mutually to resolve any disagreements regarding the
determination of such allocation. Any disagreements regarding such
determination shall be resolved pursuant to Section 11.3(f). Any amount owing
from IDX under this Section 11.3(b)(iv) shall be paid no later than five days
prior to the filing of the underlying Tax Return.   (v) With respect to any
Tax Returns required to be filed by Allscripts with respect to any taxable
period of ChannelHealth ending on or before the Closing Date, Allscripts
shall provide IDX with a copy of such completed Tax Returns at least 10 days
prior to the due date for filing of such Tax Returns. IDX shall have the
right to review such Tax Returns, and Allscripts and IDX shall attempt in
good faith mutually to resolve any disagreements regarding the preparation
thereof prior to filing thereof. The failure of IDX to propose any changes to
any such Tax Return within such 10 days shall be deemed to be an indication
of its approval thereof. Any disagreements regarding such determination shall
be resolved pursuant to Section 11.3(f). If such disagreement cannot be
resolved prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return, Allscripts may
cause such Tax Return to be filed in the manner proposed by Allscripts,
without prejudice to IDX\'s right to pursue a final resolution of such
disagreement. Any amount owing from IDX under this Section 11.3(b)(v)
shall be paid no later than five days prior to the filing of the underlying
Tax Return.   (c) Cooperation with Respect to Tax Returns. Allscripts
and IDX agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, and each at
their own expense, as promptly as practicable, such information (including
access to books and records) and assistance, including making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanations of any material provided, relating to ChannelHealth as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation
for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to
Taxes. Allscripts or ChannelHealth shall retain in its possession, and shall
provide IDX reasonable access to (including the right to make copies of),
such supporting books and records and any other materials that IDX may
specify with respect to Tax matters relating to any taxable period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date until the relevant statute of limitations has
expired. After such time, Allscripts may dispose of such material, provided
that prior to such disposition Allscripts shall give IDX a reasonable
opportunity to take possession of such materials.   (d) Carrybacks. IDX
shall pay to Allscripts the amount of any Tax benefit (including interest
thereon) realized by IDX or any Affiliate thereof as a result of the
carryback of any Tax loss, deduction or credit of ChannelHealth from any
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date to a taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date. IDX shall pay such amount to Allscripts within 10
business days after such Tax benefit is realized by IDX    66  or any
Affiliate of it as a refund or otherwise, provided that Allscripts
shall return to IDX the amount, if any, by which the amount of such Tax
benefit is thereafter reduced pursuant to a final determination.   (e)
Transfer Taxes. IDX shall be liable for and shall pay (and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Allscripts against) all sales, use, stamp, documentary,
filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or governmental charges
(including, without limitation, real property transfer gains Taxes, UCC-3
filing fees, FAA, ICC, DOT, real estate and motor vehicle registration, title
recording or filing fees and other amounts payable in respect of transfer
filings) as levied by any taxing authority or governmental agency in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than
Taxes measured by or with respect to income imposed on Allscripts or
its Affiliates). IDX hereby agree to file all necessary Documents (including,
but not limited to, all Tax Returns) with respect to all such amounts in a
timely manner.   (f) Dispute Resolution. Any dispute as to any
matter covered hereby shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm
mutually acceptable to IDX and Allscripts. The fees and expenses of such
accounting firm shall be borne equally by IDX and Allscripts.   (g) Sole
Remedy. The indemnification provided for in this Section 11.3 shall be the
sole remedy for any claim in respect of Taxes and the provisions of Sections
11.1 through 11.2 hereof shall not apply to such claims.   (h) Survival. Any
claim for indemnity under this Section 11.3 may be made at any time prior to
60 days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations
with respect to the relevant taxable period (including all periods of
extension, whether automatic of permissive).   (i) Certain Representations.

result of any Claim made with respect to employment prior to or on the
Closing Date with ChannelHealth including, without limitation, any Claim with
respect to, relating to arising out of or in connection with discrimination
by ChannelHealth or wrongful discharge (including constructive discharge)
prior to the Closing Date.   11.5 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. IDX
and Allscripts agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this
Article XI as an adjustment to the consideration paid hereunder for federal,
state, local and foreign income Tax purposes. If any indemnification payment
under Article XI (including, without limitation, this Section 11.5) is
determined to be taxable to Allscripts or ChannelHealth by any taxing
authority, IDX shall also indemnify Allscripts or ChannelHealth for any Taxes
incurred by reason of the receipt of such payment and any Related Costs
incurred by Allscripts or ChannelHealth in connection with such Taxes (or any
asserted deficiency, claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, judgment or
assessment, including the defense or settlement thereof, relating to such
Taxes).   11.6 Limitations.   (a) Except with respect to Claims based on
actual fraud, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Article XI

respective Affiliates with respect to Claims resulting from or relating to
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the
transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, in no event shall any party hereto, nor
its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission
of the transactions consummated under this Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the following
three limitations shall apply:   (i) the aggregate liability of IDX for the
sum of all Losses under Sections 11.1(a)(i), (iii), (v), (vi) and (vii)
(insofar as the Expenses referred to therein relate to Losses arising under
Sections 11.1(a)(i), (iii), (v) or (vi)) and clause (ii) of Section 11.4
shall not exceed $50 million;   (ii) the aggregate liability of Allscripts
for the sum of all Losses under Sections 11.1(b)(ii) (excluding Losses
arising from a breach of Section 11.3(i)), (iii) and (v) (insofar as the
Expenses referred to therein relate to Losses arising under Sections
11.1(b)(ii) or (iii)) shall not exceed    68  $50 million; provided,
however, any issuance of Earnout Shares shall not be counted against such
amount; and   (iii) IDX shall not be liable for any individual Loss
under Sections 11.1(a)(i), (iii), (v), (vi) or (vii) (insofar as the Expenses
referred to therein relate to Losses arising under Sections 11.1(a)(i),
(iii), (v) or (vi)) and clause (ii) of Section 11.4 unless such Loss exceeds
$50,000 and IDX shall not be liable for any such individual Losses in excess
of $50,000 unless and until the aggregate amount of such individual Losses in
excess of $50,000 exceeds $1 million (it being understood that in such case
IDX shall be liable only for the amount of such Losses in excess of
$500,000).   (c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be
responsible and liable for any Losses or other amounts under this Article XI
that are consequential, in the nature of lost profits, diminution in value,
damage to reputation or the like, special or punitive or otherwise not actual
Losses. Allscripts shall (and shall cause the ChannelHealth Surviving
Corporation to) use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all legal
rights and remedies available in order to minimize the Losses for which
indemnification is provided to Allscripts by IDX under Article XI.   (d)
The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article XI shall be reduced by any related recoveries to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled under insurance policies or other related
payments received or receivable from third parties and any tax
benefits actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
or for which the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates is eligible on
account of the matter resulting in such Losses or the payment of such
Losses.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the amount of any Losses for which indemnification by IDX is provided under
this Article XI shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves
or provisions reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet.   (f) Effective
as of the Effective Time, each of Parent and Allscripts hereby waives and
releases (and shall cause the ChannelHealth Surviving Corporation to waive
and release), any claim ChannelHealth may have against IDX, except (i) any
claims or rights hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement and (ii) any
claims or rights under the ChannelHealth/IDX Asset Purchase Agreement.
Effective as of the Effective Time, IDX hereby waives and releases any claim

83   EXHIBIT A-1   VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY   THIS VOTING
AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY (the "Agreement"), dated as of July 13, 2000,
between IDX Systems Corporation, a Vermont corporation (the "Stockholder"),
who is a Stockholder of Channelhealth Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), and Allscripts, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Buyer").   WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Company, the Stockholder, the Buyer, Allscripts Holding, Inc.,
Bursar Acquisition, Inc. and Bursar Acquisition No. 2, Inc. have entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended from time to
time, the "Merger Agreement"), providing for the acquisition of the Company
by the Buyer, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
(the "Merger"); and   WHEREAS, the Stockholder owns of record and
beneficially the number of shares of capital stock of the Company set forth
beneath its signature below (the "Shares"); and   WHEREAS, the Stockholder
wishes to enter into this Agreement with respect to all of the Shares and all
of the shares of the Company\'s capital stock which the Stockholder acquires
during the term of this Agreement or as to which it has, directly or
indirectly, the right to vote or direct the voting of (collectively, the
"Proxy Shares"); and   WHEREAS, approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the Company\'s Stockholders is a condition to the consummation
of the Merger; and   WHEREAS, in order to induce the Buyer to enter into the
Merger Agreement, the Stockholder has agreed, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, to vote the Proxy Shares and to deliver
an irrevocable proxy to the Buyer to vote the Proxy Shares at any meeting of
the Company\'s Stockholders or in connection with any action by consent of
the Company\'s Stockholders, in favor of the approval and adoption of the
Merger Agreement and in favor of the approval of the Merger.  Capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed
to such terms in the Merger Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1. Agreement to
Vote Shares. The Stockholder agrees during the term of this Agreement to vote
the Proxy Shares, in person or by proxy (or by written consent if action is
taken by written consent) in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and in favor of the approval of the Merger at any meeting of the
Stockholders of the Company (or any written action in lieu of a meeting) at
which such matters are considered and at every adjournment thereof. The
Stockholder agrees with respect to the Proxy Shares, not to, and not
to permit any of its Affiliates to, vote or execute any written consent in
lieu of a stockholders meeting or vote of the Company, if such consent or
vote by the Stockholders of the Company would be inconsistent with or
frustrate the purposes of the other agreements of the Stockholder pursuant to
this paragraph. The parties acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any shares of the Company\'s
capital stock sold or otherwise    transferred by Indy in connection with
the ChannelHealth/IDX Asset Purchase Agreement shall not be subject to the
provisions of this Agreement.   2. Irrevocable Proxy. The Stockholder hereby
irrevocably appoints the Buyer, with full power of substitution, as the
Stockholder\'s attorney and proxy to attend any meeting of Stockholders (and
any adjournment or adjournments thereof) called for the purpose of approving
and adopting, among other purposes, the Merger Agreement and the Merger and
to vote such Stockholder\'s Proxy Shares at such meeting and at any
adjournment or adjournments thereof in favor of the approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. This proxy is coupled with the interests provided
for or contemplated under this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and shall
be irrevocable until terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section
6 hereof.   3. No Voting Trusts. The Stockholder agrees that the Stockholder
will not, nor will the Stockholder permit any entity under the Stockholder\'s
control to, deposit any of the Proxy Shares in a voting trust or subject any
of the Proxy Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the
Proxy Shares inconsistent with this Agreement.   4. Revocation of Prior
Proxies; Limitation on Dispositions and Proxies. The Stockholder hereby
revokes any and all previous proxies with respect to the Proxy Shares or any
other voting securities of the Company that relate to the approval of the
Merger Agreement. During the term of this Agreement, the Stockholder agrees
not to (a) sell, assign, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the
Proxy Shares, or (b) grant any proxies with respect to (except for a Proxy or
a proxy which is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement) any of
the Proxy Shares.   5. Specific Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages to the other party
if a party hereto fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this
Agreement, and that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will
not have an adequate remedy at law or in damages. Accordingly, each party
hereto agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition
to remedies at law or damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure
and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that the other
party has an adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto agrees that it will
not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing, or posting
of a bond in connection with any other party\'s seeking or obtaining such
equitable relief.   6. Term of Agreement; Termination. Subject to Section
10(e), the term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and such
term and this Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
Effective Time, (ii) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms or (iii) the date on which the Voting Agreement and
Irrevocable Proxy dated as of the date hereof between the Buyer and Pequot
Private Equity Fund II, L.P. is terminated. Upon such termination, no party
shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, that
such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of
this Agreement prior to such termination.   7. Securities Act Covenants and
Representations. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the other covenants and
representations set forth herein, the Stockholder hereby agrees and
represents to Bursar that such Stockholder understands that, to the extent
such Stockholder is an "affiliate" (as such term    2  is defined in Rule
405 under the Securities Act) of the Company as of the date hereof or the
date the Merger Agreement is submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the
Company, any public offering, sale or other disposition by such Stockholder
or any of its wholly owned affiliates of any shares of Parent Common Stock
received by such person in the Merger (collectively, the "Restricted Sales")
will, under current law, require any of (i) the further registration under
the Securities Act of any such shares to be sold by such person, (ii)
compliance with applicable provisions of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC
under the Securities Act, as amended or (iii) the availability of another
exemption from such registration under the Securities Act. The Stockholder
agrees not to, and not to cause or permit any of its wholly owned Affiliates
to, make any Restricted Sale unless the conditions of clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) are met.   8. Representations and Warranties. The Stockholder
represents and warrants to the Buyer as follows:   (a) The Stockholder is
the lawful owner of the Shares, free and clear of all liens, charges,
options, rights, encumbrances, stockholders agreements, voting agreements,
agreements to transfer or otherwise dispose of such Shares and commitments of
every kind, other than this Agreement and has the sole power to vote (or
cause to be voted) the Shares as set forth in this Agreement. Neither the
Stockholder nor any of its Affiliates owns or holds any rights to acquire any
additional securities of the Company or any interest therein or any voting
rights with respect to any additional shares of Company any other securities
of the Company.   (b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
a duly authorized officer to the Stockholder.   (c) This Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Stockholder, enforceable
against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, oratorium and similar laws relating to or affecting creditors
generally by general equity principles (regardless of whether enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing.   (d) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Stockholder does not violate or breach, and will not give
rise to any violation or breach, of the Stockholder\'s charter or by-laws,
except as will not materially impair the ability of such Stockholder to
effectuate, carry out or comply with all of the terms of this Agreement, any
law, third party consent, Governmental Body approval or Contract by which the
Stockholder, the Proxy Shares or its assets or properties may be bound.  
9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and contains the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented
or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by

parties hereto agree as follows:     1. Agreement to Vote Shares. The

Irrevocable Proxy. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints the Buyer,
with full power of substitution, as the Stockholder\'s attorney and proxy to
attend any meeting of stockholders (and any adjournment or

Proxy Shares inconsistent with this Agreement.   4. Revocation of Prior
Proxies; Limitation on Dispositions and Proxies. The Stockholder hereby
revokes any and all previous proxies with respect to the Proxy Shares or any
other voting securities of the Company that relate to the approval of the
Merger Agreement or the Asset Sale. During the term of this Agreement, the

party hereto acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the
damages to the other party if a party hereto fails to comply with the
obligations imposed by this Agreement, and that, in the event of any such
failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law or in

other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or damages, is
the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting

representations set forth herein, the Stockholder hereby agrees and
represents to the Buyer that the Stockholder understands that, to the extent

any public offering, sale or other disposition by the Stockholder or any of
its wholly owned Affiliates of any shares of Parent Common Stock received by
such person in the Merger (collectively, the "Restricted Sales") will, under

Agreement shall not be effective or binding upon the Stockholder until after
such time as the Merger Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement are

agree that there is not and has not been any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the matters set

not made as a director or officer of the Company or in any capacity other
than a stockholder of the Company. The Stockholder signs solely in its
capacity as a record holder and beneficial owner of Shares and nothing herein
shall limit or affect any actions taken by a representative of the
Stockholder in such representative\'s capacity as an officer or director of
the Company.   (g) The Stockholder hereby waives for the benefit of the
Company and its stockholders any and all rights it may have under the
Stockholders\' Agreement dated as of January 10, 2000 by and among the

solely with respect to the Merger and the Asset Sale and the other

of five (5) consecutive Trading Days from and after the Closing Date, the
Stockholder agrees not to effect any Transfer (or Transfers) of the shares of
Allscripts Holding, Inc. it receives in the Merger involving in excess of
100,000 shares in the aggregate. Notwithstanding the above, the Stockholder
may deliver a written notice to Allscripts Holding, Inc. that Stockholder
desires to effect a sale to a single purchaser of a number of such shares in
excess of 100,000 shares (a "Block"), which notice (a "Notice of Block
Transfer") sets forth (A) the number of shares of Allscripts Holding, Inc.
Common Stock that the Stockholder desires to    5   Transfer, or maximum
and minimum number of, such shares and (B) the price per share at which the
Stockholder would be willing to Transfer such shares (the "Specified Price").
The Notice of Transfer shall constitute an offer by the Stockholder, which
shall be irrevocable for a period of 10 days following receipt of such notice
by Allscripts Holding, Inc., to permit Allscripts Holding, Inc. to arrange
for the purchase of the maximum number (but not fewer than the minimum
number) of such shares by a purchaser selected by Allscripts Holding, Inc. in
its sole discretion for cash at a price per share equal to the average of the
Per Share Market Value (as defined below) of such shares for the five (5)
Trading Days immediately preceding (and excluding) the date that Allscripts
Holding, Inc. delivers a written notice to the Stockholder (the "Notice of
Purchase") that Allscripts Holding, Inc. has arranged for such purchase at
such price per share (the "Current Price"); provided, however, that the
Stockholder shall have no obligation to Transfer any of its shares to
the proposed purchaser if the Current Price does not equal at least 90% of
the Specified Price offered in the Notice of Transfer.  The consummation of
such purchase shall take place on such date, not later than 10 days after
receipt of the Notice of Purchase by the Stockholder , as Allscripts Holding,
Inc. and the Stockholder shall select. Upon the consummation of such
purchase, (A) the Stockholder shall deliver the certificate or certificates
evidencing the shares so purchased duly endorsed in blank for transfer or
accompanied by written instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the
purchaser duly executed by the Stockholder, free and clear of any
liens, encumbrances and claims and (B) the purchaser shall simultaneously
with the delivery of the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares so
purchased pay to the Stockholder the aggregate Current Price of such
shares.  Allscripts Holding, Inc. shall have no obligation to deliver a
Notice of Purchase in response to any Notice of Transfer delivered by the
Stockholder, and the decision as to whether to deliver any Notice of Purchase
shall be made by Allscripts Holding, Inc. in the exercise of its sole
discretion. In the event that Allscripts Holding, Inc. shall have received a
Notice of Transfer from the Stockholder but shall not have given a Notice of
Purchase to the Stockholder with respect thereto prior to the expiration of
the 10-day period following receipt of such Notice of Transfer, nothing in
this Section 12 shall limit the right of the Stockholder to Transfer any
shares that are not to be purchased pursuant to a Notice of Purchase
otherwise subject to the foregoing provision of this Section 12.  For the
purposes of this Section 12, "Per Share Market Value" shall mean, on
any particular date (i) the last sale price per share of the Allscripts
Holding, Inc. Common Stock on such date on the principal stock exchange on
which the Allscripts Holding, Inc. Common Stock has been listed or, if there
is no such price on such date, then the last price on such exchange on the
date nearest preceding such date, or (ii) if the Allscripts Holding, Inc.
Common Stock is not listed on any stock exchange, the final bid price for a
share of Allscripts Holding, Inc. Common Stock in the over-the-counter
market, as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market at the close of business on
such date, or the last sales price if such price is reported and final bid
prices are not available, or (iii) if the Allscripts Holding, Inc. Common
Stock is not quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market, the bid price for a share of
Allscripts Holding, Inc. Common Stock in the over- the-counter market as
reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated (or any similar
organization or agency succeeding to its functions of reporting prices), or
(iv) if the Allscripts Holding, Inc. Common Stock is no    6   longer
publicly traded, as determined by an investment banking firm to be mutually
selected by Allscripts Holding, Inc. and the Stockholder.     [Remainder

AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY (the "Agreement"), dated as of July 13, 2000,

(the "ChannelHealth Merger"); and   WHEREAS, the Stockholder owns of record
and beneficially the number of shares of capital stock of the Company set

WHEREAS, the Stockholder wishes to enter into this Agreement with respect to
(i) all of the Shares, (ii)all of the shares of the Company\'s capital stock
which the Stockholder acquires during the term of this Agreement and

and adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders is a
condition to the consummation of the ChannelHealth Merger; and   WHEREAS,
in order to induce ChannelHealth and IDX to enter into the Merger Agreement,
the Stockholder has agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, to vote the Proxy Shares and to deliver an irrevocable proxy to
ChannelHealth to vote the Proxy Shares at any meeting of the Company\'s
Stockholders or in connection with any action by consent of the Company\'s
Stockholders, in favor of (i) the issuance of the ChannelHealth Merger Shares
and the Allscripts Merger Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (ii)
the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of
the ChannelHealth Merger and the Allscripts Merger.   Capitalized terms
used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms in the Merger Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable
consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   1. Agreement to Vote
Shares. The Stockholder agrees during the term of this Agreement to vote, and
to cause its Affiliates to vote, the Proxy Shares, in person or by proxy (or
by written consent if action is taken by written consent) in favor of (i) the
issuance of the ChannelHealth Merger Shares and the Allscripts Merger Shares
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (ii) approval and adoption of the Merger
Agreement and the approval of the ChannelHealth Merger and the Allscripts
Merger at any meeting of the Stockholders of the Company (or any written
action in lieu of a meeting) at which such matters are considered and at
every adjournment thereof. The Stockholder agrees, not to, and not to permit
any of its Affiliates to, vote or execute any written consent in lieu of a
stockholders meeting or vote of the Company, if such consent or vote by the
stockholders of the Company would be inconsistent with or frustrate the
purposes of the other agreements of the Stockholder pursuant to this
paragraph.   2. Irrevocable Proxy. The Stockholder hereby irrevocably
appoints ChannelHealth, with full power of substitution, as the
Stockholder\'s attorney and proxy to attend any meeting of Stockholders of
the Company or Newco (and any adjournment or adjournments thereof) called for
the purpose of approving the issuance of the ChannelHealth Merger Shares and
the Allscripts Merger Shares and approving and adopting, among other
purposes, the Merger Agreement and the ChannelHealth Merger and the
Allscripts Merger and to vote such Stockholder\'s Proxy Shares at such
meeting and at any adjournment or adjournments thereof in favor of the
approval of the issuance of the ChannelHealth Merger Shares and
the Allscripts Merger Shares and in favor of the Merger Agreement and

respect to the voting of the Proxy Shares inconsistent with this
Agreement.   4. Revocation of Prior Proxies; Limitation on Dispositions
and Proxies. The Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies
with respect to the Proxy Shares or any other voting securities of the
Company that relate to the approval of the Merger Agreement. During the term
of this Agreement, the Stockholder agrees not to grant any proxies with
respect to (except for this Proxy or a proxy which is not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement) any of the Proxy Shares.   5. Specific
Performance. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be impossible to
measure in money the damages to the other party if a party hereto fails to
comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement, and that, in the event
of any such failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law
or in damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that   
2  injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at
law or damages, is the appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not
oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that the other party has an
adequate remedy at law. Each party hereto agrees that it will not seek, and
agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing, or posting of a bond in
connection with any other party\'s seeking or obtaining such equitable
relief.   6. Term of Agreement; Termination. Subject to Section 10(e), the
term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof and such term and
this Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the
Effective Time, or (ii) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with its terms. Upon such termination, no party shall have any
further obligations or liabilities hereunder; provided, that such termination
shall not relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement
prior to such termination.   7. Representations and Warranties of the
Stockholder. Stockholder represents and warrants to ChannelHealth and IDX as

proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of good faith and

Indemnified Party shall give an Indemnifying  Party prompt written notice of
any Third Party Claim  of which such Indemnified Party has knowledge 
concerning any Losses as to which such Indemnified  Party may request
indemnification hereunder. If the  Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
its  obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party  hereunder against any
Losses that may result from  such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party  shall be entitled to assume and control the defense  of such Third
Party Claim at its expense and through  counsel of its choice if it gives
notice of its  intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within  five (5)
days of the receipt of such notice from the  Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that if there  exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict
of  interest that would make it inappropriate in the  judgment of the
Indemnified Party, in its sole and  absolute discretion, for the same counsel
to  represent both the Indemnified Party and the  Indemnifying Party, then
the Indemnified Party shall  be entitled to retain its own counsel, at the
expense    20   of the Indemnifying Party. In the event the 
Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake  any such defense against
any such Third Party Claim  as provided above, the Indemnified Party shall 
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense  and make available to
the Indemnifying Party, at the  Indemnifying Party\'s expense, all
witnesses,  pertinent records, materials and information in the  Indemnified
Party\'s possession or under the  Indemnified Party\'s control relating
thereto as is  reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.  Similarly, in
the event the Indemnified Party is,  directly or indirectly, conducting the
defense  against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying  Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in  such defense and make available to
the Indemnified  Party, at the Indemnified Party\'s expense, all such 
witnesses, records, materials and information in the  Indemnifying Party\'s
possession or under the  Indemnifying Party\'s control relating thereto as
is  reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such  Third Party Claim
may be settled by the Indemnifying  Party without the prior written consent

Party be liable to  an Indemnified Party for any indirect, incidental, 
special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages  arising out of or
otherwise relating to this  Agreement, even if the Indemnifying Party has
been  advised of the possibility or likelihood of such  damages.   12.7.4
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any  claim that would
otherwise be subject to  indemnification by a party pursuant to this 
Agreement, if indemnification with respect to such  claim is governed by the
License Agreement, then no  indemnification shall be available under this 
Agreement.   12.8 Expenses. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement,

be bound by the same restrictions as IDX hereunder.   (e) One or more
Transfers to any Person (other than IDX or any of its Affiliates) who shall
have commenced a tender or exchange offer for shares of Allscripts Common
Stock if, at the time of public announcement of the tender or exchange offer:
(i) IDX and its Affiliates collectively Beneficially Own less than 5% of the
then outstanding Allscripts Voting Shares and no IDX Designee is serving on
the Allscripts Board of Directors, or (ii) IDX and its Affiliates
collectively Beneficially Own more than 5% of the then outstanding Allscripts
Voting Shares and a majority of the Allscripts Continuing Directors recommend
to the holders of the shares of Allscripts Common Stock that such holders
accept such tender or exchange offer.   (f) From and after the following
anniversaries of the date of this Agreement, IDX and its Affiliates may,
collectively, Transfer the following percentages of the IDX Shares in one or
more Private Placements and/or transactions described below in Sections
2.4(g) or 2.4(h):   PERCENTAGE OF  IDX SHARES   ANNIVERSARY OF PERMITTED
TO TRANSFER*  THIS AGREEMENT INCREMENTAL* AGGREGATE*  --------------
----------- ---------   First 25% 25%  Second 25% 50%  Third 25% 75% 
Fourth 25% 100%    10   *These time restrictions and percentages will
also apply to  any shares of Allscripts Common Stock acquired by IDX and 
its Affiliates pursuant to Article III of the Merger  Agreement, which will
result in additional IDX Shares that  can be Transferred based on the
percentage limitations  being applied to a greater number of IDX
Shares.  In any month, no more than 16.6667% of the IDX Shares eligible to
be Transferred during the then current year may be sold by IDX and its
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 2.4(f). IDX and its Affiliates shall not
be permitted to cumulate, or carry forward for Transfer in subsequent
periods, either (i) unsold maximum monthly eligible share Transfer amounts
from month to month during any particular year or (ii) unsold maximum annual
eligible share Transfer amounts from year to year.   (g) Subject to Section
2.4(f), one or more Transfers in accordance with Rule 144; provided, however,
that no Transfers shall be permitted pursuant to Rule 144 except through one
of the market makers in Allscripts\'s Common Stock listed on Schedule II or
as otherwise previously approved in writing by Allscripts.   (h) (i) During
each of the periods (A) from and after the first anniversary of the date
hereof through the second anniversary of the date hereof and (B) from and
after the third anniversary of the date hereof through the fourth anniversary
of the date hereof, IDX may deliver a written notice to Allscripts that IDX
desires to Transfer in a single transaction either 50% or 100% of the maximum
aggregate number of its IDX Shares that it would be permitted to Transfer in
that period, which notice (the "Notice of Proposed Transfer") must set forth
(A) the number of IDX Shares that IDX desires to Transfer (which number must
equal either 50% or 100% of the maximum aggregate number of shares that it
would be permitted to Transfer in that period) and (B) the price at which IDX
would be willing to Transfer such shares (the "Target Price"). The Notice of
Proposed Transfer shall constitute an offer by IDX, which shall be
irrevocable for a period of 10 days following receipt of such notice
by Allscripts, to permit Allscripts to arrange for the purchase of such
shares by a purchaser selected by Allscripts in its sole discretion for cash
at a price per share equal to the average of the Per Share Market Value of
such shares for the five Trading Days immediately preceding (and excluding)
the date that Allscripts delivers a written notice to IDX (the "Notice of
Arranged Transfer") that Allscripts has arranged for such purchase at such
price per share (the "Market Price"); provided, however, that IDX shall have
no obligation to Transfer any of its IDX Shares to the proposed purchaser if
the proposed purchase price per share does not equal at least 90% of the
Target Price.   (ii) The consummation of such purchase shall take place
on such date, not later than 10 days after receipt of the Notice of
Arranged Transfer by IDX, as Allscripts and IDX shall select. Upon the
consummation of such purchase, (A) IDX shall deliver the certificate or
certificates evidencing the IDX Shares so purchased duly endorsed in blank
for transfer or accompanied by written instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the purchaser duly executed by IDX, free and clear of any
liens, encumbrances and claims and (B) the purchaser shall simultaneously
with the delivery of the certificate or certificates evidencing the IDX
Shares so purchased pay to IDX the aggregate Market Price of such
shares.    11   (iii) Allscripts shall have no obligation to deliver
a Notice of Arranged Transfer in response to any Notice of Proposed
Transfer delivered by IDX, and the decision as to whether to deliver any
Notice of Arranged Transfer shall be made by Allscripts in the exercise of
its sole discretion. In the event that Allscripts shall have received a
Notice of Proposed Transfer from IDX but shall not have given a Notice of
Arranged Transfer to IDX with respect thereto prior to the expiration of the
10-day period following receipt of such Notice of Proposed Transfer, nothing
in this Section 2.4(h) shall limit the right of IDX to Transfer any IDX
Shares that are not to be purchased pursuant to a Notice of Arranged
Transfer, but otherwise subject to and in accordance with the time,
percentage and other restrictions set forth in Section 2.4(f).   (i) (i)
From and after the fifth anniversary of the date hereof, IDX agrees not to
effect any Transfer of IDX Shares in any single transaction involving a
number of such shares representing in excess of 2.5% of the then issued and
outstanding shares of Allscripts Common Stock unless and until IDX delivers a
written notice to Allscripts that IDX intends to effect such Transfer, which
notice (a "Notice of Block Transfer") must set forth (A) the number of IDX
Shares that IDX desires to Transfer, or maximum and minimum number of, such
shares and (B) the price per share at which IDX would be willing to Transfer
such shares (the "Specified Price"). The Notice of Block Transfer shall
constitute an offer by IDX, which shall be irrevocable for a period of
10 days following receipt of such notice by Allscripts, to permit Allscripts
to arrange for the purchase of the maximum number (but not fewer than the
minimum number) of such shares by a purchaser selected by Allscripts in its
sole discretion for cash at a price per share equal to the average of the Per
Share Market Value of such shares for the five Trading Days immediately
preceding (and excluding) the date that Allscripts delivers a written notice
to IDX (the "Notice of Block Purchase") that Allscripts has arranged for such
purchase at such price per share (the "Current Price"); provided, however,
that IDX shall have no obligation to Transfer any of its IDX Shares to the
proposed purchaser if the Current Price does not equal at least 90% of the
Specified Price offered in the Notice of Block Transfer.   (ii) The
consummation of such purchase shall take place on such date, not later than
10 days after receipt of the Notice of Block Purchase by IDX , as Allscripts
and IDX shall select. Upon the consummation of such purchase, (A) IDX shall
deliver the certificate or certificates evidencing the IDX Shares so
purchased duly endorsed in blank for transfer or accompanied by written
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the purchaser duly executed
by IDX, free and clear of any liens, encumbrances and claims and (B) the
purchaser shall simultaneously with the delivery of the certificate
or certificates evidencing the IDX Shares so purchased pay to IDX the
aggregate Current Price of such shares.   (iii) Allscripts shall have no
obligation to deliver a Notice of Block Purchase in response to any Notice of
Block Transfer delivered by IDX, and the decision as to whether to deliver
any Notice of Block Purchase shall be made by Allscripts in the exercise of
its sole discretion. In the event that Allscripts shall have received a
Notice of Block Transfer from IDX but shall not have given a Notice of Block
Purchase to IDX with respect thereto prior to the expiration of the 10-day
period following receipt of such Notice of Block Transfer, nothing in this
Section 2.4(i) shall limit the right of IDX to Transfer any IDX Shares that
are not to be purchased pursuant to a Notice of Block Purchase.   12  
(j) (i) During the period from and after the third anniversary of the date
hereof through the fourth anniversary of the date hereof, if Allscripts
proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with
respect to primary firm commitment underwritten public offering of Allscripts
Common Stock (a "Piggyback Registration"), it shall give written notice of
such proposed filing to IDX as soon as practicable, but in no event fewer
than 20 days before the anticipated filing date. Allscripts shall include in
such registration all IDX Shares with respect to which Allscripts
has received a written request for inclusion within 10 days after the giving
of Allscripts\'s notice (a "Piggyback Registration Request"); provided,
however, that Allscripts may in its sole discretion restrict the number of
IDX Shares so requested for inclusion to the maximum aggregate number of such
shares that IDX would be permitted to sell in such period after the date that
Allscripts gives notice of its intention to effect a Piggyback
Registration.   (ii) If the managing underwriters of the
Piggyback Registration advise IDX that, in their opinion, the number of
shares requested to be included in such registration exceeds the maximum
number that can be included in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering (the "Maximum Number"), IDX will limit the
number of shares included in such registration to the Maximum Number, and the
shares registered shall be selected in the following order of priority: (A)
first, the shares of Allscripts Common Stock Allscripts proposes to Transfer,
and (B) second, the IDX Shares covered by the Piggyback Registration Request
and other shares requested to be included in such registration based upon
rights under agreements outstanding on the date hereof; provided, however,
that if shares of Common Stock are being offered for the account of Persons
other than IDX, the proportion by which the amount of IDX Shares intended to
be offered for the account of IDX is reduced shall not exceed the proportion
by which the amount of shares of Allscripts Common Stock intended to be
offered for the account of such other Persons is reduced.   (iii) IDX may
not participate in any Piggyback Registration unless it (A) agrees to sell
its shares of Allscripts Common Stock on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by Allscripts, (B) completes and executes
all questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody arrangements, indemnities,
underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably required under the
terms of such underwriting arrangements and this Agreement, and (C) furnishes
in writing to Allscripts such information regarding IDX and other information
as Allscripts may from time to time request or as may be legally required in
connection with such registration; provided, however, that IDX shall not be
required to make any representations or warranties in connection with
any such registration other than representations and warranties as to (x)
its ownership of its IDX Shares to be Transferred free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances and claims, (y) IDX\'s power and authority to effect such
Transfer, and (z) such matters pertaining to compliance with securities laws
as may be reasonably requested; provided further, however, that the
obligation of IDX to indemnify pursuant to any such underwriting agreements
shall be several, not joint and several, among such Persons selling
securities, and the liability of IDX will be in proportion to, and provided
further that such liability will be limited to, the net amount received by
IDX from the sale of the IDX Shares pursuant to such registration.   (iv)
In connection with any Piggyback Registration, Allscripts will enter into
such agreements (including an underwriting agreement) as are customary in
transactions of the kind contemplated by the intended method or methods of
distribution set forth in the Piggyback Registration Statement and   
13  reasonably acceptable to Allscripts, and take such other actions as
are reasonably necessary in connection therewith in order to expedite or
facilitate the Piggyback Registration; and (A) make such representations and
warranties with respect to the Piggyback Registration Statement or any post-
effective amendment or supplement thereto, prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and documents incorporated by reference, if any, to IDX
and the underwriters of the Piggyback Registration in form, substance, and
scope as are customary in connection with transactions of such kind; (B) if
requested by the managing underwriters of the Piggyback Registration, obtain
an opinion of outside counsel to Allscripts in customary form and covering
matters of the type customarily covered by such an opinion, addressed to such
underwriters named in the underwriting agreement and dated the date of the
closing of the sale of the shares covered by the Piggyback Registration
Statement; (C) if requested by the managing underwriters of the Piggyback
Registration, obtain a "comfort" letter (or, if a "comfort" letter may not be
delivered under applicable accounting pronouncements or standards, a single
"procedures" letter) and a single update thereof from each of the independent
certified public accountants who have certified the most recent audited
financial statements that are incorporated by reference in the Piggyback
Registration Statement, which letters shall be addressed to the underwriters
of the Piggyback Registration, such letter or letters to be in customary form
and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "comfort"
letters of such type; (D) deliver such documents and certificates as may be
reasonably requested by IDX and the underwriters of the Piggyback
Registration to evidence compliance with any conditions contained in the
underwriting agreement or other agreements entered into by Allscripts; and
(E) undertake such obligations relating to expense reimbursement as provided
in Section 2.4(j)(v) and indemnification and contribution obligations for the
benefit of IDX of the type customarily undertaken by issuers in connection
with "piggyback" registrations.   (v) In connection with any Piggyback
Registration, Allscripts agrees to bear and to pay, or cause to be paid,
promptly upon request being made therefor, all expenses incident to
Allscripts\'s performance of, or compliance with, this Section 2.4(j),
including, without limitation: (A) all SEC and any National Association of
Securities Dealers registration and filing fees and expenses, (B) all fees
and expenses in connection with the qualification of the shares covered by
any Piggyback Registration Statement for offering and sale under state
securities or "blue sky" laws, including reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel for any underwriter in connection with such qualifications, (C) all
expenses relating to the preparation, printing, distribution and reproduction
of any Piggyback Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or
prepared for distribution pursuant thereto, each amendment or supplement to
the foregoing, the certificates representing the shares covered by such
Piggyback Registration Statement and all other documents relating hereto, (D)
internal expenses of Allscripts, including, without limitation, all salaries
and expenses of Allscripts\'s officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties, (E) fees, disbursements and expenses of Allscripts\'s
counsel and its other advisors and experts and independent certified public
accountants of Allscripts (including the expenses of any opinions or
"comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance and compliance)
and (F) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the
shares covered by the Piggyback Registration Statement on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. or any other stock exchange or dealer quotation system on which
the Allscripts Common Stock shall at such time be listed or
traded (collectively, the "Expenses"). To the extent that any Expenses are
incurred, assumed or paid by IDX or any underwriter of shares covered by the
Piggyback    14  Registration Statement, Allscripts shall reimburse IDX
for the full amount of the Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid promptly
after receipt of a written request therefor, which shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of the Expenses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, IDX shall pay, or cause to be paid, as appropriate, (A) all
underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of the shares
covered by the Piggyback Registration Statement by or on behalf of IDX, (B)
the fees, disbursements and expenses of its counsel in connection with the
offering and sale of such shares and (C) all transfer taxes applicable to the
sale of such shares.   2.5 VOTING OF IDX SHARES. Except as provided below,
during the term of this Agreement, IDX and its Affiliates shall be entitled
to vote on all matters all of its or their IDX Shares in its or their
complete discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IDX and its Affiliates
shall vote all such shares in accordance with the recommendation of the
majority of the Allscripts Continuing Directors on any matter that (i)
constitutes a Allscripts Business Combination Transaction, (ii) would involve
a change of control of Allscripts (for purposes of this section a change in
control shall mean the acquisition by a Person other than IDX or its
Affiliates of Beneficial Ownership of more than 50% of the then outstanding
Allscripts Voting Shares), (iii) involves the issuance by Allscripts of
securities for its own account for cash, or (iv) involves any acquisition by
Allscripts, whether through merger, share exchange, purchase of assets or
otherwise unless (A) the average of the Per Share Market Value for
Allscripts\'s Common Stock for the 90 Trading Days immediately preceding (and
excluding) the date on which the matter is voted upon is less than $_____ per
share (such amount to be appropriately adjusted to give effect to stock
splits, reverse splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and
share exchanges since the date hereof) and (B) there shall exist no
continuing and uncured default by IDX of any of its obligations under this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement, [the Strategic Alliance Agreement or the
Cross License Agreement (as such terms are defined in the Merger Agreement)],
which default shall have resulted in a material adverse effect on the
business, properties, results of operations, prospects, condition (financial
or otherwise) or Per Share Market Value of Allscripts\'s Common Stock in
which case, if both conditions described in subclauses (A) and (B) are
satisfied, IDX and its Affiliates shall be entitled to vote on each matter
described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv) all of its or their IDX
Shares in its or their complete discretion.   2.6 RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN
CERTAIN ISSUANCES BY ALLSCRIPTS.   (a) If, when, and for so long as, IDX
and its Affiliates Beneficially Own shares of Allscripts Common Stock that
would constitute, after giving effect to the proposed transaction (but not
prior to the proposed transaction), less than the Applicable Percentage of
the then outstanding shares of Allscripts Common Stock, Allscripts shall not
issue any shares of Allscripts Common Stock or any Allscripts Exchangeable
Securities, for any consideration or in any type of transaction, unless
Allscripts shall have first complied with, in the case of an issuance other
than pursuant to Public Offering, the provisions of Section 2.6(b) or, in the
case of a Public Offering, the provisions of Section 2.6(c).   (b) If
Allscripts determines to issue any shares of Allscripts Common Stock or any
Allscripts Exchangeable Security, other than in a Public Offering, then
Allscripts shall provide written notice of such determination to IDX, which
notice shall include all the terms of such issuance    15  and shall
offer to IDX the right to purchase, at the same price and on the same terms
as Allscripts proposes to issue such shares of Allscripts Common Stock
or Allscripts Exchangeable Security to others (or, if Allscripts proposes to
issue such shares of Allscripts Common Stock or any Allscripts Exchangeable
Security other than for cash, at a cash price equal to the current market
price of the Allscripts Common Stock or if a Allscripts Exchangeable
Security, such value to be determined by agreement between Allscripts or IDX,
or if the parties are unable to agree, by an investment banking firm or other
asset valuation firm of national reputation selected by IDX from Schedule I
attached hereto (as such Schedule I may be amended in writing from time to
time by both Allscripts and IDX) with the consent of a majority of the
Allscripts Continuing Directors, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, the cost of which shall be borne by Allscripts) a number or amount
of the shares of Allscripts Common Stock or Allscripts Exchangeable
Securities proposed to be issued determined by dividing the aggregate number
of outstanding shares of Allscripts Common Stock then Beneficially Owned by
IDX by the total number of shares of Allscripts Common Stock then outstanding
(the "Offer Notice"). If IDX determines to accept the offer contained in the
Offer Notice, IDX shall deliver a written notice to Allscripts indicating its
acceptance within 10 days after its receipt of the Offer Notice, which notice
shall indicate whether IDX has accepted such offer in whole or in part, and,
if accepted in part, the number or amount of shares of Allscripts Common
Stock or Allscripts Exchangeable Securities as to which such offer has been
accepted (an "Acceptance Notice"). Any acceptance of the offer contained in
an Offer Notice by delivery of an Acceptance Notice shall be irrevocable and
shall constitute a commitment by IDX to purchase from Allscripts, and by
Allscripts to sell to IDX, the number or amount of shares of Allscripts
Common Stock or Allscripts Exchangeable Securities covered by such Acceptance
Notice upon the terms contained in the Offer Notice.   1. If at any time and
from time to time, (i) Allscripts determines to  issue any Allscripts Voting
Shares or any Allscripts Exchangeable  Security in a Public Offering, and
(ii) as a result thereof IDX and its  Affiliates would Beneficially Own less
than the Applicable Percentage  of the then to be outstanding Allscripts
Voting Shares, then (A)  Allscripts shall provide written notice of such
determination to IDX,  which notice shall include the proposed size and other
terms of such  issuance, to the extent then known, the name or names of any
managing  underwriter or placement agent(s) and the date when it is proposed
that  any such issuance will be made, and (B) Allscripts shall either sell 
directly or cause the underwriters or placement agent(s) to offer to  IDX the
right to purchase from Allscripts directly or from the  underwriters or
placement agent(s), at the applicable offering price, a  number or amount of
the Allscripts Voting Shares, Allscripts  Exchangeable Securities or other
securities proposed to be issued that,  if purchased by IDX, would permit IDX
and its Affiliates to  Beneficially Own a number of Voting Shares determined
by dividing the  aggregate number of outstanding shares of Allscripts Common
Stock then  Beneficially Owned by IDX by the total number of shares of
Allscripts  Common Stock then outstanding.    16   3. RESTRICTIONS ON
TRANSFER. From and after the date of Closing and until the expiration of the
six month period following the Closing, R.E.T. shall not Transfer any shares
of Common Stock Beneficially Owned by R.E.T. in his individual capacity,
unless and until such time as Glen E. Tullman ("G.E.T.") shall Transfer any
shares of Common Stock Beneficially Owned by G.E.T. in his individual
capacity.   4. STOCK CERTIFICATES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS.   4.1
ENDORSEMENT OF CERTIFICATES.   (a) All certificates representing IDX Shares
shall, subject to Section 4.1(c), bear the following legend:   "THIS

AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALLSCRIPTS  HOLDING, INC. AND IDX SYSTEMS CORPORATION DATED
AS OF  __________, 2000. A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT  THE
PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OFFICE OF ALLSCRIPTS."   (b) After such time as the
legend set forth in Section 4.1(a) is no longer required hereunder (including
without limitation as a result of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms) or if the securities represented by a certificate
have been registered under the Securities Act pursuant to an effective
registration statement or are to be sold pursuant to Rule 144, or if
Allscripts shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel, which
opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to counsel for Allscripts, that
registration under the Securities Act is not required, as the case may be,
then, in any such event, upon the request of IDX, Allscripts shall cause such
certificate or certificates to be exchanged for a certificate or certificates
that do not bear any legend.   4.2 IMPROPER TRANSFER. Any attempt by IDX or
its Affiliates to Transfer any IDX Shares other than in accordance with this
Agreement shall be null and void and neither Allscripts nor any transfer
agent for such securities shall be required to give any effect to such
attempted Transfer in its stock records.   5. GENERAL PROVISIONS.   5.1

and agreements herein set forth, and in reliance on the representations
and warranties contained herein, the parties hereby agree as follows:  
Section 1.LEASE OF PREMISES. Tenant hereby leases from Landlord,
the following described property (hereinafter referred to as the "Premises"
or "Leased Premises"):   Being a portion of the ground floor of the
Building located at 25  Green Mountain Drive, containing 2,000 square feet of
floor space,  more or less (the "Ground Floor Space"), and a portion of the
first  floor of the Building, containing 13,000 square feet of floor space,

permits of any  municipal, county, state or federal department having
jurisdiction  over the Leased Premises.    3   Landlord shall fit-up the
Premises as necessary to secure and  separate the Premises from all other
tenants\' space at the Building.  Landlord shall pay the costs incurred by
Landlord in connection with  such fit-up work.    Section 2.TERM OF LEASE.
The Premises are hereby leased to Tenant subject to all of the terms and
conditions herein contained, for a term (the "Term") which shall commence on
[Closing], 2000 (the "Commencement Date") and shall expire five (5) years
from the date of [Closing]. For purposes hereof, the first Lease year under
this Lease (a "Lease Year") shall be deemed to expire one (1) year from the
[Closing] date, and each Lease Year thereafter shall expire on the
anniversary of such date. Tenant shall have a one-time right to extend
the Term of this Lease for an additional five (5) year period by notifying
Landlord in writing no later than the end of the fourth Lease Year. Minimum
Rent (as defined in Section 4 below) during such extension Term will be the
greater of (i) ninety-five percent (95%) of the then fair market rental rate,
or (ii) 103% of the Minimum Rent in effect under this Lease during the
immediately preceding Lease Year. Landlord will notify Tenant of the
effective rental rate no later than three (3) months prior to the
commencement of the extension Term.   Section 3.USE OF PREMISES. Tenant
shall use the Premises for commercial office, sales and administrative
purposes, together with other incidental uses, and for no other purpose
without the Landlord\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Tenant shall not use the Premises for the storage,
manufacture, inspection, or packaging of acids, flammables, or hazardous
materials of any kind (other than the use of cleaning materials in normal
quantities that are consistent with the uses of the Premises for
office/sales/administrative and similar uses, provided all such actions
are in accordance with all federal, state and local statutes, rules,
regulations and laws.) Tenant shall have access to the Premises seven (7)
days per week, twenty-four (24) hours per day.   Tenant will operate the
Premises in a manner consistent with the character and quality of the
Building. Tenant shall keep the Premises in a neat, clean and safe condition.

to Landlord, without demand or set off, in lawful money of the United States,
at the address specified in Section 25, or at such other location as Landlord
may hereafter designate in writing, Minimum Rent for the Leased Premises
which shall be the product computed by multiplying the area of the Premises
in square feet (e.g., during the first Lease Year, 15,000 square feet) by the
amount of $13.00 triple net per square foot per annum.)   For the
convenience of the Landlord, the Minimum Rent shall be paid in monthly
installments of Sixteen Thousand Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($16,250). Each
installment of Minimum Rent shall be due and payable in advance, on the first
day of each month. The first payment of Minimum Rent shall be due and payable
on or before the Commencement Date. Minimum Rent shall be pro rated for any
partial month of the Term.    4   Notwithstanding the above, at the end
of the first Lease Year (i.e.,365 days from [Closing]), and at the end of
every Lease Year thereafter, the Minimum Rent rate shall be adjusted
according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, using the "Consumer
Price Index - All Items" (1982-1984 = 100) figure as of the Commencement Date
for a base, and adjusting the annual Minimum Rent rate to be paid hereunder
in direct proportion to the change in the said CPI; provided, however, that
annual Minimum Rent rate (multiplied by the square footage demised by this
Lease) shall not increase more than three percent (3%) in any given Lease
Year. In the event that the adjusted rent, according to the CPI, shall be
less than the Minimum Rent stated above for the prior Lease Year, then the
rent shall be the amount of the Minimum Rent for such prior Lease Year.  
The Minimum Rent and all other sums payable under the Lease shall be paid
without notice, demand, counterclaim, set off, deduction, or defense
and without abatement, suspension, diminution, or reduction, and the
obligations and liabilities of Tenant under the Lease shall in no way be
released, discharged or otherwise affected (except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Lease herein) by reason of any occurrence whatsoever.

rata share shall be 32%. Pursuant to the terms of Section 36, during the
second Lease Year, Tenant\'s pro rata share shall be 39% and during the third
Lease Year, Tenant\'s pro rata share shall be 47%. In the event Tenant leases
any additional space in the Building during the Term or any extension Term
pursuant to Section 36 or otherwise, its pro rata share shall be
adjusted accordingly.   Section 7. CASUALTY INSURANCE. Landlord will insure
the Building against loss by fire, in such amounts as Landlord may consider

Tenant written notice by registered mail of the filing  of any notice thereof
against the Premises or the owner,  for or purporting to be for labor or
materials alleged to  be furnished or to be charged by or for Tenant at the 
Leased Premises, or will bond such mechanics\' liens and use  its best
efforts to have such liens discharged by an order  of a court of competent
jurisdiction within said thirty  (30) day period.   f. Any alterations,
improvements or other work once begun must  be prosecuted with reasonable
diligence to completion and,  subject to the provisions of Subsection 9(e),
above, be  paid for by Tenant in full, free and clear of liens or 
encumbrances against the Leased Premises or Landlord, and  must be performed
in all respects in accordance with law.   Section 10. REPAIRS, REPLACEMENTS.
Tenant has inspected and is familiar with the condition of the Leased
Premises, and Tenant shall take and accept the same "as is," with no
representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the quality of the
Premises or the suitability of the Premises for Tenant\'s intended use.
Landlord represents and warrants that it has no knowledge of any current
violation of any law, rule, code, or ordinance with respect to the Leased
Premises. Tenant shall make all non-structural, maintenance, repairs and
replacements to the interior portions of the Leased Premises as may
be reasonably required to place, keep and maintain the same in good order and
state of repair, including repairs to any glass which may become broken, and
any repairs to other portions of Landlord\'s building which are necessitated
by the actions or negligence of Tenant, its employees and agents.  
Landlord shall be responsible for all structural repairs to the Premises and
all maintenance and repairs to the Building, the systems within and serving
the Building, and the landscaping and other amenities located on the Lot,
including, without limitation, the removal of snow from the walkways and   
7  parking lot located on the Lot. In the event Landlord fails to comply
with its obligations hereunder for a period of thirty (30) days after written
notice of such failure from Tenant, or such longer period as may be
reasonably necessary to remedy such failure provided that Landlord has
commenced such remedy within such thirty (30) day period and is diligently
prosecuting the same to completion, then Tenant may undertake to perform such
repairs or maintenance, and Landlord shall promptly reimburse Tenant for its
out of pocket expenses in connection therewith. If Landlord fails to
reimburse Tenant as aforesaid, then Tenant may offset the Minimum Rent due
hereunder in the amount of such expenses provided Tenant provides Landlord
with a written summary of such offset and copies of invoices supporting its
offset amounts.   Section 11. TENANT TO COMPLY WITH LAWS, ETC. Tenant shall
and will at its own cost and expense promptly execute and comply with any and
all requirements at any time affecting the Leased Premises imposed by any
present or future, foreseen or unforeseen, law, statute, or governmental
authority now existing or hereafter created, whether the same or any of them
relate to changes or requirements incidental to or the result of any use or
occupation thereof or otherwise. Tenant shall further so comply with each and
every rule, order and requirement of any federal, state, municipal,
legislative, executive, judicial or other governmental body, commissioner or
officer or of any bureau or department thereof, whether now existing or
hereafter created, having jurisdiction over the Leased Premises or any part
thereof, or exercising any power relative thereto or to the owners, tenants
or occupants thereof. Landlord shall cure, or shall reimburse Tenant for the
cost of curing, any violation of any such rule, order or requirement provided
(i) such violation did not arise as a result of Tenant\'s use in a manner not
permitted under this lease of the Premises, and (ii) Tenant\'s alteration,
repair or other work at the Leased Premises did not jeopardize or eliminate
any so-called grandfather status under which such violation would have been
otherwise exempt from such cure requirement.   Section 12. NO WAIVER. The
failure of Landlord to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict
performance of any of the terms, covenants, conditions and agreements of this
Lease Agreement, or to exercise any option herein conferred, shall not be
considered as waiving or relinquishing for the future any such terms,
covenants or conditions, agreements or options, but the same shall continue
and shall remain in full force and effect; and the receipt of any rent or any
part thereof, whether the rent be that specifically reserved or that which
may become payable under any of the covenants herein contained, and whether
the same be received from Tenant or from any one claiming under or through
Tenant or otherwise shall not be deemed to operate as a waiver of the rights
of Landlord to enforce the payment of rent or charges of any kind previously
due or which may thereafter become due, or the right to terminate this Lease
Agreement and to recover possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or
otherwise, as Landlord may deem proper, or to exercise any of the rights or
remedies reserved to Landlord hereunder or which Landlord may have at law, in
equity or otherwise.   Section 13. LANDLORD\'S RIGHT OF ACCESS. Landlord or
Landlord\'s agents shall have the right to enter the Premises in a reasonable
manner upon twenty-four (24) hours advance notice to Tenant to examine the
same, and to show them to prospective purchasers, mortgagees, or lessees.
Nothing herein contained, however, shall be deemed or construed to impose
upon Landlord any    8  obligations, responsibility or liability
whatsoever, for the care, supervision or repair, of the Leased Premises or
any part thereof, other than as herein expressly provided.   Section 14.
PRIORITY OF MORTGAGES. This Lease Agreement shall automatically and without
further act or deed be and remain subject and subordinate to any existing
mortgage and any mortgage or mortgages that may hereafter be placed against
the Leased Premises, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations,
replacements and extensions thereof. Tenant will execute any estoppel
certificates and Subordination and Non-Disturbance Agreements which Landlord
may request, provided that the same are in reasonable form.   Section 15.
ASSIGNMENT, SUBLETTING. Without the prior written consent of Landlord (which
consent Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold or delay, due consideration
being given to the experience of the proposed assignee or subtenant in the
conduct of businesses permitted by this Lease Agreement and also to the
financial stature of such proposed assignee or subtenant), neither Tenant,
nor Tenant\'s legal representatives or successors in interest shall assign
this Lease Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, or sublet the whole
or any part of the Leased Premises. If Tenant sublets the Premises,
then Landlord shall be entitled to receive fifty percent (50%) of all amounts
paid pursuant to such sublease in excess of the full amount otherwise due
from Tenant under this Lease net of the costs of such subletting (e.g.,
brokers\' fees, attorneys\' fees and expenses and fit-up costs).   Section
16. DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. If the Premises are damaged by fire or by any
other cause, the following provisions shall apply:   a. If the damage is to
such extent that the cost of  restoration, as reasonably estimated by
Landlord, will  equal or exceed $50,000.00, Landlord may, no later than 
sixty (60) days following the damage, give Tenant a notice  stating that
Landlord elects to terminate this Lease  Agreement. If such notice shall be
given: (i) this Lease  Agreement shall terminate on the third day after the
giving  of said notice; (ii) Tenant shall surrender possession of  the
Premises within a reasonable time thereafter; and (iii)  all rent shall be
apportioned to the date of such  surrender, and any rent paid for any period
beyond the date  of such surrender shall be repaid to Tenant.   b. If the
cost of restoration, as reasonably estimated by  Landlord, shall amount to
less than $50,000.00, or if  despite the cost Landlord does not give notice
to Tenant of  its election to terminate in accordance with Subsection 
16(a), above, Landlord shall restore the Premises with  reasonable
promptness, subject to delays beyond Landlord\'s  control and delays in
making of insurance adjustments by  Landlord, and Tenant shall not have the
right to terminate  this Lease Agreement on account of such damage (unless
such  restoration cannot be completed within sixty (60) days, in  which
event Tenant will have the right to terminate this  Lease Agreement
forthwith, by written notice to Landlord).   In the case of either clause
(a) or clause (b) above, if which the use of the Premises is affected by any
such damage, there shall be either an    9  abatement or a reduction in
rent during the period for which the Premises are not reasonably usable for
the purposes for which they are leased hereunder, the amount of such
abatement or reduction to fairly and appropriately reflect the degree to
which Tenant is thereby prevented from using the Premises for such purposes.
The words "restoration" and "restore" as used in this Section shall include
repairs.   Section 17. EMINENT DOMAIN. If, at any time during the term of
this Lease Agreement, title to a substantial portion of the Premises (meaning
thereby so much as shall render the remaining portion substantially unusable
by the Tenant for the purposes set forth in Section 3 shall be taken by
exercise of the right to condemnation or eminent domain or by agreement
between Landlord and those authorized to exercise such right (all such
proceedings being collectively referred to as a "Taking"), this Lease shall
terminate and expire on the date of such Taking and rent shall be apportioned
and paid to the date of such Taking. Except as expressly set forth below, any
award for the value of the Premises, land, buildings and improvements, and
loss of rent from Tenant, shall belong to Landlord, and Tenant shall not be
entitled to share in any such award. To the extent such compensation award or
recovery to Tenant does not diminish the amount of the compensation award or
recovery otherwise awardable to Landlord, Tenant shall have the right to
claim and recover from the condemning authority, but not from the Landlord,
such compensation as may be separately awarded or recoverable by the Tenant
in Tenant\'s own right on account of any and all damage to Tenant\'s business
by reason of any condemnation, for and on account of any cost or loss to
which Tenant might be put in relocating its equipment or removing Tenant\'s
furniture, fixtures and equipment from the Premises, for any cost or loss to
Tenant\'s improvements, or for loss of the value, if any, of Tenant\'s
leasehold interest at the time of the Taking.   If the title to less than a
"substantial portion" of the Premises shall be taken in condemnation so that
the business conducted on said Premises can be continued without material
diminution, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If the Taking
does not amount to a substantial portion but does materially adversely affect
the Tenant\'s ability to conduct its business, the rent from and after the
date of the vesting of title in the condemnor shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect the diminished value of the Premises to the Tenant as a direct result
of the condemnation.   Section 18. INDEMNITY.  ---------   a. Tenant
shall indemnify and save harmless Landlord from and  against any and all
liability, claims, demands, damages,  expenses, fees, fines, penalties,
suits, proceedings,  actions and causes of action of every kind and nature, 
including Landlord\'s costs and reasonable attorneys\' fees,  suffered or
incurred as a result of any breach by Tenant,  its agents, servants,
employees, visitors or licensees of  any covenant or condition of this Lease,
or as a result of  Tenant\'s use or occupancy of the Leased Premises, or
the  carelessness, negligence or improper conduct of Tenant,  its agents,
servants, employees, visitors or licensees;  provided, however, that it is
understood and agreed that  the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall not
extend to  the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord, its  employees,
agents or representatives.    10   b. Landlord shall indemnify and save
harmless Tenant from and  against any and all liability, claims, demands,
damages,  expenses, fees, fines, penalties, suits, proceedings,  actions and
causes of action of every kind and nature,  including Tenant\'s costs and
reasonable attorneys\' fees,  suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of
any breach  by Landlord, its agents, servants, employees, visitors or 
licensees of any covenant or condition of this Lease, or  the carelessness,
negligence or improper conduct of  Landlord, its agents, servants, employees,
visitors or  licensees; provided, however, that it is understood and  agreed
that the obligations of Landlord hereunder shall  not extend to the
negligence or willful misconduct of  Tenant its employees, agents or
representatives.    Section 19. EVENTS OF DEFAULT, REMEDIES, DAMAGES. 
------------------------------------   a. Each of the following shall
constitute an Event of Default:   (i) Tenant shall fail to pay when and as
due any  Minimum Rent payable under this Lease  Agreement, and, provided no
such default has  occurred more than two times within the  previous twelve
(12) months, such default shall  continue for a period of ten (10) days
after  written notice of such default from Landlord to  Tenant; or   (ii)
Tenant shall fail to perform or comply with any  of the agreements, terms,
covenants or  conditions in this Lease Agreement, other than  those referred
to in Subsection 19(a)(i), for a  period of thirty (30) days after notice
from  Landlord to Tenant specifying the items in  default, or in the case of
a default or  contingency which cannot with due diligence be  cured within
said thirty (30) day period,  Tenant shall fail to commence within said 
thirty (30) day period the steps necessary to  cure the same and thereafter
to prosecute the  curing of such default with due diligence (it  being
understood that the time of Tenant within  which to cure shall be extended
for such period  as may be reasonably necessary to complete the  same with
all due diligence); or   (iii) Tenant shall file a voluntary petition in 
bankruptcy or shall have a petition in  bankruptcy filed against it which is
not  removed within thirty (30) days after filing,  or shall be adjudicated
insolvent, or a  receiver or trustee shall be appointed of all  or
substantially all of the property of Tenant  or Tenant shall make any
assignment for the  benefit of Tenant\'s creditors, or Tenant shall  vacate
the Premises.   b. For so long as an Event of Default shall exist and be 
continuing, Landlord may give written notice to Tenant  specifying the Event
of Default and stating that Tenant\'s  rights to the possession, use and
occupancy of the Premises  under this Lease Agreement shall expire and
terminate on  the date specified in such notice, which date shall be at 
least ten (10) days after the giving of notice, and upon    11   the date
so specified, all rights of Tenant under this  Lease Agreement shall so
expire and terminate.   c. Upon termination of Tenant\'s rights to
possession, use and  occupancy of the Premises under this Lease Agreement
in  accordance with the provisions of Subsection 19(b), above,  Tenant shall
pay Landlord an amount equal to any Minimum  Rent and any damages which shall
have been due or sustained  prior to such termination, together with all
reasonable  costs, fees and expenses (including, but not limited to, 
reasonable attorneys\' fees) incurred by Landlord in pursuit  of its remedies
hereunder.   d. Upon any termination of this Lease Agreement pursuant to 
this Section 19, Tenant shall immediately vacate the  Premises and surrender
the same to Landlord restored to  the same condition as received, reasonable
wear and tear  excepted. In the event Tenant fails to so vacate and 
surrender the Premises, Tenant shall pay all costs  reasonably incurred by
Landlord in requiring Tenant to  vacate, including reasonable attorneys\'
fees and  disbursements and, further, will pay Landlord a daily  occupancy
charge equal to two hundred percent (200%) of  the average daily rental
payable by Tenant during the most  recent Lease Agreement year until Tenant
vacates the  Premises as provided in the terms of this Lease Agreement. 
Tenant expressly agrees that, for so long as any Event of  Default shall
exist and be continuing, Landlord shall have  the right to immediately regain
possession of the Premises  and to exclude Tenant from further use, occupancy
and  enjoyment thereof, and Tenant waives any and all claims  which it may
have against Landlord, regardless of when the  same arise, on account of such
regaining of possession by  Landlord or such exclusion. Upon the termination
of this  Lease Agreement, Tenant will remove all goods and effects  not the
property of Landlord, at Tenant\'s expense. Any  damage thereby caused to the
Premises shall be promptly  repaired by Tenant, at Tenant\'s expense. At
Landlord\'s  option, any goods and effects not so removed shall be  deemed
abandoned by Tenant and thereupon shall become the  sole property of
Landlord. In the event Tenant shall fail  or refuse to vacate the Premises
without breach of the  peace after termination, Landlord may obtain a court
order  for the payment of rent into court in accordance with the  terms of
12 V.S.A.ss. 4853a. Landlord shall also have all  other rights and remedies
as may be available under  applicable law at the time of the occurrence of
the Event  of Default.   Section 20. SIGNS. Tenant shall not install or
display any sign, logo or advertising medium on or outside of the Premises
unless Landlord shall have given its prior written consent to the sign,
display or advertising medium, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and Tenant shall have obtained from such others
including government authorities and agencies with or claiming jurisdiction
over the Premises all necessary permits and approvals for the proposed sign,
display or advertising medium. Tenant shall be allowed to install a sign on
the exterior of the building, in the parking lot and in the inside of the
Building subject to Landlord\'s approval which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.    12   Section 21. BROKER COMMISSIONS.
Landlord and Tenant each warrant and represent to each other that they have
no knowledge of any real estate broker or agent to whom a commission may be
payable as a result of this transaction or any such knowledge of any
finder\'s fees or commissions related thereto. Each party agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the other for all claims or demands of any real estate
agent or broker claiming by, through, or under such party.
This indemnification shall also include payment of costs and attorneys\' fees
incurred by a party in defense of a claim for such real estate commissions or
fees.   Section 22. ENVIRONMENTAL COVENANTS. Tenant shall comply with
all environmental laws, rules, regulations, statutes and ordinances,
including, without limitation, those applicable to "hazardous substances."
Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Landlord and its officers,
employees, agents, and contractors, from and against and to pay in full on
demand by Landlord all loss, cost and expense (including, without limitation,
attorneys\' fees and disbursements and fees of other professionals advising
Landlord) of whatever nature suffered or incurred by Landlord on account of
the existence on the Leased Premises, or the release or discharge from the
Leased Premises, of "hazardous substances," including, without limitation,
any claims, costs, losses, liabilities and expenses arising from the
violation (or claimed violation) of any environmental laws or the institution
of any action by any party against Tenant, Landlord or the Leased Premises
based upon nuisance, negligence or other tort theory alleging liability due
to the improper generation, storage, disposal, removal, transportation or
treatment of hazardous substances or the imposition of a lien on any part of
the Leased Premises under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq., as amended
("CERCLA"), and the Vermont Waste Management Statutes, Vt. Stat. Ann. Title
10, Ch. 159, or any other laws pursuant to which a lien or liability may be
imposed on Landlord (together, the "Hazardous Waste Liabilities") due to the
existence of hazardous substances, caused by Tenant or its employees, agents,
licensees, subtenants, and subcontractors.   Landlord shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Tenant and its officers, employees, agents, and
contractors, from and against any Hazardous Waste Liabilities suffered by
Tenant which are caused by Landlord, or Landlord\'s employees, agents,
licensees or subcontractors.   Section 23. LEASE NOT TO BE RECORDED. If this
Lease Agreement shall be recorded by or on behalf of Tenant, except at the
express request of Landlord, at the option of Landlord, it thereupon shall be
and become null, void and of no further force or effect, and all rights of
Tenant hereunder shall cease; provided, however, that the parties expressly
agree that a short-form notice of lease containing the information required
by 27 V.S.A.ss.341(c) and signed by both Landlord and Tenant, may be recorded
by either Landlord or Tenant.   Section 24. QUIET ENJOYMENT. Landlord
covenants that the said Tenant, on paying all rent required to be paid by
Tenant, and observing and performing all covenants and undertakings by Tenant
to be performed hereunder, shall and may peaceably have and enjoy said
Premises for the term aforesaid in accordance with the terms of this Lease
Agreement.    13   Section 25. NOTICES. Any notice or other communication

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the legal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. The term "Landlord"

other document or instrument required to be delivered pursuant hereto by
Landlord and Tenant have been duly authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, and this Lease and each other document or instrument required to

Landlord and Tenant and is    15  enforceable against Landlord and Tenant

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws at the
time in effect affecting the enforceability of the rights of creditors
generally.   Section 33. COUNTERPARTS. This Lease Agreement may be executed

which taken together shall be deemed to constitute one document.   Section
34. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, APPLICABLE LAW. This Lease Agreement with any exhibits
and riders attached hereto contains the entire agreement of the parties and
no representations, inducements, promises or agreements not embodied herein
shall be of any force or effect, unless the same are in writing and signed by

This Lease Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with

shall be obligated to lease from Landlord, and Landlord hereby agrees to rent
to Tenant the following additional space at the following times
(collectively, the "Expansion Premises") without any additional notice or
amendment to this Lease:   a. Being a portion of the ground floor of the
Building  containing approximately 3,000 additional square feet of  space,
more or less (the "Initial Ground Floor Expansion  Space") commencing on the
first day of the second Lease  Year. Tenant shall have the right to park an
additional 14  motor vehicles (for a total of 75) in the parking lot on  the
Lot in connection with the Initial Ground Floor  Expansion Space.   b.
Being a portion of the ground floor of the Building  containing approximately
3,750 additional square feet of  space, more or less (the "Additional Ground
Floor Expansion  Space") commencing on the first day of the third Lease 
Year. Tenant shall have the right to park an additional 15  motor vehicles
(for a total of 90) in the parking lot on  the Lot in connection with the
Additional Ground Floor  Expansion Space.   The terms, provisions and
conditions set forth in this Lease, including the rental provisions and
expiration date, shall govern the Expansion Premises.   Section 36. RIGHT
OF FIRST REFUSAL ON SECOND FLOOR SPACE. After the end of the third Lease
Year, Landlord grants Tenant a one time right of first refusal to lease all,
but not part, of the second floor of the Building under the following terms
and conditions.   a. If Landlord determines to lease the space on the
second  floor of the Building after the third Lease Year, Landlord  shall
notify Tenant in writing of the terms on which it  would be willing to lease
all, but not part, of the second    16   floor space ("Landlord\'s
Offer"). Tenant shall accept or  reject Landlord\'s Offer within ten (10)
days after receipt  thereof. If Tenant accepts Landlord\'s Offer, Landlord
shall  lease the second floor to Tenant on the terms of Landlord\'s  Offer
and a new lease, or an amendment to this Lease, on  terms acceptable to
Landlord and Tenant shall be signed  within thirty (30) days after Tenant
accepts Landlord\'s  Offer.   b. If Tenant does not accept Landlord\'s
Offer within ten (10)  days after receipt thereof, Tenant\'s right of first
refusal  under this Section shall terminate and Landlord may lease  all or
any part of the second floor space to any third  party on any terms
acceptable to Landlord.   Section 37. LANDLORD\'S RIGHT TO RELOCATE. During
the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall have the right to relocate Tenant to
separate, contiguous space of approximately the same square footage as then
in effect under this Lease (except for the 35 GMD Expansion Space) in the
building currently occupied by Landlord located on a parcel of land located
at 1400/1500 Shelburne Road (the "Relocation Space"). Such right to relocate
may only be exercised by Landlord\'s delivering written notice to Tenant of
its exercise of such right (the "Relocation Notice") no later than one
hundred eighty (180) days before the date of such relocation. The terms,
provisions and conditions set forth in this Lease, including the rental
provisions and expiration date, shall govern the Relocation Space, except
that the 35 GMD Expansion Space shall not be affected by such relocation.
Landlord shall pay all out of pocket costs incurred in connection with such
relocation. Such Relocation Space shall be appropriately segregated from
Landlord\'s space and Tenant shall be entitled to signage, at Landlord\'s
expense, comparable to the signage permitted at the Premises. Landlord shall
not be entitled to exercise this relocation right during the last Lease Year
of the original Term of this Lease unless Tenant has exercised its right to
extend the Term of the Lease in accordance with Section 2. In the
event Tenant exercises such right to extend the Term of the Lease, Landlord
shall not be entitled to exercise this relocation right during the last Lease
Year of the extended Term.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed
