transfer and delivery to Purchaser of the Purchased Assets, Purchaser shall
pay Seller one hundred fifty-five million dollars ($155,000,000) (the "
_Purchase Price_ "). At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a closing statement setting forth (A)
Sellers reasonable estimate of the Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount (the "
_Estimated Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount_ "), and (B) a calculation of the

follows:

 

(i) thirty million dollars ($30,000,000), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller (the " _Closing
Date Payment_ "); and

(ii) one hundred twenty-five million dollars ($125,000,000), minus (A) the
Estimated Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount that is held in bank accounts
controlled by Seller or its Affiliates as of the Closing (less any portion of
the Estimated Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount that is held in bank accounts of
Mavrix, Canton Renewables and CERF Shelby as of the Closing), plus (B) if
Seller is entitled to reimbursement for the Canton Debt Payoff Amount pursuant
to _Section 1.2(b)_ , the Canton Debt Payoff Amount (the " _Note Purchase
Price_ "), by delivery of an unsecured zero interest promissory note in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , in the original
principal amount of the Note Purchase Price and providing for a maturity date
of April 3, 2017 (the " _Purchase Price Note_ ").

After the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment in
accordance with  _Section 1.2(c)_.

(b) If Seller or Canton Renewables repays the amounts outstanding under the
Canton Loan Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.27_, Seller shall
be entitled to reimbursement of the Canton Debt Payoff Amount from Purchaser.

 

(c) The Parties hereby covenant and agree as provided in this _Section
1.2(c)_ with respect to the adjustment of the Purchase Price following the
Closing:

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (but in no event
later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date), Seller shall prepare
and deliver to Purchaser a calculation of the Acquired Cash and the Adjusted
Acquired Cash Amount (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ "). If the Adjusted
Acquired Cash Amount, as calculated by Seller, exceeds the Estimated Adjusted
Acquired Cash Amount, Seller shall contemporaneously pay the amount of such
excess to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Purchaser, and if the Adjusted Acquired Cash
Amount, as calculated by Seller, is less than the Estimated Adjusted Acquired
Cash Amount, Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within forty-five (45)
days of the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement) pay the amount of such
shortfall to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Seller, unless any such amount is disputed by
Purchaser in accordance with an Objection Notice as set forth in _Section
1.2(c)(iii)_ below.

(ii) Following the delivery of the Post-Closing Statement to Purchaser,
Seller shall provide Purchaser and its designees reasonable access upon
reasonable advance written notice during normal business hours to all
materials of Seller pertinent to the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement
and calculations of the Acquired Cash and the Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount
as set forth on _Schedule 1.2(c)(ii)_.

(iii) The Post-Closing Statement and the Acquired Cash and the Adjusted
Acquired Cash Amount submitted by Seller to Purchaser shall become final and
binding upon the Parties

 



\- 5 -  forty-five (45) days following Purchasers receipt thereof (the " _Review
Period_ "), unless Purchaser, within the Review Period, has delivered to
Seller written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") of its objections with
reasonable detail and specificity to the Post-Closing Statement, the Acquired
Cash and the Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount, in which case the Post-Closing
Statement, the Acquired Cash and the Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount shall not
be binding upon the Parties and such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
_Section 1.2(c)(iv)_.

 

(iv) After the receipt of the Objection Notice by Seller, the designees of
Purchaser and Seller shall meet by telephone, or at a mutually agreeable
location, to discuss and attempt to reconcile their differences with respect
to the disputed items set forth in the Objection Notice (the " _Disputed
Items_ "). If the Parties are unable to mutually resolve each of the Disputed
Items within twenty (20) days after receipt of the Objection Notice by Seller,
then Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage the Accounting Firm to resolve
such Disputed Items and promptly submit such dispute for resolution to the
Accounting Firm. The Parties shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm to
make a determination within thirty (30) days after its engagement or as soon
as practicable thereafter. The Accounting Firms determination shall be
limited to resolving the disagreement set forth in the Objection Notice. The
determination of the Accounting Firm and any required adjustments resulting
therefrom shall be final, conclusive and binding on all the Parties hereto.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between and
paid by Purchaser and/or Seller, respectively, based upon the percentage that
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by the Accounting
Firm.

(v) On the fifth (5th) Business Day after the final determination of the
Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount in accordance with this _Section 1.2(c)_ :

 

(1) if the final Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount is less than the Estimated
Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by
Seller, an amount equal to such difference (A) plus any amount previously paid
by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 1.2(c)(i)_ , (B) minus any amount
previously paid by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to _Section 1.2(c)(i)_ ; and

 

(2) if the final Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount is greater than the
Estimated Adjusted Acquired Cash Amount, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in
writing by Purchaser, an amount equal to such difference (A) plus any amount
previously paid by Purchaser to Seller pursuant to  _Section 1.2(c)(i)_ , (B)
minus any amount previously paid by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to _Section
1.2(c)(i)_.

 

Section 1.3 _Earn Out_.

 

(a) In addition to the Purchase Price, Seller shall have the opportunity to
earn, and Purchaser shall pay, subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_, additional cash proceeds, which will be an upward
adjustment to the Purchase Price, in an aggregate amount not to exceed twenty-
five million dollars ($25,000,000), calculated and determined in the manner
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_.

(b) Purchaser shall pay Seller an annual earn-out payment (the " _Annual_
_Earn-Out Payment_") (if any) for each of the first five (5) calendar years
from January 1, 2017 (each an " _Earn Out Year_ "), with the calendar year
ending December 31, 2017, referred to as " _Year One_ ," the calendar year
ending December 31, 2018, referred to as " _Year Two_ ," the calendar year
ending December 31, 2019, referred to as " _Year Three_ ," the calendar year
ending December 31, 2020, referred to as " _Year Four_ " and the calendar year
ending December 31, 2021, referred to as " _Year Five_ ," to be calculated as
set forth on _Schedule 1.3(b)_.

 



\- 6 - (c) Within sixty (60) days after the end of an applicable Earn-Out Year,
Purchaser shall (i) prepare or cause to be prepared a statement setting forth:
(A) following Year One, the calculation of the Annual Earn-Out
Payment applicable to Year One; (B) following Year Two, the calculation of
the Annual Earn-Out Payment applicable to Year Two; (C) following Year Three,
the calculation of the Annual Earn-Out Payment applicable to Year Three; (D)
following Year Four, the calculation of the Annual Earn-Out Payment applicable
to Year Four and (E) following Year Five, the calculation of the Annual Earn-
Out Payment applicable to Year Five (with respect to each Earn-Out Year, an "
_Earn-Out Calculation_") and (ii) deliver the applicable Earn-Out Calculation
to Seller, together with (A) reasonable supporting documents and (B) payment
to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Seller, of the Annual Earn-Out Payment, if any,
calculated by Purchaser to be payable based on such Earn-Out Calculation.
Seller shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable
Earn-Out Calculation with respect to the applicable Earn-Out Year to notify
Purchaser in writing of Sellers election to accept or reject such Earn-Out
Calculation as prepared by Purchaser. In the event Seller rejects in writing
such Earn-Out Calculation as prepared by Purchaser, such rejection notice (the
" _Rejection Notice_ ") shall contain the reasons for such rejection in
reasonable detail and set forth the amount of the requested adjustment. In
the event no Rejection Notice is received by Purchaser during such thirty
(30)-day period, the Annual Earn-Out Payment for such Earn-Out Year (as set
forth in Purchasers Earn-Out Calculation) shall be deemed to have been
accepted and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto. In
the event that Seller shall timely reject an Earn-Out Calculation, Purchaser
and Seller shall promptly (and in any event within thirty (30) days following
the date upon which Purchaser received the applicable Rejection Notice from
Seller rejecting such Earn-Out Calculation) attempt in good faith to make a
joint determination of the Annual Earn-Out Payment for the applicable Earn-
Out Year, and such determination and any required adjustments resulting
therefrom shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto. In the
event Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the Annual Earn-Out
Payment for the applicable Earn-Out Year within such thirty (30)-day period,
then Purchaser and Seller shall jointly engage the Accounting Firm to resolve
such dispute and promptly submit such dispute for resolution to the Accounting
Firm. The Parties shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm to make a
determination within thirty (30) days after its engagement or as soon as
practicable thereafter. The Accounting Firms determination shall be limited
to resolving the disagreement set forth in the Rejection Notice. The
determination of the Accounting Firm and any required adjustments resulting
therefrom shall be final, conclusive and binding on all the Parties hereto.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between and
paid by Purchaser and/or Seller, respectively, based upon the percentage that
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to the
amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by the Accounting Firm.

 

(d) If the Annual Earn-Out Payment due on account of any Earn-Out Year, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.3(c)_, is greater than the amount
(if any) initially paid by Purchaser on account of such Earn-Out Year, then
the additional Annual Earn-Out Payment due shall be payable within five (5)
days of such final determination pursuant to _Section 1.3(c)_ , and Purchaser
shall deliver to Seller such additional amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by Seller to
Purchaser.

 

(e) For the purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_, Purchaser shall cooperate with and make available to
Seller all pertinent books, records and data, and shall permit reasonable
access to its facilities and personnel upon reasonable advance written notice
and during normal business hours, as may be reasonably required in connection
with the preparation and analysis of the Earn-Out Calculation for any Earn-Out
Year and the resolution of any disputes thereunder as set forth on  _Schedule
1.3(e)_. In addition, Purchaser shall also provide such access upon request by
Seller and cooperate with Seller in connection with making interim
calculations of amounts due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_. If
Purchaser breaches its obligations under this _Section 1.3(e)_ , the dispute
period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ shall be automatically extended until
such breach is cured by Purchaser.

 



\- 7 - (f) From and after the Closing Date and through and including
the expiration of Year Five, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause any Affiliate of Purchaser to: (i) not sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any asset that is necessary or required in
connection with the production or sale of renewable natural gas or related
RINS or LCFS Credits; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the
sale of renewable natural gas and the related RINS or LCFS Credits pursuant to
applicable supply agreements and to seek an extension of any RIN Contract or
LCFS Contracts; (iii) cause the books and records of the Business set forth on
_Schedule 1.3(e)_ to be maintained in a manner that will provide the
information necessary for the calculation of the Annual Earn-Out Payment;
(iv) not accelerate, delay, hinder or prevent the production or sale of
renewable natural gas or the related RINS or LCFS Credits in any manner that
is not consistent with Sellers operation of the Business prior to the
Closing Date; and (v) not take any action with respect to the Business that
has as its purpose or will likely result in artificial reduction of the
revenues of the Business or the resulting RINS or LCFS Credits.

(g) In the event that Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person has
a Liquidated Claim against Seller under this Agreement, including a
Liquidated Claim for Losses under _ARTICLE VII_ , Purchaser may withhold and
offset the amount of such Liquidated Claim against any Annual Earn-Out
Payment(s) owed to Seller under this _Section_ __ _ 1.3_ until either (i) the
Liquidated Claim is satisfied in full or (ii) the Annual Earn-Out Payment(s)
owed to Seller are completely exhausted; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 1.3(g)_ shall limit Purchasers or the Purchaser Indemnified Persons
ability to recover the full amount of any such Liquidated Claim.

Section 1.4 _Closing_. Unless mutually agreed otherwise by the Parties,
the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities will take place at the offices of Seller no later than the

deliver any Purchased Asset or for Purchaser to assume any Assumed Liability
that by its terms or by Law is not transferable or assignable, as applicable,
without the consent or waiver of a third party or is terminable or cancelable
by a third party in the event of such a transfer or assignment without the
consent or waiver of such third party (collectively, the " _Non-Assignable
Assets_"), in each case unless and until such consent or waiver has been
obtained.

 



\- 10 - (b) Seller will, and will cause its applicable Affiliates to, use its
and their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to cause to be
obtained, any consent or waiver that is required for Seller and its Affiliates
to sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver the Purchased Assets to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ of
the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
the third party to any Purchased Asset conditions its grant of a consent
(including by threatening to exercise a "recapture" or other termination
right) upon, or otherwise requires in response to a notice or consent request
regarding this Agreement, the payment of a consent fee or other consideration,
or the provision of additional security (including a guaranty), Seller will
not be required to make any such payments or to provide any such additional
security. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and except for any
Contract that is listed on _Schedule 5.1(a)(i)_ or  _Schedule 5.1(a)(ii)_ ,
in the event any such consent or waiver cannot be obtained prior to Closing,
(i) the Non-Assignable Assets subject thereto and affected thereby will be
held, as of and from the Closing, by Seller or its Affiliates in trust for
the benefit of Purchaser, and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder
will be for Purchasers account; (ii) Seller will pay, perform and otherwise
discharge (in accordance with the respective terms and subject to the
respective conditions thereof) all of the covenants and obligations under such
Non-Assignable Assets and Purchaser will reimburse Seller for any payments
made by Seller under such Non-Assignable Assets; (iii) Seller and its
Subsidiaries will take or cause to be taken, subject to the second sentence of
this _Section 1.7(b)_ , such actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser
may reasonably request so as to provide Purchaser with the benefits of such
Non-Assignable Assets and to, using commercially reasonable efforts, effect
the collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable
under such Non-Assignable Assets and to pay over to Purchaser all money or
other consideration received by it in respect of such Non-Assignable Assets
and (iv) Purchaser and Seller will, and Seller will cause its Affiliates to,
collectively cooperate to provide any other alternative arrangements as may be
reasonably required to implement the purposes of this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements. If and when such consent or waiver is obtained, Seller
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, sell, transfer, assign, convey and
deliver such Non-Assignable Asset to Purchaser or its applicable Subsidiaries
for no additional consideration.

 

Section 1.8 _Retention of Records_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.20_,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller
and its Affiliates may retain, at its expense, copies of all Purchased
Contracts, Purchased Books and Records and other documents or materials
conveyed hereunder.

 

Section 1.9 _Bulk Sales Law_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Seller
with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or
any similar Laws of any jurisdiction, including Article 6 of the California
Uniform Commercial Code, that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the
sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser.

Section 1.10 _Tax Withholding_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any of the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld by Purchaser and timely delivered by Purchaser to
the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Party as
consideration pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in good faith to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any such withholding.

 



\- 11 - Section 1.11 _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
for comparable state and local Tax purposes), Purchaser and Seller agree to
treat (i) the sale of the membership interests in Mavrix as the purchase by
Purchaser of each of Mavrixs assets, which are treated as held directly by
Seller for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii) the sale of the
membership interests in Eagle Point and Oklahoma as a sale of interests in an
entity taxable as a partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set
forth herein will require Seller and Purchaser to agree upon a more detailed
Purchase Price allocation among the Purchased Assets sold, transferred,
conveyed and assigned by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein
shall require Purchaser and Seller to jointly prepare or agree upon an
allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets under Section 1060
of the Code (or any similar or comparable provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law).

presentations, budgets and financial data and reports); _provided_ that
Purchaser does not hereby waive any claim for actual fraud, gross negligence

\- 27 - Section 4.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Each Party shall bear fifty percent (50%) of any and all applicable
sales, use, transfer or similar Taxes that may be imposed, assessed or
payable by reason of or relating to the consummation of the Transactions,
including the sales, transfers, leases, rentals, licenses and assignments
contemplated hereby (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ");  _provided_ that
Purchaser shall bear one hundred percent (100%) of the Incremental Transfer
Tax. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize
Transfer Taxes, if any. The Party required by applicable Law to file a Tax
Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes will do so within the time period
prescribed by applicable Law and will pay all Transfer Taxes required to be
paid in connection therewith; ___provided_ , ___however_ , that the non-filing
Party will promptly (but in any event within ten (10) Business Days of its
receipt of written notice from the filing Party) reimburse the filing Party
for fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes so paid by the filing Party,
unless such Transfer Taxes constitute an Incremental Transfer Tax, in which
case the Parties shall make such payments as are necessary so that Purchaser
bears one hundred percent (100%) of such Incremental Transfer Tax. 

(b) Responsibility for ad valorem or other similar Taxes (" _Property
Taxes_ ") levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Valuation Date will be apportioned
between Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, based on
the number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Valuation Date
Tax Period and the number of days of such taxable period included in the Post-
Valuation Date Tax Period, respectively. To the extent that any portion of
such Property Taxes is paid or required by Law to be paid by one Party hereto
but required by the foregoing to be borne by another Party hereto, such other
Party shall promptly reimburse the paying Party for the proper portion of the
Property Tax required to be so borne upon notice from the paying Party of the
amount of such Property Tax paid. Each Party shall timely and duly cause to be
filed all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all Property
Taxes subject to this _Section 4.7_ _(b)_ that are required by Law to be
filed by such Party and shall pay to the relevant Taxing Authority all such
Property Taxes that are required to be paid by such Party (subject to such
reimbursement as provided for herein).

 

(c) Any and all Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets or to the
Business, other than Transfer Taxes, Property Taxes and Taxes due with
respect to Interim Taxable Income, will be borne by Seller with respect to the
Pre-Valuation Date Tax Period and by Purchaser with respect to the Post-
Valuation Date Tax Period, and each Party will indemnify, defend and hold the
other Party harmless from and against all Taxes for which such Party is liable
pursuant to this _Section 4.7(c)_. For purposes of this _Section 4.7(c)_ : (x)
the amount of any Taxes that are based on or measured by income, receipts or
expenditures and that are allocable to the Pre-Valuation Date Tax Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the Valuation
Date; and (y) the amount of all other Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-
Valuation Date Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in such taxable period ending on the Valuation Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to net
taxable income recognized by Seller (or the direct or indirect owners of
Seller) as a result of its ownership of the Purchased Assets on the Valuation
Date through and including the Closing Date (" _Interim Taxable Income_ "),
(i) Seller (or its direct and indirect owners) shall retain responsibility
for the payment of any U.S. federal and state income Taxes due with respect to
such Interim Taxable Income but (ii) the aggregate amount of any
indemnification claims of Purchaser (and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns) payable pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_
shall be reduced and offset by an amount equal to the (A) the highest U.S.
federal and California state marginal income tax rate applicable to a
corporation multiplied by (B) the amount of such Interim Taxable Income.

 



\- 28 - (e) The Parties hereto agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
one another, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the preparation for any audit by
any Taxing Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim or
proceeding relating to any Tax Return. In the event that any Taxing Authority
informs Seller or Purchaser of any notice of a proposed audit, claim,
assessment or other dispute concerning an amount of Taxes related to the
Business or the Purchased Assets with respect to which the other Party may be
liable hereunder, the Party so informed will promptly notify the other Party
of such matter; _provided_ that failure to promptly notify will not reduce
the other Partys indemnity obligation hereunder, except to the extent such
Partys ability to defend against such matter is actually prejudiced thereby;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that resolution of such audit, claim, assessment
or other dispute will be governed by _Section_ __ _ 7.4_.

 

Section 4.8 _Employment of Business Employees_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, offer employment as of the Closing Date to each Business
Employee, subject to and conditional on (i) Purchasers customary pre-
employment checks and (ii) the Closing having occurred. The Business Employees
who accept an employment offer from Purchaser or any of its Affiliates on the
Closing Date are referred to as the " _Transferred Employees_ " as of the
Closing Date.

 

(b) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, credit Transferred
Employees for service earned prior to the Closing Date with Seller and its
Affiliates where required by applicable Law; _provided_ that nothing herein
shall result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the Transferred
Employees.

 

(c) Seller and its Affiliates shall not change the terms of employment of
any of the Business Employees, nor make any representations about their
continued future employment (including counter employment offers) with Seller
or any of its Affiliates or otherwise encourage any Business Employee to
reject Purchasers or its Affiliates employment offer.

 

Section 4.9 _Employee Plans_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall not assume any obligations under or Liabilities with
respect to, or receive any right or interest in any trusts relating to, any
assets of or any insurance, administration or other contracts pertaining to
any of the Employee Plans.

 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all
Transferred Employees will cease, effective as of the Closing Date, any
participation in and any benefit accrual under each of the Employee Plans.
Seller and its Affiliates shall take all necessary actions to effect such
cessation of Transferred Employees participation under the Employee Plans.
Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for paying the Transferred
Employees for any accrued benefits under the Employee Plans. Notwithstanding
the first sentence of this _Section 4.9(b)_ , Transferred Employees may
continue after the Closing Date to participate in those Employee Plans
specified in _Schedule 4.9(b)_ that provide health, sickness, short term and
long term disability, severance, workers compensation, life insurance or
similar benefits with respect to claims incurred by the Transferred Employees
and their eligible spouses, dependents or qualified beneficiaries, as
applicable, on or prior to the Closing Date.

until the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, (a) Seller shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, without

Purchasers Affiliates for employment in the biogas or gas supply business of
Seller or its Affiliates, or otherwise solicit any such Person to leave the
employ of Purchaser or Purchasers Affiliates for purposes of employment in
the biogas or gas supply business of Seller or its Affiliates, and (b)
Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of Seller, solicit any employee
of Seller or Sellers Affiliates listed on  _Schedule 4.10_ for employment in
the biogas or gas supply business of Purchaser or its Affiliates, or otherwise
solicit any such Person to leave the employ of Seller or Sellers Affiliates
for purposes of employment in the biogas or gas supply business of Purchaser
or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the foregoing shall not
restrict or preclude any Party or its Affiliates from hiring, employing or
contracting any person as a result of general solicitations not specifically
directed at the other Party, the other Partys Affiliates or the foregoings
employees.

 

Section 4.11 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by Seller prior to the Closing, or for any other reasonable purpose,
Purchaser shall for a period of five (5) years after the Closing: (i) retain
the books and records (including personnel files) relating to periods prior to
the Closing that are included in the Purchased Assets in a manner reasonably
consistent with the prior practices of Seller and (ii) upon reasonable notice,

make, at Purchasers expense, photocopies), during normal business hours, to
such books and records.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be
obligated to provide the other party with access to any books or records
(including personnel files) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_ where such
access would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege or (ii)
contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.12 _Governmental Approvals and Consents_.

 

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall each file or cause to be filed, promptly
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Agreement Date,
any initial filings required under the HSR Act. Purchaser and Seller shall
each bear the costs and expenses of their respective filings, but Purchaser
and Seller shall each pay one-half (1/2) of the filing fees in connection
therewith.

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, Purchaser and
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use their
respective best efforts to respond to any formal or informal requests for
additional information made by any Governmental Authority and to cause the
waiting periods or other requirements under the HSR Act and all other
applicable antitrust or competition laws to terminate or expire at the
earliest possible date (including, with respect to filings under the HSR Act,

shall, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, (i) promptly provide
written notification to Purchaser of any Proceeding of which it is aware which
requires such disclosure, the nature of such information to be disclosed, and
a description of the legal provisions requiring such disclosure, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to limit or prevent such disclosure, and (iii)
if disclosure is ultimately required, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure

the Transactions, and upon such request the Parties shall (a) include such
Contract in the Supply Agreement and (b) supplement _Schedule 1.1(a)(ii)_ to
list such additional Purchased Contract (and, _provided_ Seller has delivered
to Purchaser a true and correct copy of such Contract, the supplement to

breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement with
respect to such Contract for purposes of the indemnification rights contained

(a) Seller shall have no liability for Losses solely for breaches of
representations and warranties set forth in  _ARTICLE II_ unless and until
the aggregate amount of Losses for all claims asserted by the Indemnified
Party exceeds the Basket, in which event Seller shall only pay and be liable
for Losses in excess of the Basket. The foregoing limitations shall not apply
to claims based upon breaches of Fundamental Representations and actual fraud,
gross negligence or criminal misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates,
with respect to which, in each case, Losses in connection therewith shall
be recoverable from the first dollar and shall not be counted in determining
whether the threshold set forth in the preceding sentence has been exceeded.
For the sole purpose of determining any Losses with respect 

 



\- 38 -  to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant by Seller for
purposes of indemnification under this _ARTICLE VII_ (and not for determining
whether or not any breaches of representations, warranties or covenants have
occurred), any qualification or limitation of a representation, warranty or
covenant by reference to materiality of matters stated therein or as to
matters having or not having a "Material Adverse Effect," "materiality" or
words of similar effect shall be disregarded.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers
aggregate Liability for indemnification pursuant to subsection _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ will not exceed $15,500,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that notwithstanding the foregoing the Cap will not apply with respect to
(i) any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ based on any
breach of a Fundamental Representation, for which Sellers Liability
for indemnification, together with any Liability for indemnification
otherwise pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ in the aggregate will not exceed the
Purchase Price, or (ii) actual fraud, gross negligence or criminal misconduct
of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
will any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_
after the applicable Expiration Date set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ unless
a Claim Notice was delivered prior to such time.

that would result from the set of facts giving rise to such Losses
constituting a breach or other violation of more than one representation,
warranty or covenant hereunder.

 

(e) There will be no obligation to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ to
the extent the Loss relates to any breach of representation, warranty or
covenant expressly waived in writing by the Indemnified Party.

AGREE THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES, AND THE RECOVERY
BY AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY OF ANY LOSSES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY IT AS A RESULT
OF ANY BREACH OR NONFULFILLMENT BY A PARTY OF ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES, COVENANTS, AGREEMENTS OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT,
SHALL, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF ACTUAL FRAUD, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR CRIMINAL
MISCONDUCT, BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING FROM SUCH BREACH OR
NONFULFILLMENT AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE BY THE PARTIES AS OF THE DATE OF
THIS AGREEMENT, BUT NOT DAMAGES INDIRECTLY ARISING FROM SUCH BREACH OR
NONFULFILLMENT, AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE OR APPLY TO, NOR SHALL ANY INDEMNIFIED
PARTY BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER, ANY INDIRECT, SPECULATIVE, REMOTE, EXEMPLARY OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY SUCH INDEMNIFIED PARTY. For purposes
of the foregoing, Losses may include indirect, speculative, remote, exemplary
or punitive damages to the extent (i) the injuries or losses resulting in or
giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by a third party who is
not an Affiliate of a Party, and (ii) such damages are recovered against an
Indemnified Party by a Person that is a third party who is not an Affiliate of
a Party. This _Section 7.3(f)_ shall operate only to limit a Partys
liability and shall not operate to increase or expand any contractual
obligation of a Party.

 

(g) No Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification under this
_ARTICLE VII_ with respect to any Third Party Claim unless and until the
final amount of recoverable Losses (if any) are determined by a final, non-
appealable judgment or award, or settlement entered into in accordance with
this _ARTICLE VII_ , in each case that is binding on such Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party.

 



\- 39 - Section 7.4 _Notice of Claims_.

 

(a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens
or asserts any Proceeding that may give rise to Losses for which a party (an
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification under this
_ARTICLE VII_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") has a claim
to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third Party
Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party will promptly send to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") specifying (to
the extent known) in reasonable detail the nature of such claim and the amount
of all related Losses (the " _Claim Amount_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that any failure to give such Claim Notice or to provide any such facts or
amounts will not affect the rights of the Indemnified Parties, except to the
extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled, but not obligated, to assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim at its expense if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice from
the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, if there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same
counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party,
then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to retain its own counsel, as is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the expense of the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the Indemnifying Party is
Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or direct
the defense of any such Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third
Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, if the Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly, is conducting
the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the
Indemnified Party all such witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in the Indemnifying Partys possession or under the Indemnifying
Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Party will have any
obligation to make available to the Indemnifying Party any information if
making such information available would (i) jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement (including any confidentiality agreement to which the Indemnified
Party is a party) (it being understood that Indemnified Party will cooperate
in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable otherwise
required disclosure to the Indemnifying Party to occur without contravening
such Law, duty or agreement).

(c) No Third Party Claim that is being defended by the Indemnifying Party
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be settled by the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
withheld) unless (i) the terms of the proposed settlement include as an
unconditional and with-prejudice term thereof the granting by the third party
to any relevant Indemnified Party a release from all Liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim; (ii) there is (A) no finding or admission of any
violation of Law by any Indemnified Party and (B) no finding or admission of
any violation of the rights of any Person by any Indemnified Party; and (iii)
the sole form of relief is monetary damages that will be paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party. No Third Party Claim that is being defended by the
Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be
settled by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or withheld) unless the Indemnified Party agrees to bear the Liability for
such settlement.

 



\- 40 - (d) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party will
have thirty (30) days from receipt of a Claim Notice to deliver a written
statement objecting to the Direct Claim made in such Claim Notice explaining
in reasonable detail and in good faith the basis for such objection. If the
Indemnifying Party has not delivered to the Indemnified Party such written
statement within such thirty (30)-day period, then (i) the Indemnifying Party
will be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to object to
such Indemnification Claim and to have agreed that Losses in the amount of
the applicable Claim Amount are indemnifiable hereunder, and (ii) as promptly
as practicable and within five (5) Business Days following expiration of such
thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party will cause the Claim Amount to
be paid to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to a bank account designated in writing to the Indemnifying Party
within two (2) Business Days of the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period.
If not paid, the Indemnified Party may seek enforcement of the obligation with
respect to the Indemnification Claim in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) If an Indemnifying Party objects in writing to any Direct Claim made
in any Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective Parties with
respect to each of such Direct Claim. If the Parties should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by both
Parties. As promptly as practicable, and within five (5) Business Days
following execution of such memorandum, the Indemnifying Party will cause the
Claim Amount specified in the executed memorandum to be paid to the
Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing to the Indemnifying Party within two (2)
Business Days following execution of such memorandum. If not paid,
the Indemnified Party may seek enforcement of the obligation with respect to
the Indemnification Claim in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

Section 7.5 _Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy; Specific Performance_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, except
in the case of actual fraud, gross negligence or criminal misconduct and
except as provided in _Section 1.2(c)(iv)_ and _Section 1.3(c)_ , the
indemnification provided in this _ARTICLE VII_  will be the sole and
exclusive remedy for any claims after the Closing Date arising under or
relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Party would be damaged irreparably if any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that the other
Party will be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the provisions
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof (including the indemnification provisions hereof) in any
competent court having jurisdiction over the Parties, in addition to any
other remedy to which they may be entitled at Law or in equity.

 

Section 7.6 _No Set-Off_. Purchaser will not have any right to set off
any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ against,
and there will not otherwise be any right to set off or counterclaim in the
event of the non-performance of any obligation to make, (a) any payment due
pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any payment due under any other Transaction
Agreement or (c) any payment due under the Supply Agreement or any other
agreement with Seller or one of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have a right of set-off as provided in _Section
1.3(g)_.

 

Section 7.7 _Effect of Insurance; Mitigation_.

 

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this _ARTICLE VII_ will be reduced by any amounts that are recovered by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates from any insurance proceeds or
other cash receipts or source of reimbursement that may be received by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Losses (each
such source, a " _Collateral Source_ "), net of any reasonable out-of-pocket
costs of pursuing such recovery, any premium 

 



\- 41 -  adjustments and any self-insured retentions. The Indemnified Party will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, diligently pursue all available remedies and
causes of action to recover the amount of its claim as may be available from
any Collateral Source.

(b) In the event that an Indemnified Party willfully fails to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Losses associated with an
indemnifiable claim, the Indemnifying Party will have no liability for any
portion of such Losses that reasonably could have been avoided had the
Indemnified Party not willfully failed to so use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate.

Section 7.8 _Effect of Investigation_. The representations, warranties
and covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that
any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any condition set forth in
_ARTICLE V_.

 

Section 7.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE VII_ as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes, including
for U.S. federal income tax and for state tax purposes.

 

Section 7.10 _No Contribution by the Acquired Entities_. None of Mavrix,
Canton Renewables or CERF Shelby will have any liability to any Indemnifying
Party as a result of (a) any misrepresentation or breach of representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or any certificate, schedule, instrument,
agreement or other writing delivered by or on behalf of, or in respect of,
Mavrix, Canton Renewables or CERF Shelby pursuant to this Agreement, or any
certificate, schedule, instrument, agreement, or other writing delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated this Agreement or (b) the
breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any
certificate, schedule, instrument, agreement, or other writing by or on behalf
of, or in respect of, Mavrix, Canton Renewables or CERF Shelby pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement or any certificate, schedule, instrument, agreement,

(a) This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party by operation of law or
otherwise, except with the prior written consent of the other Parties;
_provided_ that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to any Affiliate of Purchaser without the prior written consent of
Seller; _provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve
Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.

(b) Any attempted or purported assignment of this Agreement that does not
comply with this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ will be null and void, have no force or
effect and confer no rights upon any third parties. Subject to compliance with
the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the provisions of this
Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors, assigns and transferees.

 

Section 8.6 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in this Agreement,
irrespective of whether the Closing is consummated, each Party will pay all
costs and expenses that it incurs with respect to the negotiation, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other documents or
agreements contemplated hereby.

 

Section 8.7 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified except by an agreement in writing signed by
Purchaser and Seller. No waiver will be effective unless it is in writing and
is signed by the Party asserted to have granted such waiver.

 

Section 8.8 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable will be ineffective to the extent of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof, and the
remaining provisions will be construed and enforced in all respects as if
such invalid or unenforceable provision or provisions had been omitted and
substituted with a provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and most
closely effectuates the original intent of this Agreement. The invalidity of
a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction will not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 8.9 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement will be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and
permitted assigns, and, except as expressly provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or will confer
upon any other Persons any rights or remedies hereunder.

Section 8.10 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) As used in this Agreement, references to the Preamble or to the
Recitals, Articles, Sections, subsections, clauses, Annexes, Schedules or
Exhibits are to the Preamble or a Recital or Section, subsection, clause or
Article of, or an Annex, Schedules or Exhibit to, this Agreement unless
otherwise specified.

 

(b) The various headings and subheadings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and do not limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Any singular term in this Agreement will be deemed to include the
plural and any plural term the singular. All pronouns and variations of
pronouns will be deemed to refer to the feminine, masculine or neuter,
singular or plural, as the identity of the Person referred to may require.

 



\- 44 - (d) For purposes of the provisions of this Agreement, a document or
other instrument shall be deemed to have been "provided," "furnished,"
"delivered" or "made available" to Purchaser only when such document or other
instrument has been uploaded onto the Data Room no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day prior to the Agreement Date in a manner fully readable by
Purchaser and not removed prior to the Closing.

 

(e) The Schedules and Exhibits identified in this Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule, are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of
this Agreement.

Section 8.11 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each Party agrees
that it has been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution
of this Agreement and, therefore, waives the application of any applicable Law
or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

 

Section 8.12 _Counterparts; Electronic Signature_. This Agreement may be
executed in two (2) or more counterparts (by original or facsimile
signature), each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of copies
of this Agreement, or any amendment hereto, any signature pages required
hereunder or thereunder by facsimile or Portable Document Format (" _PDF_ ")
transmission will constitute effective execution and delivery of same as to
the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original document for
all purposes. Signature transmitted by facsimile or PDF will be deemed to be
original signatures for all purposes.

 

Section 8.13 _Counsel_. Purchaser acknowledges that both Sellers in-
house and outside counsel (collectively, " _Counsel_ ") represents only Seller
and not the Business in the Transactions and that any advice given to or
communication with Seller by Counsel to the extent it was (a) primarily
related to the Transactions (and not for the general business purposes of
Mavrix, Canton Renewables or CERF Shelby), and (b) given or communicated on or
after May 1, 2016 (" _Transaction Advice_ "), is not and will not be subject
to any joint privilege and is and will be owned solely by Seller. Seller
acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with Seller by Counsel
to the extent it was (i) given or communicated prior to May 1, 2016, or (ii)
for the general business purposes of Mavrix, Canton Renewables or CERF Shelby
(whether given or communicated before, on or after May 1, 2016) is not subject
to any joint privilege and is and will be owned solely by Mavrix, Canton
Renewables or CERF Shelby, as applicable. The attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection and expectation of client confidence arising
from Counsels representation of the Business prior to the Closing to the
extent primarily related to the Transaction Advice, and all information and
documents covered by such privilege or protection, will belong to and be
controlled by Seller or Counsel and may be waived only by Seller or Counsel,
and not Purchaser or the Business, and will not pass to or be claimed or used
by Purchaser or the Business; _provided_ that Purchaser, Mavrix, Canton
Renewables or CERF Shelby may assert the privilege in any Proceeding against a
third party. Purchaser acknowledges that Counsel have acted as counsel for
Seller and that, in the event of any post-Closing matters or disputes between
the parties hereto, Seller anticipates that Counsel will represent it in such
matters or disputes. Purchaser consents to Counsels representation of Seller
in any post-Closing matter or dispute in which the interests of Purchaser or
the Business, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, are adverse,
whether or not such matter or dispute is substantially related to one in
which Counsel may have previously advised the Business. Purchaser consents to
the disclosure by Counsel to Seller of any information learned or documents or
communications prepared by Counsel in the course of their representation of
the Business prior to Closing to the extent related to the Transaction Advice
(" _Work Product_ "), whether or not such information is subject to the
attorney-client privilege or Counsels duty of confidentiality as to the
Business and whether or not such disclosure is made before or after the
Closing.

 



\- 45 - Section 8.14 _Parent Guaranties_.

 

(a) In order to induce Purchaser and Purchaser Guarantor to execute and
deliver this Agreement, Seller Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees in full the due, punctual and full payment of Sellers
(including its permitted designees and assigns) payment obligations
hereunder when due (and including in connection with any breach of any of
Sellers representations or warranties or covenants and agreements herein),
subject to any and all limitations expressly provided hereunder. If Seller
fails or refuses to timely pay any such obligations and liabilities, Seller
Parent shall promptly pay such obligations or liabilities after any such
failure or refusal, as applicable. The obligations of Seller Parent under this
_Section 8.14(a)_ shall survive the Closing and/or termination of this
Agreement and continue in full force and effect thereafter.

this Agreement, Purchaser Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees in full the due, punctual and full payment of
Purchasers (including its permitted designees and assigns) payment
obligations hereunder (including under the Purchase Price Note) when due (and
including in connection with any breach of any of Purchasers representations
or warranties or covenants and agreements herein), subject to any and all
limitations expressly provided hereunder; _provided_ that Purchaser
Guarantors guaranty of Purchasers payment obligations shall not exceed (i)
$180,000,000 in the aggregate until the repayment in full of the Purchase
Price Note, and (ii) $25,000,000 in the aggregate after the repayment in full
of the Purchase Price Note. If Purchaser fails or refuses to timely pay any
such obligations and liabilities, Purchaser Guarantor shall promptly pay such
obligations or liabilities after any such failure or refusal, as applicable,
subject to the aggregate limitation set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence. The obligations of Purchaser Guarantor under this _Section 8.14(b)_
shall survive the Closing and/or termination of this Agreement and continue
in full force and effect thereafter.
