paid to the appropriate taxing authority in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Seller in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. Without limiting the
foregoing, and in lieu of deducting from any payment, the applicable Withholding Agent may require that any Seller make arrangements
satisfactory to such applicable Withholding Agent to satisfy any withholding requirements as a condition to making any payment
(including, for example, in an instance where payment is to be made in shares of Parent Common Stock);&nbsp;<U>provided</U>, that
any Seller may request that such applicable Withholding Agent accept commercially reasonable arrangements (including sell to cover
arrangements) with respect to satisfying such withholding requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any compensatory
payments for Tax purposes payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid through the payroll system of
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, any such amount withheld shall
reduce the cash consideration payable to such Seller regardless of whether the withholding is in respect of cash or equity consideration
payable hereunder.</P>

all of the properties, and interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected on the Company Balance Sheet or acquired
after the Company Balance Sheet Date (except properties and assets, or interests in properties and assets, sold or otherwise disposed
of since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course), or, with respect to leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in such properties and assets that afford the Company valid leasehold possession of the properties and assets that are
the subject of such leases, in each case, free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens. All machinery, equipment and other
tangible personal property owned or leased by the Company is structurally sound, in good operating condition (normal wear and
tear excepted) and adequate for the uses to which it is put. <U>Section&nbsp;3.6</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
each parcel of Leased Real Property and interest therein (the &ldquo;<U>Company Facilities</U>&rdquo;), the name of the lessor,
licensor, sublessor, master lessor and/or lessee, the commencement date, the term of the Company Lease and each amendment thereto,
the size of the premises and the aggregate annual rental payable thereunder. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct
and complete copies of all Leases and other Contracts in respect of all Leased Real Property, including all exhibits, addenda,
modifications, amendments, renewals, terminations and supplements thereto (&ldquo;<U>Company Leases</U>&rdquo;). The Company currently
occupies all of the Company Facilities for the operation of its business, and there are no other parties occupying, or with a
right to occupy, the Company Facilities. The Company Facilities are in good operating condition and repair and are suitable for
the conduct of the Business. The Company is not violating, and since the Company&rsquo;s formation, has not violated, any Law
relating to any Leased Real Property or operations thereon. The Company has performed all of its obligations under any termination
agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any Lease of real property that is no longer in effect and has no continuing liability
with respect to such terminated real property Leases. The Company is not a party to any agreement or subject to any claim that
may require the payment of any leasing commission, real estate brokerage commission or other brokerage fee, and no such commission
or fee is owed with respect to any of the Company Facilities. The Leased Real Property is not subject to any rights of way, building
use restrictions, title exceptions, variances, reservations or limitations of any kind or nature, except (i)&nbsp;those that in
the aggregate do not impair the current use, occupancy, value or marketability of title to the Leased Real Property, (ii)&nbsp;as
set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;3.6</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii)&nbsp;to the extent expressly set forth in the
Lease relating to such Leased Real Property. All buildings, plants, structures and other improvements used by any Company lie
wholly within the boundaries of the Leased Real Property and do not encroach upon the property, or otherwise conflict with the
property rights, of any other Person. Except as set forth on <U>Section&nbsp;3.6</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Leased
Real Property complies with all applicable Laws, including zoning and land use laws, regulations, codes and/or ordinances, and
the Company has not received any notifications from any Governmental Authority or insurance company recommending improvements
to the Leased Real Property or any other actions relative to the Leased Real Property. The Company has not entered into (or been
granted) any extension, amendment, waiver or other accommodation in connection with the economic conditions relating to COVID-19
that would have the result of decreasing, delaying or otherwise modifying its payment obligations with respect to the Company
Leases or Company Facilities.</P>

of Law or Government Contract. No Governmental Authority, prime contractor, or subcontractor has notified the Company of a Company
breach or violation of applicable Law with respect to any Government Contract. All certifications, representations and disclosure
statements submitted by the Company with respect to any Government Contract were accurate and complete in all material respects
as of the date of submission and were properly updated in all material respects to the extent required by applicable Law and the
applicable Government Contract. Neither the Company nor any of its Principals (as defined in FAR 2.101 for purposes of this Section)
are debarred or suspended in any form from doing business with any Governmental Authority nor have any of them otherwise been
declared ineligible to do business with any Governmental Authority. There are no circumstances that would be reasonably expected
to warrant the institution of proceedings for debarment, suspension or ineligibility against the Company or any of its Principals.
Neither the Company nor any of its Principals is under investigation, charge or indictment with respect to any alleged irregularity,
violation, misstatement or omission arising under or in any way relating to any Government Contract. No termination for convenience,
termination for default, show cause notice, or cure notice has been issued against the Company with respect to a Government Contract.
To the Company&rsquo;s Knowledge, no event has occurred that could result in a material breach or a Government Contract or permit
a termination for cause. There are no irregularities, violations, misstatements, omissions, or other facts or circumstances relating
to any Government Contract that have led to, or would have a reasonable likelihood of leading to, (i)&nbsp;an administrative,
civil or criminal complaint, investigation or indictment of the Company or any of its Principals, (ii)&nbsp;the recoupment of
any payments or reimbursements made to the Company or (iii)&nbsp;the assessment of any material penalties or damages of any kind.
There are no pending audits, cost reviews, compliance reviews, or related investigations by a Governmental Authority of the Company
arising under or relating to any Government Contract. There have been no such audits, review, or investigations that have or would
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse finding with respect to a Government Contract.</P>

such individual&rsquo;s compensation, how said compensation is calculated (e.g., hourly rate, flat fee,&nbsp;etc.), a brief description
of the nature of the services provided, the initial date of such individual&rsquo;s engagement, the anticipated end date of such
individual&rsquo;s engagement (if any), the term of the engagement and prior notice entitlement and whether notice has been provided
to terminate such engagement by either party thereto. All Company Contractors have been properly classified as independent contractors
and all such Person&rsquo;s agreements contain provisions which state that no employer-employee relationship exists between such
Persons and the Company. To the Company&rsquo;s Knowledge, no current Company Contractor has any plans to cease such engagement
(whether as a result of the Transactions or otherwise). The Company does not have and has never had any Liabilities with respect
to any misclassification of any Person (including any Company Contractor) as an independent contractor, and the Company has complied
with all applicable Laws related to such classification. The Company does not engage any personnel through third-party agencies.
No Company Contractor has a basis for a claim or any other allegation that such Person was not properly classified as an independent
contractor. No Company Contractor is a party to or bound by any Contract that (i)&nbsp;could adversely affect the performance
of his or her services as a Company Contractor other than for the benefit of the Company, (ii)&nbsp;could adversely affect the
ability of the Company to conduct its Business, (iii)&nbsp;restricts or limits in any way the scope or type of work in which he
or she may be engaged other than for the benefit of the Company or (iv)&nbsp;requires him or her to transfer, assign or disclose
any confidential information or Intellectual Property to anyone other than the Company. Each Company Contractor satisfies (or
satisfied) the requirements of applicable Law to be classified as an independent contractor, including wage Laws and Laws applicable
to employee benefits, and no Company Contractor is (or was) entitled to be classified as an employee of the Company. No Company
Contractor has made any claim, whether verbally or in writing, to the Company that he or she is (or was) or should be (or should
have been) classified as an employee of the Company.</P>

the Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions,

to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative, the Representative will reimburse
the Sellers pro rata according to each such Person&rsquo;s respective Seller&rsquo;s Percentage Interest of the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly
to the Representative by the Sellers, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Representative from (i)&nbsp;first,
the Expense Fund and (ii)&nbsp;second, any other funds that become payable to the Sellers under this Agreement at such time as
such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Sellers; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that while this Section&nbsp;allows
the Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources, this does not relieve the Sellers from their obligation to promptly
pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Sellers or otherwise. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation
or removal of the Representative or the termination of this Agreement.</P>

not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or
