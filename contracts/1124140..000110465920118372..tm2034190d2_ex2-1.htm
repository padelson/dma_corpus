shares of such holder's Company Capital Stock with respect to which such

series of Company Capital Stock held by such holder and its Affiliates, if
applicable. Any shares of Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting Shares
and Excluded Shares) with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not
received an effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00
p.m., Eastern Time, on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following
the date of Information Statement (the " _Election Deadline_ ") (other than
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed to be " _No Election
Shares_ ," and the holders of such No Election Shares shall be deemed to have
made a Mixed Election with respect to such No Election Shares with the
number of Mixed Election Stock Election Shares and Mixed Election Cash
Election Shares thereunder set by the Exchange Agent as provided herein.
Parent and the Company shall notify each holder of the anticipated Election
Deadline at least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the
rescheduled Election Deadline. As soon after the First Effective Time as
reasonably practicable, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the
following prorations to the Merger Consideration:

  



  

(A) If the Total Upfront Cash Election Consideration is greater
than the Available Cash Election Amount, then each Cash Election Share and
each Mixed Election Cash Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (x) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Cash
Election Prorated Cash Amount, and (y) a certificate or book entry reflecting
an amount of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Per Share Cash
Election Prorated Stock Amount. For any Company Stockholder who holds more
than one class or series of Company Capital Stock if no election is specified
with respect to the priority of such proration, the proration will be applied
first to shares of Series B Preferred Stock, then shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, then shares of Junior A-1 Preferred Stock, then shares of Junior A
Preferred Stock, and lastly to shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(B) If the Total Upfront Stock Election Consideration is greater
than the Stock Consideration Shares, then each Stock Election Share and each
Mixed Election Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to
receive (x) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to Per Share Excess
Stock Election Cash Amount and (y) a certificate or book entry reflecting an
amount of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to Per Share Excess Stock
Election Stock Amount. For any Company Stockholder who holds more than
one class or series of Company Capital Stock if no election is specified with
respect to the priority of such proration, the proration will be applied
first to shares of Series A Preferred Stock, then shares of Junior A-1
Preferred Stock, then shares of Junior A Preferred Stock, then shares of
Company Common Stock and then shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

  



  

(iii) Any election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form
by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the
authorized Person properly submitting such Election Form, by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an
Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of
Company Capital Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of such shares of Company Capital Stock prior to
the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form.

Share Upfront Cash Consideration, _plus_ (ii) the quotient of (x) the Per
Share Upfront Stock Consideration divided by (y) the Parent Stock Price

applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable
Law to be withheld as determined by Parent. Each Adjusted Option shall
continue to have and be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions

Effective Time, except that (i) the vesting schedule of each Adjusted
Option shall be converted to annual installments for the remainder of the
vesting schedule of such Adjusted Option (after giving effect to any
acceleration set forth in _Section 2.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule);
(ii) each Adjusted Option shall be exercisable for that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (B) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio; and (iii) the per share exercise price for each
share of Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of the Adjusted Option shall be
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by
dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time by (B) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable under each
Adjusted Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any
Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price
and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable under such
Adjusted Option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing in a
manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.

and

  



  

(iv) with respect to each Adjusted Option that is unvested
immediately following the Closing, the payments set forth above in clauses (i)
through (iii) shall be contingent on the vesting of such Adjusted Option,
such that the portion of such payments received by the holder thereof shall
equal the portion of the Adjusted Option in which such holder becomes vested.

  



  

(e) The Company shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing, take or cause to be taken all actions
(including adopting corporate resolutions, providing any notices and
procuring any consents, in all cases satisfactory to Parent) that
are required under any Company Option or the Company Equity Plan, or are
otherwise necessary or appropriate, to cause the Company Options to be
treated in accordance with this _Section 2.6(c)(ii)_.

2.14 _Non-Conversion_.

  



  

(a) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into

such Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.

provisions of _Section 2.14(a)_, if any Company Stockholder effectively
waives, withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect, waiver or otherwise)
such Company Stockholder's appraisal or dissenters' rights with respect to
any Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, then, (i) such Company Stockholder's
shares shall automatically convert into and represent only the right to

instructions thereto (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent), and (ii) confirmation by CARTA, pursuant to
the CARTA Letter, of the cancellation of the Company Capital Stock
Certificate representing the relevant shares of Company Capital Stock, the
record owner of such Company Capital Stock Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the consideration provided for herein. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make payment to each such Company
Stockholder promptly following receipt by the Exchange Agent of such duly
completed Letter of Transmittal and such information from CARTA. If payment
of any portion of the consideration provided for herein is to be made to any
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Capital Stock
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the applicable portion of the consideration
provided for herein to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Company Capital Stock Certificate or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. After the First Effective Time, each Company Capital Stock
Certificate shall represent only the right to receive the applicable portion
of the consideration provided for herein as contemplated by this _Article
II_.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Capital Stock_. The right to receive the applicable portion of the
consideration provided for herein, in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock previously
represented by such Company Capital Stock Certificates, and at the close of

First Effective Time, Company Capital Stock Certificates are presented to
Parent or the Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time after six (6)
months following the First Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to

Stock Certificates held by such holders.

  



  

2.16 _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, none of the parties hereto or the Exchange Agent shall be liable

to the contrary, Parent, the Company, the Merger Subs, the First-Step
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent (each a "

portion of any payments contemplated by this _Article II_ or any other
amount payable to a Seller pursuant to this Agreement, and shall pay to the
appropriate taxing Authority, such amounts that are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payments under any Tax Law.
To the extent amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate taxing authority in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Seller in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made. Without
limiting the foregoing, and in lieu of deducting from any payment, the
applicable Withholding Agent may require that any Seller make
arrangements satisfactory to such applicable Withholding Agent to satisfy any
withholding requirements as a condition to making any payment (including, for
example, in an instance where payment is to be made in shares of Parent Common
Stock); _provided_ , that any Seller may request that such applicable
Withholding Agent accept commercially reasonable arrangements (including sell
to cover arrangements) with respect to satisfying such withholding
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any
compensatory payments for Tax purposes payable pursuant to or as contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid through the payroll system of Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent subject to applicable Tax withholding. For the avoidance
of doubt, any such amount withheld shall reduce the cash consideration
payable to such Seller regardless of whether the withholding is in respect of
cash or equity consideration payable hereunder.

  



  

2.18 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
II_ to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
_Section 5.1_, if between the date of this Agreement and the First Effective

series by reason of the occurrence or record date of any Stock Event, the per

_Section 2.6(c)(ii)_ and _Section 2.8_) shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such Stock Event.

  



  

2.19 _Effect of the Second Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Second

Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any shares of Company
Capital Stock for which a properly completed Letter of Transmittal has not
been received by the Exchange Agent, Parent shall be entitled to withhold the
payment in respect thereof until receipt by the Exchange Agent of a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal. Parent shall pay interest on any payments
that are not paid on or before the date such payments are due under this
_Section 2.20(a)_ at an annual rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per

(b) _No Guarantee of Achievement of Milestones_. Subject to
_Section 2.20(c)_, the parties agree, and each of the Sellers, by his, her
or its execution of a Stockholder Written Consent, a Key Stockholder Support
Agreement, a Letter of Transmittal and/or receipt of consideration for the
Mergers hereunder, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) nothing herein shall
constitute a guarantee by Parent or the Surviving Entity of the achievement
of any Milestone or all of the Milestones; and (ii) (A) Parent shall have the
sole decision-making authority over the development of all technologies,
clinical trials, products and other business conducted to achieve any
Milestone or develop any FDA Approved Test, (B) Parent is entitled to conduct

make decisions with respect to the conduct of the business of the Surviving
Entity with respect to the development of any FDA Approved Test or the
achievement of any Milestone and to take or refrain from taking any action

of any Milestone, and (C) Parent or an Affiliate of Parent currently or may
in the future offer or develop products or services that compete, either
directly or indirectly, with any FDA Approved Test and may make decisions
with respect to such products and services that may adversely affect the
development of an FDA Approved Test or the achievement of a Milestone.

  



  

(c) _Achievement of Milestones_. Notwithstanding _Section
2.20(b)_, from and after the Closing Date until the expiration of the
Milestone Efforts Period, Parent shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Surviving Entity) to use,
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to achieve (or cause its Affiliates,
licensees, sublicensees, distributors or resellers to achieve) each of the
Milestones. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will not
take any action with respect to the conduct of the business of the Surviving
Entity post-Closing with the primary intent to prevent the achievement of a
Milestone.

achieved, during the Milestone Efforts Period, within fifteen (15)
Business Days after Parent files its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Parent shall

will use commercially reasonable efforts to make itself available to answer
follow-up questions between annual meeting updates on an ad hoc basis, subject
to the meetings occurring during normal business hours and being reasonable
in scope, frequency and duration (in Parent's discretion).

(e) _Milestone Disputes_. In the event that the Representative
believes in good faith that a Milestone has been achieved, it shall
notify Parent in writing of such belief and provide Parent with a
corresponding Milestone Spreadsheet and evidence of justification that such
Milestone has been achieved. To the extent Parent agrees, Parent shall make
(or cause to be made) to the Sellers the corresponding Milestone
Consideration within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice and
Milestone Spreadsheet in accordance with _Section 2.20(a)_, subject to the
late payment interest set forth therein, if any. To the extent Parent
disagrees and disputes such achievement, the parties shall discuss and
attempt to resolve such dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such
dispute within sixty (60) days of notification by Representative of its
belief, the parties shall submit for arbitration all matters that remain in
dispute to a disinterested individual who has appropriate scientific,
technical and regulatory expertise (as relevant) to resolve any disputes
referred to him or her under this _Section 2.20(e)_ (a " _Dispute Expert_ ")
who is mutually agreed to by Seller and the Representative; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Dispute Expert shall not be or have been at any time
within the previous five (5) years an Affiliate, employee, consultant,
officer or director of Parent, the Representative, the Surviving Entity, any
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates. If Parent and the
Representative cannot agree on a mutually acceptable Dispute Expert within
thirty (30) days after either party has determined that the parties cannot
reach agreement with respect to a dispute, then within ten (10) Business Days
after the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, each of Parent and the
Representative shall appoint one Dispute Expert who shall jointly select a
third Dispute Expert within ten (10) Business Days after the last to occur of
their respective appointments to arbitrate the referred matter. The Dispute
Expert mutually agreed by the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, the
third Dispute Expert selected by the party-appointed Dispute Experts is
referred to as the " _Selected Dispute Expert_ ". Parent and the
Representative shall instruct the Selected Dispute Expert to determine as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
such person's appointment (the " _Determination Period_ ") whether
the disputed Milestone has occurred. The Selected Dispute Expert's
determination shall be made based on the submission of documents and evidence
by the parties (including any such documentation or evidence reasonably
requested by the Selected Dispute Expert, which the Representative or Parent
shall provide upon written request) and, upon the Selected Dispute Expert's
request, by third parties, unless the Selected Dispute Expert determines that
an oral hearing is necessary. The Selected Dispute Expert shall determine
deadlines (which Parent and the Representative shall deem to be fair and
appropriate) within the Determination Period for submitting documents and
dates, if any, of oral hearings. Each of Parent and the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall pay its own expenses of arbitration, and the
fees, costs and expenses of the Selected Dispute Expert shall be equally
shared between Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). Any
decision rendered by the Selected Dispute Expert shall be made in writing and
be final and binding upon the parties. All proceedings conducted by the
Selected Dispute Expert shall take place in Boston, Massachusetts. Any
underpayments of Milestone Consideration shall be paid by Seller for further
distribution per terms of the Agreement within five (5) Business Days of
notification of the final determination of the Milestone Dispute Notice in
accordance with this _Section 2.20(e)_.

  



  

(f) _Efforts Standard_. The parties intend the definition of
"Commercially Reasonable Efforts" where such term is expressly applicable to
govern their contractual relationship and to supersede any standard of efforts
that might otherwise be imposed by applicable Law.

  



  

(g) _Divestitures_. If at any time after the Closing until the
expiration of the Milestone Efforts Period, Parent or the Surviving Entity
effects a Divestiture to a third party, or such third party effects a further
Divestiture (any such third party or further transferee, the " _Transferee_

required by applicable Law and the applicable Government Contract. Neither
the Company nor any of its Principals (as defined in FAR 2.101 for purposes of
this Section) are debarred or suspended in any form from doing business with
any Governmental Authority nor have any of them otherwise been declared
ineligible to do business with any Governmental Authority. There are no
circumstances that would be reasonably expected to warrant the institution of
proceedings for debarment, suspension or ineligibility against the Company or
any of its Principals. Neither the Company nor any of its Principals is under

criminal complaint, investigation or indictment of the Company or any of its
Principals, (ii) the recoupment of any payments or reimbursements made to the
Company or (iii) the assessment of any material penalties or damages of any
kind. There are no pending audits, cost reviews, compliance reviews, or
related investigations by a Governmental Authority of the Company arising
under or relating to any Government Contract. There have been no such audits,
review, or investigations that have or would reasonably be expected to result
in a material adverse finding with respect to a Government Contract.

  



   | 3.17| _Employee Benefits and Employment Matters_.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Section 3.17(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains
a list of all current Company Employees as of the date hereof, and correctly
reflects: (i) their names and dates of hire, (ii) their job title, full-time
or part-time status, including each Company Employee's classification as
either exempt or non-exempt from the overtime requirements under any
applicable Law, (iii) their annual base salary, hourly wage rate, or piece
rate, as applicable, (iv) any other compensation payable to them including
compensation payable pursuant to bonus (for the current fiscal year and the
most recently completed fiscal year), deferred compensation or commission
arrangements, overtime payment, car maintenance or car entitlements,
entitlement to pension arrangement and/or any other provident fund (including
manager's insurance and education fund), their respective contribution rates
and the salary basis for such contributions, (v) sick and vacation leave or
paid time off that is accrued and unused and (vi) any promises or commitments
made to any of the Company Employees, whether in writing or not, with respect
to any future changes or additions to their compensation or benefits listed
in _Section 3.17(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Details of

(b) _Section 3.17(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains
a list of all the Significant Company Contractors as of the date hereof and,
for each, such individual's compensation, how said compensation is calculated
(e.g., hourly rate, flat fee, etc.), a brief description of the nature of the
services provided, the initial date of such individual's engagement, the
anticipated end date of such individual's engagement (if any), the term of
the engagement and prior notice entitlement and whether notice has been
provided to terminate such engagement by either party thereto. All Company
Contractors have been properly classified as independent contractors and all
such Person's agreements contain provisions which state that no employer-
employee relationship exists between such Persons and the Company. To the
Company's Knowledge, no current Company Contractor has any plans to cease such
engagement (whether as a result of the Transactions or otherwise). The
Company does not have and has never had any Liabilities with respect to any
misclassification of any Person (including any Company Contractor) as an
independent contractor, and the Company has complied with all applicable Laws
related to such classification. The Company does not engage any personnel
through third-party agencies. No Company Contractor has a basis for a claim
or any other allegation that such Person was not properly classified as an
independent contractor. No Company Contractor is a party to or bound by any
Contract that (i) could adversely affect the performance of his or her
services as a Company Contractor other than for the benefit of the Company,
(ii) could adversely affect the ability of the Company to conduct its
Business, (iii) restricts or limits in any way the scope or type of work in
which he or she may be engaged other than for the benefit of the Company or
(iv) requires him or her to transfer, assign or disclose any confidential
information or Intellectual Property to anyone other than the Company. Each
Company Contractor satisfies (or satisfied) the requirements of applicable
Law to be classified as an independent contractor, including wage Laws and
Laws applicable to employee benefits, and no Company Contractor is (or was)
entitled to be classified as an employee of the Company. No
Company Contractor has made any claim, whether verbally or in writing, to the
Company that he or she is (or was) or should be (or should have been)
classified as an employee of the Company.

  



  

(c) _Section 3.17(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists

(e) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as
required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended (" _COBRA_ ") or similar state Law, and the Company has complied all
material respects with the requirements of COBRA. There has been no
"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and
regulatory guidance thereunder) with respect to any Company Employee Plan.
Each Company Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed
by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the
Code). All material contributions required to be made by the Company or
any Subsidiary to any Company Employee Plan, including employee elective
deferrals or salary reduction contributions, have been made on or before
their due dates and a reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to
each Company Employee Plan for the current plan years (and no further
contributions will be due or will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing
Date, other than contributions accrued in the Ordinary Course after the
Company Balance Sheet Date as a result of the operations of the Company after
the Company Balance Sheet Date). No Company Employee Plan is covered by, and
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur
any Liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. With respect
to each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA as either an employee pension
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA or an employee
welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has prepared in good faith and timely filed all
requisite governmental reports (which were true, correct and complete as of
the date filed), including any required audit reports, and has properly and
timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees
required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company
Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action, litigation or
claim has been brought, or to the Company's Knowledge, is threatened, against
or with respect to any such Company Employee Plan, the assets of any of the
trusts under such Company Employee Plans, the plan sponsor or the plan
administrator or any fiduciary of any Company Employee Plans, including any
audit or inquiry by the IRS or U.S. Department of Labor.

  



  

(f) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Company Employee Plan that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent full fiscal
year included in the Financial Statements.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any current or former ERISA Affiliate
currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, or has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to, any
pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under, any

defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA or any voluntary employees' beneficiary
association that is intended to be tax exempt under Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.

(i) Each Company Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section
401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or
the Company is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion or advisory letter
issued by the IRS with respect to the qualified status of the plan document
and, to the Company's Knowledge, nothing has occurred with respect to the
operation or maintenance of such Company Employee Plan that would reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

  



  

(j) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been, nor is
reasonably expected to be, subject to an employer shared responsibility
payment under Section 4980H of the Code or incurred or reasonably expects to
incur, either directly or indirectly, any other material Tax or penalty under

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

4.6 _Information Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent for

there are no presently existing facts or circumstances that would constitute
any reasonable basis for any such Legal Proceeding or Order.

4.9 _Due Diligence Review_. Parent represents and warrants that it
is acquiring the Company Capital Stock solely for its own account for
investment and not with a view to or for sale or distribution of said units or
any part thereof in violation of any applicable securities Laws. Parent
understands that the Company Capital Stock have not been registered under the
Securities Act. Parent realizes that the basis for the exemption may not be
present if, notwithstanding its representations, Parent has a present
intention of acquiring the securities for a fixed or determinable period in
the future, selling (in connection with a distribution or
otherwise), granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the
securities. Parent has no such present intention. Parent is an
Accredited Investor. Parent acknowledges and agrees that it has made its own
inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent
judgment concerning the Company and has been furnished with or given adequate
access to such information about the Company as it has requested. Parent
represents and warrants that is has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters that Parent is capable of evaluating the rights and
merits of the purchase of the Company Capital Stock.

shall: (a) grant such approvals and take all actions necessary so that no 
"business combination", "control share acquisition", "fair price",
"moratorium" or other anti-takeover or similar Laws become applicable to this
Agreement, the Support Agreements and the Key Stockholder Support Agreement
or the Transactions, including the Mergers, and (b) if any such anti-takeover
or similar Law becomes applicable to the Transactions, grant such approvals
and take all actions necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Parties will reasonably cooperate with each other and use (and will cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior
to the Outside Date and to cause the conditions to the Mergers set forth in
_Article VI_ to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to
the Outside Date, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following as promptly as reasonably practicable prior to the Outside Date:
(i) the obtaining of all actions or non-actions, consents,
approvals, registrations, waivers, permits, authorizations, orders,

any Governmental Authority or other Person that are or may become necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with the consummation of the Transactions

Approvals_ "); (ii) the preparation and making of all registrations, filings,
forms, notices, petitions, statements, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including filings with Governmental
Authorities) that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, including the
Mergers; and (iii) the taking of all steps as may be necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain an approval from, or to avoid a Legal Proceeding by, any
Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with the consummation of
the Transactions, including the Mergers. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent, approval or waiver with respect to
Material Contracts in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
from third Persons to the extent reasonably requested by Parent after
consulting with the Company in good faith regarding the request. Each of the
Parties shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other Parties and as
promptly as reasonably practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, make its respective filings under the
HSR Act, and make any other applications and filings as reasonably determined
by the Company and Parent under other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect
to the Transactions, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than as
required by Law. Parent shall pay all filing fees and other charges for the
filings required under any Antitrust Law by the Company or Parent with respect
to the Transactions (the " _Regulatory Filing Fees_ ").

  



  

(b) In connection with (and without limiting the efforts
referenced in _Section 5.6(a)_), each of the Parties will (i) furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any governmental filings,
submissions or other documents; (ii) give the other reasonable prior notice of
any such filing, submission or other document and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with or from any Governmental
Authority regarding the Transactions, and permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views, and secure the
participation, of the other in connection with any such filing, submission,
document or communication; and (iii) cooperate in responding as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any investigation or other inquiry from a
Governmental Authority or in connection with any Legal Proceeding initiated
by a Governmental Authority or private party, including informing the other
Parties as soon as practicable of any such investigation, inquiry or Legal
Proceeding, and consulting in advance, to the extent practicable, before
making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or, in
connection with any Legal Proceeding initiated by a private party, to any
other Person. In addition, each of the Parties will give reasonable prior
notice to and consult with the other in advance of any meeting, conference or
substantive communication with any Governmental Authority, or, in
connection with any Legal Proceeding by a private party, with any other
Person, and to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate or attend any meeting or conference,
or engage in any substantive communication, with any Governmental Authority or
such other Person in respect of the Transactions without the other Party (as
between Parent and the Company), and in the event either Parent or the
Company is prohibited from, or unable to participate, attend or engage in,
any such meeting, conference or communication, keep such Party apprised with
respect thereto. Each Party shall furnish to the other Parties copies of all
filings, submissions, correspondence and communications between it and its
Affiliates and their respective representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental Authority's staff (or
any other Person in connection with any Legal Proceeding initiated by a
private party), on the other hand, with respect to the Transactions. Each
Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate material
provided to the other party as "Outside Counsel Only Material," and also may
reasonably redact the material as necessary to (A) remove personally
sensitive information, (B) remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries conducted in
connection with the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
negotiations and investigations leading thereto, (C) comply with contractual
arrangements, (D) prevent the loss of a legal privilege or (E) comply with

(d) Neither Parent nor either Merger Sub shall, nor shall they
permit their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree
to acquire any rights, interests, assets, business, Person or division
thereof that is developing a blood-based multi-cancer screening test (through
acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or otherwise), if such
acquisition would constitute a material acquisition required to be reported
via Item 2.01 of Form 8-K.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and
for the avoidance of doubt, the Representative shall not have any obligations
under this _Section 5.6_.

  



  

5.7 _Notice of Developments_. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 5.1_, except to the extent (i) expressly permitted by the terms of
this Agreement; (ii) required by applicable Law or (iii) expressly set forth
in _Section 5.1 _of the Company Disclosure Schedule, during the period from
the date hereof and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Closing, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent in writing, following gaining knowledge, of:

commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
that relate to the consummation of any of the Mergers, this Agreement or the
Information Statement (each, a " _New Litigation Claim_ ") and (ii) ongoing
material developments in any New Litigation Claim; and

  



  

(d) any event, condition, fact, circumstance, occurrence or event
that, individually or in the aggregate with any other events,
conditions, facts, circumstances, occurrences or events, would reasonably be
expected to be materially adverse to the Company or cause any of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ not to be satisfied.

  



  

(e) No information obtained by Parent or the Merger Subs pursuant
to this _Section 5.7_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, obligation or condition set
forth herein, and all such information shall be disregarded for the purpose
of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ have been
satisfied and shall not be deemed to qualify any of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Article III_ in any respect. The Company shall
consult Parent in good faith regarding the conduct of the defense of any New
Litigation Claim.

  



  

5.8 _Access_. During the period from the date hereof and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII _and the Closing, to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Law, (i) the Company shall afford Parent and its Affiliates and
representatives reasonable access during business hours and upon prior notice
to (A) the Company Group's properties, personnel, books, Contracts and
records and (B) all other information in the Company Group's possession
concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company Group as
Parent may reasonably request and (ii) the Company shall provide to Parent
and its representatives true, correct and complete copies of the Company's
internal financial statements and all related workpapers and other supporting

requested by Parent with one or more representatives of Parent to discuss any
material changes or developments in the operational matters of the Company
and the Business and the general status of the ongoing operations of the
Company and the Business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
such investigation or examination shall be permitted to the extent that (a)
it would require the Company to disclose information (i) subject to attorney-
client privilege, (ii) which would conflict with any confidentiality
obligations to which the Company is bound or (iii) in violation of applicable
Law, or (b) such access would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
Business. Further, the Company must approve, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, and an officer of the Company
must be present and included in any communications with, any Company
Employee.

release, unless otherwise required by (a) applicable Law, (b) stock exchange

5.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Surviving Entity shall
assume sponsorship of the Company Employee Plans set forth in _Exhibit

Closing, the Company shall deliver evidence, reasonable satisfactory to
Parent, that it has taken all actions necessary to transfer sponsorship of the
Transferred Plans to the Surviving Entity, including adopting any necessary
amendments to such Transferred Plans. To the extent requested by Parent, the

policies, administrative or investment services agreements or similar
agreements pertaining to any of the Transferred Plans.

 | 82| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the first anniversary thereof with respect to each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who remains employed by Parent, the Surviving
Entity and/or their respective Subsidiaries immediately after the First
Effective Time (each, a " _Covered Employee_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Entity and/or the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, to (i) for each such Covered Employee,
provide cash compensation, including base salary or hourly wages and annual
cash incentive opportunities (excluding any equity or equity-
based compensation), at levels that are no less than those in effect
immediately prior to the First Effective Time and (ii) for such Covered
Employees, provide retirement, health and welfare benefits at levels which
are, in the aggregate (together with any additional cash or other
compensation of benefits provided by Parent), either (A) substantially similar
in the aggregate to those in effect for the Covered Employees immediately
prior to the First Effective Time or (B) substantially similar in the
aggregate to those in effect for similarly situated employees of Parent.
Parent will treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the
service of the Covered Employees with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company attributable to any period before the First Effective Time as service
rendered to Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the vacation program, health or welfare plan(s) maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, and Parent's defined contribution plans, except where credit
would result in duplication of benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, to
the extent that any Covered Employee participates in any health or other
group welfare benefit plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent following
the First Effective Time, (A) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting
periods or required physical examinations under any health or similar welfare
plan of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to be waived with respect to the
Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under
the corresponding plan in which the Covered Employee participated immediately
prior to the First Effective Time, and (B) Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any deductibles paid by the Covered Employee under
any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' health plans in the plan year in
which the First Effective Time occurs to be credited towards
deductibles under the health plans of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent.

  



  

(e) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this _Section 5.10_ with respect to employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other Person, including
employees, former employees, any participant or any beneficiary thereof, in
any Company Employee Plan, or (ii) to continued employment with the Company,
Parent, the First-Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 5.10_ to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company
Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plans of the Company, Parent, the
First-Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or shall prohibit Parent, the First-Step
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit
plan.

  



  

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the
Transactions will constitute a Change in Control as well as a Sale Event (as
such terms are defined in the Company's severance policies and equity plans as
of the date hereof and disclosed to Parent in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for purposes of
all employment, severance and similar agreements (to the extent disclosed to
Parent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) between the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries and any Person who was employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately preceding the First Effective Time, including those
on vacation or a leave of absence. From and after the First Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity and/or the appropriate
Subsidiaries of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, to assume
and honor all terms of all cash bonus plans, equity award plans, employment
agreements, consulting agreements, change-of-control agreements and severance
agreements, severance plans and other plans between the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any officer, director, employee or consultant of the Company
or Subsidiary in effect prior to the First Effective Time, to the extent
disclosed to Parent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Further,
from the First Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the First
Effective Time, Parent shall not, or shall cause the Surviving Entity and/or
the appropriate Subsidiaries of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, to not amend, revise, change or end any severance policy disclosed
to Parent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and providing for
compensation and benefits to Covered Employees during the two-year period
following the First Effective Time. To the extent requested by Parent at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and
shall cause all of its Subsidiaries to, assign, to Parent or a designee of
Parent, all restrictive covenant, nondisclosure, confidentiality, invention,
intellectual property and similar agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any employee, contractor, or consultant to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

5.11 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns of the
Company Group that are first due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) after the Closing Date and that relate in whole or in part to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (each, a " _Parent Prepared Return_ "), and Parent
shall timely remit or cause to be timely remitted any Taxes due in respect of
such Parent Prepared Returns. To the extent any Parent Prepared
Return relates in whole or part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, each such Parent
Prepared Return shall (i) be prepared in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Company Group unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
(ii) include all Transaction Deductions on the income Tax Return of the
Company for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, and (iii) be prepared in a manner consistent
with the Intended Tax-Free Treatment, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. In the event that any item reflected on any Parent Prepared Return could
increase the amount of Taxes included in Closing Net Cash or Company
Transaction Expenses or result in an Offset Right for such Taxes by the Parent
Indemnified Persons under _Section 7.1_, Parent will submit such Parent
Prepared Return to the Representative for review and comment at least thirty
(30) days prior to the due date for filing such Parent Prepared Return (or, if
such due date is within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, as
promptly as practicable following the Closing Date), and will not file any
such Parent Prepared Return without the consent of the Representative, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(b) For all purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any
Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes of the Company Group that are
allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two (2) taxable years or periods, one of which ended at the
close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date, and (i) Taxes based on, or computed with
respect to, net income or earnings, gross income or earnings, payroll,
capital or net worth, or any other Taxes resulting from or imposed on, sales,
receipts, uses, transfers or assignments of property or other assets, payments
or accruals to other Persons (including wages) or any other similar
transaction or transactions of any member of the Company Group for the
Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
Company or such Subsidiary were closed at the close of the Closing Date and
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes, such Taxes shall be equal to the product
of the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
Straddle Period before and including the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the total number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.

  



  

(c) Without the prior written consent of the Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Parent will
not: (i) except for Tax Returns that are filed in accordance with _Section
5.11(a)_, file or amend, or permit the Company, the Surviving Entity or any
of their Affiliates to file or amend any Tax Return of the Company Group
relating to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; (ii) with respect to Tax Returns filed pursuant to _Section
5.11(a)_, after the date such Tax Returns are filed pursuant to _Section
5.11(a)_, amend or permit the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of their
Affiliates to amend any such Tax Return; (iii) extend or waive, or cause to
be extended or waived, or permit the Company, the Surviving Entity or any of
their Affiliates to extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other
period for the assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) of any member of the Company Group ending on or prior to
the Closing Date; (iv) make or change any election or change any method of
accounting with respect to Taxes with retroactive effect to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date for any member of
the Company Group; (v) initiate discussions or examinations with any Taxing
Authority (including any voluntary disclosures) regarding Pre-Closing Taxes;
or (vi) except as explicitly contemplated by this Agreement, engage in any
transaction on the Closing Date after the Closing outside the Ordinary Course
and consistent with the Company's past practice.

  



  

   

 | 84| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Parent will give prompt written notice to the Representative
of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any Legal
Proceeding, with respect to: (x) any Tax Return of any member of the Company
Group that relates solely to one or more taxable periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date; or (y) any Tax liability of any member of the Company
Group for which the Sellers are partially or wholly responsible under this
Agreement (each, a " _Tax Claim_ ").

  



  

(e) Any transfer, stamp, documentary, sales, use, registration,
value-added and other similar Taxes (including all applicable real
estate transfer Taxes and real property transfer Taxes and including any
filing and recording fees, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, any capital
gain Taxes) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by Parent. Parent and the Company (prior to
the Closing) or the Representative (after the Closing) shall cooperate with
each other in the provision of any information or preparation of any
documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any available
mitigation, reduction or exemption from any Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(f) For all applicable Tax purposes, the Parties agree to, and no
party shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with,
the following Tax treatment of the items specified below:

  



  

(g) The Expense Fund Amount shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Sellers on the Closing Date, and no
Tax withholding or reporting shall be required in connection with the
distribution of any portion of the Expense Fund to the Sellers.

  



  

(h) Any payments made in respect of Company Options pursuant to
this Agreement (A) shall be treated as compensation paid by the Company as
and when received by the holder thereof to whom such payment is due (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall be the Closing Date with respect to the
Expense Fund Amount), (B) shall be net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to
_Section 2.6(c)(ii)_, and (C) shall, in respect of payments attributable to
Company Options held by current or former Company Employees only, be made
through the Surviving Entity's (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto)
standard payroll procedures in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)(ii)_
(provided, however, that payments of the release of the Expense Fund Amount in
respect of Company Options shall be made directly by the Surviving Entity (or
any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto) and not through its payroll). Any
applicable withholding Taxes in respect of the portion of the Expense Fund
Amount borne by Company Optionholders in respect of Company Options shall be
withheld from the cash payable to them pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)(ii)_.

  



  

(i) Any distribution made by the Company with respect to any
shares of Company Capital Stock prior to Closing shall be treated as a
distribution with respect to the Company Capital Stock taxable in accordance
with Code Sections 301 and 316, and not as part of the consideration paid by
Parent to Sellers under Code Section 356.

5.12 _Officers and Directors Insurance and Indemnification_.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain a prepaid extended
reporting period or tail policy insuring the current and former officers or
directors of the Company (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") under the
current program of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company which shall be effective commencing with the Closing Date and
ending six (6) years thereafter and which shall afford coverage for actual or
alleged acts or omissions occurring at, during or prior to the Closing Date
including with respect to the Transactions (including the Mergers) (the " _D
andO Tail Insurance_"). The Company and Parent shall each bear fifty
percent (50%) of the cost of such insurance coverage and the Company's share
of such cost, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing, shall be included
in the determination of the Company Transaction Expenses. Parent will cause
the Surviving Entity to enforce the DandO Tail Insurance upon request of the
DandO Indemnified Persons and will not allow the Surviving Entity to cancel
the DandO Tail Insurance during its term. In addition, for a period of six (6)
years following the Closing Date, Parent, the First-Step Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Entity agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each DandO Indemnified Person as provided in the organizational documents of
the Company or written agreement providing for indemnification of such
individual and made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement,
in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any
other contract, agreement or other arrangement in effect on the date hereof,
shall be assumed by the First-Step Surviving Corporation in the First
Merger and by the Surviving Entity in the Second Merger, without further
action, and shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms other than in connection with any amendment, replacement or modification
that would not materially and adversely affect the rights of the DandO
Indemnified Persons thereunder or an amendment, replacement or modification
which is required by applicable Law, and, in the event that any proceeding is
pending or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final
disposition of such proceeding or claim.

  



  

The provisions of this _Section 5.12 _shall be enforceable by each DandO
Indemnified Person and the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity or its successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any DandO Indemnified Person (or his or
her heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns) in any legal
action brought by such Person that is successful to enforce the obligations
of Parent or the Surviving Entity or its successors under this _Section
5.12_. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity and its successors
under this _Section 5.12_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise
modified in such a manner as to materially and adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Person (or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors
or assigns) without the prior written consent of such DandO Indemnified
Person (or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns,
as applicable).

  



  

5.13 _Listing_. Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to
Nasdaq a supplemental listing application covering the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in the Mergers, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the Closing, approval for the listing of such Parent Common
Stock, subject to official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate
with Parent with respect to such listing.

  



  

5.14 _Payout Spreadsheet and Related Materials_. The Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent, a draft of the Payout Spreadsheet
not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and a final
version of the foregoing not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. In the event that Parent notifies the Company that there are
reasonably apparent errors in the drafts of the Payout Spreadsheet delivered
not later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent and
the Company shall discuss such errors in good faith and the Company shall
correct such errors prior to delivering final versions of the Payout
Spreadsheet. The Company shall provide to Parent, together with the Payout
Spreadsheet, such supporting documentation, information and calculations as
are reasonably necessary for Parent to verify and determine the calculations,
amounts and other matters set forth in the Payout Spreadsheet. In addition
to, and not in lieu of, the other requirements of this _Section 5.14 _the
Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent and the Exchange Agent a
spreadsheet (or "flat file" or similar document) containing the information
required by the Exchange Agent in order for the Exchange Agent to perform its
duties as exchange agent in respect of the Mergers.

5.15 _Data Room_. Within two (2) Business Days following the
date hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent one or more DVDs or thumb
drives containing true, correct and complete electronic copies of all
documents and information placed in the virtual data room hosted by the
Company's service provider at any time prior to the date hereof, and an index,

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_,
from and after the First Effective Time, Parent, the First-Step Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Entity and each of their respective Affiliates,
officers, directors, partners, managers, equityholders, agents and employees
(collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be entitled to
recover, by offset against any Milestone Payment not yet paid (the " _Offset
Right_ ") the aggregate amount of any Damages resulting from or arising out
of the following:

  



  

(i) any breach by the Company, or any allegation by any third
party that, if true, would be a misrepresentation of, inaccuracy in or
breach, of any Fundamental Representation or in the certificate delivered by
the Company pursuant to _Section 6.2(p)_ (solely to the extent related to
any breach of any Fundamental Representation with respect to the obligations
in _Section 6.2(a)_);

  



  

(ii) any claim for Fraud;

  



  

(iii) any breach by the Company, or any allegation by any third
party that, if true, would be a breach, of any obligation, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement (including any pre-Closing Covenant) or
in the certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.2(p)_
(solely with respect to the obligations in _Section 6.2(b)_);

  



  

(iv) any Company Debt to the extent unpaid as of the Closing and
not included in the Net Closing Cash Adjustment Amount;

  



  

(v) any Company Transaction Expenses to the extent unpaid as of
the Closing and not included in the Net Closing Cash Adjustment Amount;

  



  

(vi) any Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent not taken into account in
the calculation of Company Debt or Company Transaction Expenses;

  



  

(vii) any claims, whether direct, derivative, class or individual,
by (A) any then current or former holder or alleged then-current or former
holder of any Equity Interests of the Company (including any predecessors),
arising out of, resulting from or in connection with (I) the Mergers or this
Agreement, including the allocation of the Merger Consideration, or (II) such
Person's status or alleged status as a holder of Equity Interests of the
Company (including any predecessors) at any time at or prior to the Closing,
whether for breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise, (B) any Person to the
effect that such Person is entitled to any Equity Interests of the Company or
any payment in connection with the Mergers by virtue of such Equity Interests
of the Company, including appraisal rights under any applicable Law
(excluding cash payments to holders of Dissenting Shares not in excess of the
consideration to which they would have been entitled for their shares of
Company Capital Stock had they received a portion of the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.6_ rather than exercising appraisal rights) or
(C) any Person with respect to any Company Equity Plan or any other plan,
policy or Contract providing for compensation to such Person in respect of a
Company Security; and

  



  

   

 | 91| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(viii) any claim by any Seller against any Parent Indemnified
Party relating to the allocation or disbursement of the Merger
Consideration, including the actions of the Representative in connection
therewith (other than as required to be paid by Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement).

  



  

 _provided_ , that the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to
recover up to fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate amount of any Damages
resulting or arising out of _Section 7.1(a)(iii)_ through _Section
7.1(a)(viii)_.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of Damages
the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to offset under _Section
7.1(a)_ shall not exceed the Aggregate Milestone Consideration that becomes
otherwise payable to the Sellers hereunder (the  " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of Fraud committed by
the Company with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or obligation made hereunder, the amount of Damages the Parent Indemnified
Party may recover from the Sellers shall not be limited to the Cap, regardless
of whether any Sellers had knowledge or participated in such Fraud.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) any Seller's liability
for Damages pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)_ shall be on a several and not joint
basis based on (x) in the case of Damages offset from the Aggregate Milestone
Consideration, such Seller's pro rata share of the Aggregate Milestone
Consideration that becomes payable to the Sellers and (y) in the case of
Damages for Fraud committed by the Company, such Seller's pro rata share of
the Merger Consideration actually received by the Sellers, (ii) in no event
shall any Seller have liability for Damages resulting from or arising out of
Fraud committed by another Seller, and (iii) in no event shall any Seller's
liability for Damages pursuant _Section 7.1(a)_ exceed the aggregate Merger
Consideration received by such Seller. For the sake of clarity, in no event
will the Parent Indemnified Parties be entitled to offset any Damages or
clawback Damages against Milestone Payments already paid, in the absence of
Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) no
Sellers shall have any right of indemnification, contribution or right of
advancement from Parent, the Merger Subs, the Company or any other
Parent Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages claimed by any Parent
Indemnified Party and (ii) the Sellers shall not have any right of
subrogation against the Company, Parent or the Merger Subs with respect to the
Offset Right of any Parent Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, the amount of any Damages that may be recovered by any
Parent Indemnified Party shall be calculated net of the amount of any Tax
benefits actually realized by such Parent Indemnified Party in respect of
such Damages or any of the events or circumstances giving rise to or otherwise
related to such Damages. The representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company, and the Parent Indemnified Parties' right to indemnification with
respect thereto, shall not be affected, deemed waived or otherwise limited by
reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified
Party or by reason of the fact that any Parent Indemnified Party knew or
should have known that any such representation or warranty is, was or might be
inaccurate or by reason of any Parent Indemnified Party's waiver of any
condition set forth in _Article VI_, as the case may be.

  



  

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for the equitable remedies set
forth in _Section 9.2_ or for any claims involving Fraud against any Person
who has committed Fraud, from and after the First Effective Time, the rights
set forth in this _Article VII_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

  



  

7.2 _Mechanics of Offset Right_.

  



  

(a) _Reduction of Milestone Payment_. At the time the Claimed
Damages are finally determined pursuant to the provisions of this _Section
7.2_, the FDA Milestone Consideration or the CMS Milestone Consideration, as
applicable, shall be reduced by the amount of the Claimed Damages.

  



  

   

 | 92| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) _Exercise of Offset Right_. To exercise the Offset Right,
Parent shall (on behalf of Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Parties
at issue) deliver to the Representative at the notice address set forth in
_Section 10.8_ (as the same may be amended from time to time as provided
therein and including all Persons to be copied on any notice to the
Representative), a certificate signed by Parent (a " _Claim Certificate_ "):
(a) stating in good faith that one or more of the Parent Indemnified Parties
has suffered or incurred Damages which are entitled to be recovered pursuant
to the Offset Right (the " _Claimed Damages_ "); and (b) specifying to the
extent practicable in reasonable detail the individual items of Claimed
Damages and the nature of the breach or other circumstance to which each such
item is related. Upon the timely delivery of a Claim Certificate stating a
_bona fide_ claim for Claimed Damages, and notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary, any distribution of the Milestone Consideration shall
be stayed pending final resolution in accordance herewith.

  



  

(c) _Perfection of Offset Right_. After the expiration of a
period of twenty (20) Business Days following the time of delivery of a Claim
Certificate to the Representative, the Offset Right shall be deemed perfected
as to the applicable Claimed Damages and the Milestone Consideration, as
applicable, shall be reduced pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ unless, prior to
the expiration of such period of twenty (20) Business Days, the
Representative objects in a written statement delivered to Parent to the
claims made in the Claim Certificate, setting forth in reasonable detail the
objections to the claim for Claimed Damages.

  



  

(d) _Objection to Offset Right_. If the Representative shall
timely object in writing to an exercise of the Offset Right by Parent, the
Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims within
twenty (20) Business Days after such objection. If the Representative and
Parent should so agree on a claim, a written memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by such parties, which shall include,
if applicable, a statement of the reduction in Milestone Consideration
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_.

  



  

(e) _Resolution of Offset Right_. If no agreement can be reached
after good faith negotiation between the Representative and Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_, then either Parent or the Representative may
pursue dispute resolution with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 9.9_.

  



  

(f) _Surviving Entity_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
if the Surviving Entity suffers, sustains or becomes subject to or incurs
any Damages, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Entity
as an Indemnified Person), Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its
ownership of the equity of the Surviving Entity, to suffer, sustain or become
subject to or incur such Damages.

  



  

(g) _Specific Element of Consideration_. The Offset Right is,
without limitation, (i) a specific element of the consideration that
induced Parent to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations as
contemplated herein and (ii) intended to be fully enforceable on the terms
provided in this _Article VII_.

  



  

(h) _No Duplication_. For purposes of this Agreement, Damages
shall be calculated after giving effect to any amounts actually
recovered from third parties, including amounts recovered under insurance
policies (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any self-insurance program or
similar arrangement) with respect to such Damages, and the net of any costs to
recover such amounts. Any Damages for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be determined without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving
rise to such Damages forming a basis for a claim for recovery under multiple
provisions of this _Article VII_.

  



  

7.3 _Survival_. Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, the
period during which claims for Damages may first be made (the "
_Claims Period_ ") for Damages arising out of, resulting from, or in
connection with the matters set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ shall commence at
the Closing and shall terminate and be of no further force or effect at 11:59
p.m. ET on the date that is the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) to the extent that a
claim shall have been asserted during the Claims Period, the Claims Period
shall be extended with respect to such claim until such claim shall have been
finally resolved or settled, and (ii) the survival period for claims for Fraud
shall commence at the Closing and shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect at 11:59 p.m. ET on the date that is the third (3rd) anniversary of
the Closing Date. The parties further acknowledge and agree that the time
periods set forth in this _Section 7.3 _for the assertion of claims under
this Agreement are the result of arms'-length negotiation among the parties
and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the
parties.

remedy is part of an agreement between Parent and its Subsidiaries and a
Governmental Authority, as applicable, then Parent shall pay to the Company a
fee equal to Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) (the " _Regulatory
Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer on the second Business Day following
the date of termination of this Agreement. In no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements
contained in _Section 8.3(a)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay the Regulatory
Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a
suit that results in a judgment against Parent for the Regulatory Termination
Fee, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, in each case,
together with interest on the amount of the Regulatory Termination Fee, as
applicable, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal, in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made. Each party further
acknowledges that the Regulatory Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather
is a reasonable amount that will compensate the receiving party in the
circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

(c) Subject to the proviso at the end of this sentence, in the
event the Regulatory Termination Fee is required to be paid by the terms
of this Agreement and is paid to the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_,
such payment of the Regulatory Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated
damages; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event of any Intentional Breach
by Parent, First Merger Sub or Second Merger Sub prior to such termination,
the Company shall be entitled to the payment of the Regulatory
Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_) and to
seek any damages (including, for the avoidance of doubt, damages of the type
referred to in _Section 9.3_), to the extent proven, resulting from or
arising out of such Intentional Breach (as reduced by any Regulatory
Termination Fee paid by Parent).

  



  

8.4 _Continuation Convertible Note Payments_.

  



  

(a) In the event (i) the Closing has not occurred on or before
11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 31, 2021 and this Agreement is not
earlier terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, and (ii) the Company is not in
breach in any material respect of its obligations under this Agreement in any
manner that shall have proximately caused the failure of the First Effective
Time to occur prior to the date on which a Continuation Convertible Note
Payment (as defined below) is due, for each full calendar month beginning on
or after January 1, 2021, Parent shall make a payment to the Company in an
amount equal to the excess of One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($125,000,000) over the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents
reflected on the Company's balance sheet at the end of such calendar month,
if any (each, a " _Continuation Convertible Note Payment_ "), memorialized by
an unsecured convertible promissory note in a form with such terms as is
mutually agreed between Buyer and the Company and otherwise set forth in this
_Section 8.4_, by wire transfer no later than the tenth (10th) Business
Day following the last day of each month (beginning January 31, 2021) until
the earlier of (a) the Closing Date or (b) the termination of this Agreement
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1_ (such date, the "
_Continuation End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have
no obligation to make any Continuation Convertible Note Payment unless and
until the Company Conditions have been satisfied. The Company shall use the
Continuation Convertible Note Payment for general working capital purposes in
the Ordinary Course, including the repayment of debt. For the avoidance of
doubt, no additional Continuation Convertible Note Payments shall be payable
by Parent in relation to periods after the Continuation End Date.

  



  

(b) Upon the date which is the later of (i) sixty (60) days after
the date of termination of this Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "), and
(ii) three (3) Business Days after satisfaction or waiver (where permissible)
of the Issuance Conditions, any issued promissory notes issued in
consideration for Continuation Convertible Note Payments shall
automatically convert, and the Company shall issue and deliver to Parent, a
number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Series B-1
Preferred Stock equal to (A) the aggregate amount of all Continuation
Convertible Note Payments actually paid by Parent to the Company (the "
_Investment Amount_ "), divided by (B) the Issue Price (the "
_Equity Issuance_ "); _provided_ , that, prior to consummation of the Equity
Issuance, Parent may elect (in its sole discretion) to require the Company to
pay Parent an amount of cash equal to the Investment Amount, and, upon such
payment being received by Parent, the Company shall have no further liability
pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not be
obliged to consummate the Equity Issuance.

  



  

(c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Conditions to be satisfied prior to the date that the first payment
by Parent to the Company of any Continuation Convertible Note Payment is
payable. Parent irrevocably agrees that it shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to), upon the written request of the Company, vote any shares of
capital stock of the Company held by it to approve all matters and execute
any written consents and/or amendments or restatements of the Company
Governing Documents, in each case as are reasonably necessary to satisfy the
Company Conditions.

  



  

   

 | 96| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, any and all Continuation
Convertible Note Payments shall be treated as indebtedness of the Company,
and not the purchase of equity or a payment to shareholders, for all U.S.
federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes.

  



  

(e) As used in this _Section 8.4_:

  



  

(i) " _Non-Voting Common Stock_ " shall mean a series of common
stock of the Company having substantially the same terms as the
Company's currently authorized Common Stock, except that (1) shares of Non-

other corporate approvals and adopted and filed with the Secretary of State

issuance of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Non-Voting Common Stock
into which such Series B-1 Preferred Stock may be converted.

  



  

(B) The Company shall have either (x) received such waivers or
amendments as are reasonably required under its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and the Company Governing Documents to permit the
consummation of the Equity Issuance, including the waiver of any
preemptive rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or similar
rights of any stockholder of the Company with respect to the Equity Issuance,
or (y) notified Parent that it has complied with any such preemptive rights,
rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or similar rights of any
stockholder of the Company with respect to the Equity Issuance.

  



  

(C) The Company shall have complied in all material respects with
_Section 5.1_.

Law shall be pending, and (C) any waiting period under the HSR Act, if

(vi) " _Series B-1 Preferred Stock_" shall mean a series of
preferred stock of the Company having substantially the same terms as the

required by applicable law, shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall have
no voting rights (including with respect to a vote on mandatory conversion in
connection with a Qualified IPO (as defined in the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation)), other than the right to approve (x) the amendment,
alteration or repeal of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company in a manner that alters or changes the powers,
preferences or rights of the shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock so as to
adversely affect them disproportionately to any other series or class of
stock (it being understood that the creation of a new series of
preferred stock shall not be deemed to alter or change the powers,
preferences, or rights of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock or otherwise require
the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of the Series B-1
Preferred Stock), and (y) any waiver of any adjustment to the conversion
price for the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (iii) holders of Series B-1
Preferred Stock will have no rights to designate a member of the Company
Board, (iv) upon transfer by the holder thereof to a third party, a share of
Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into a share of Series
B Preferred Stock if such conversion satisfies the Regulatory Condition and
(v) the Series B-1 Preferred Stock shall otherwise be convertible into shares
of Non-Voting Common Stock of the Company on substantially the same terms on
which the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock.

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

9.1 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 9.14_ or as
otherwise expressly provided herein (including _Section 5.6_,  _Section
8.3(a)_ and _Article VIII_), each party will bear its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, whether or not the Mergers are
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay all filing fees
payable for filings required or otherwise made pursuant to the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Laws, and the Company shall not be required to pay
any fees or other payments to any Governmental authority in connection with
any filings under the HSR Act or such other filings as may be required under
applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with the Mergers or the other
Transactions. The costs and expenses incurred by the Exchange Agent shall
be paid by Parent.

  



  

9.2 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money
damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such
damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand,
or Parent and the Merger Subs, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Parent and the Merger
Subs, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with,
the covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable) under
this Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 98| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the
Merger Subs, on the other hand, agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company or
Parent or the Merger Subs, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
the Company or Parent and the Merger Subs, as applicable, under this
Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction. The parties hereto
further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
9.2_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.2_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.2_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.2_ restrict or limit any party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 9.2(a)_ and  _Section
9.2(b)_, in no case shall any party be entitled to specifically enforce the
terms of this Agreement or to seek equitable remedy in any court other than
the Chosen Courts.

  



  

(c) Subject to _Section 7.1(c)_, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

  



  

9.3 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in
_Article VIII_ and _Section 5.12_, this Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the parties, the Parent
Indemnified Parties, the Seller Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs, representatives, successors and permitted assigns. The foregoing shall
not adversely affect the Parent Indemnified Parties' rights pursuant to any
Stockholder Support Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither shall
it have any impact on the obligations of each counterparty executing the same.

  



  

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Schedules,
Exhibits and Annexes hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and the other documents, instruments and
agreements referred to herein that relate to the Transactions (including the
Transaction Documents), constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties, written
or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof.

  



  

9.5 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their
respective heirs, representatives, successors and permitted assigns. No party
may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of Parent, the
Representative and the Company; _provided_ , that Parent and the Merger Subs
may, without the consent of any Person, assign in whole or in part their
rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to (a) one or more of its
Affiliates, (b) any successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of
the business and assets of Parent or its Affiliates or (c) any lender to
Parent or any of its Affiliates as security for obligations to such lender.

  



  

9.6 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts (including by means of fax, email,
Portable Document Format (PDF) file, Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
file or other electronic transmissions), each of which shall be deemed an
original but all of which, when taken together, will constitute one and the
same agreement. No party shall raise the use of fax, email or other
electronic transmission to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature
or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
fax, email, PDF, JPEG or other electronic transmission as a defense to
the formation or enforceability of this Agreement, and each party forever
waives any such defense.

9.10 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Closing Date

subsequent such occurrence.

  



  

9.11 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that

the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be included in another
section thereof solely to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such
other section is reasonably apparent on its face. Any information provided in
the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule is solely
for information purposes, and the inclusion of such information shall not be
deemed to enlarge or enhance in any way any of the covenants, agreements,
representations or warranties under this Agreement or otherwise alter in any
way the terms of this Agreement. The inclusion of any information in any
section of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule
or other document delivered by the parties pursuant to this Agreement shall
not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of the materiality of such item,
nor shall it establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

  



  

9.13 _Consent to Representation_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its directors, members, partners, officers, employees, and
Affiliates that Goodwin Procter LLP currently serves as counsel to the
Company, certain Sellers and their respective Affiliates in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement Parent, the First-Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving
Entity, and the Company hereby agree that Goodwin Procter LLP (or any
successor) may represent (i) the Sellers or the Representative or any of
their respective Affiliates or agents or any one or more of them (individually
and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") after the Closing in connection
with any dispute, litigation, claim or Legal Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, including a dispute that arises after the Closing
between Parent and Representative, and (ii) the Seller Group or any
director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group
in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) above,
notwithstanding any prior representation by Goodwin Procter LLP of any other
Person. Each of the Parties hereto consents thereto, and waives any conflict
of interest arising therefrom, and each such Party shall cause any Affiliate
thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising from
such representation. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that such
consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and
that the Parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should
do so in this connection.

  



  

   

 | 102| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Parent, Merger Subs, and the Company further agree that all
communications at or prior to the Closing between Goodwin Procter LLP and any
member of the Seller Group to the extent relating to the negotiation of this
Agreement, and all associated rights to assert, waive and otherwise
administer the attorney-client privilege and right of confidentiality of any
member of the Seller Group, will, from and after the Closing, rest
exclusively with the Representative and will not be transferred, assigned,
conveyed or delivered, by operation of law or otherwise, to Parent, the
First-Step Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity or any of the
Affiliates or any successor or assign of any of the foregoing.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and a third party (other than a Party to this Agreement or any
of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Surviving Entity
(including on behalf of its Subsidiaries) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Goodwin
Procter LLP to such third party; _provided_ , that neither the Surviving
Entity nor any of its Subsidiaries may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Representative which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

9.14 _Representative_.

  



  

(a) _Appointment_. Each Seller, by the execution of this
Agreement (and/or delivery of an executed Key Stockholder Support Agreement or
Support Agreement, as applicable), by voting in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement, the approval of the principal terms of the Mergers, and the
consummation of the Mergers or participating in the Mergers and receiving the
benefits thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Mergers, hereby irrevocably appoints Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as of the Closing as the exclusive
representative, agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all
purposes in connection with this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto (the " _Representative_ ") (including the full power and authority on
such Seller's behalf (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein,
including to execute and deliver the Exchange Agent Agreement; (ii) to
endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments of assignment as
Parent shall reasonably request; (iii) to execute and deliver on behalf of
such Seller any amendment, waiver, ancillary agreement and documents on
behalf of any Seller that the Representative deems necessary or appropriate;
(iv) to give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent, the
First-Step Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Entity (on behalf of itself
or any other Seller) relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to the extent that
this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication
shall be given or received by such Sellers individually); (v) object to
claims pursuant to _Sections 7.1_ ; (vi) consent or agree to, negotiate,
enter into, or, if applicable, prosecute or defend, settlements and
compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to, such
claims; (vii) to provide any consents or agreements hereunder, including with
respect to any proposed settlement of any claims or to any amendment to this
Agreement; (viii) to bring a claim seeking to recover, and if successful,
recover amounts payable by Parent to Seller Indemnified Parties hereunder;
and (ix) to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each case without
having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance).

are therefore irrevocable and shall survive the death, incapacity,
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All decisions and
actions (including the execution of any agreement or document) by the
Representative on behalf of any Seller (to the extent authorized by this
Agreement) shall be binding upon such Seller, and no such Seller shall have
the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. Each
Seller agrees that Parent shall be entitled to rely on any action taken
by Representative, on behalf of such Seller, pursuant to this _Section
9.14_, and that each such action shall be binding on each Seller as fully as
if such Seller had taken such action. No bond shall be required of the
Representative.

(b) _Authorization_. Notwithstanding _Section 9.14(a)_, in the
event that the Representative, upon the advice of legal counsel, is of
the opinion that it requires further authorization from the Sellers on any
matters concerning this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement, the
Representative shall be entitled to seek such further authorization from the
Sellers prior to acting on their behalf. The appointment of the
Representative is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any
Seller in any manner or for any reason. This authority granted to the
Representative shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution,
disability, incapacity or other inability to act of any principal pursuant to
any applicable Law.

  



  

(c) _Actions by the Representative; Resignation; Vacancies_. The
Representative may resign from its capacity as the Representative at any time
by written notice delivered to Parent. If there is a vacancy at any time in
the position of the Representative for any reason, such vacancy shall be
filled by the holders of a majority in interest of the former Company
Stockholders upon not less than ten (10) days' prior written notice to
Parent, in which case the references to Representative shall include the
replacement.

  



  

(d) _No Liability_. All acts of the Representative hereunder in
its capacity as such shall be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Sellers and
not of the Representative individually. The Representative shall not be liable
to the Sellers, in connection with the Representative's services pursuant to
this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, for any liability of any
kind, including any liability of any Seller, or otherwise or for any error of
judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith or
for any mistake in fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain
from doing in connection with this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement,
except in the case of the Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel in the event
of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of
this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement or its duties hereunder or
thereunder, and the Representative shall not be liable for any action or
omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Representative shall not by
reason of this Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement have a fiduciary
relationship in respect of any Seller.

  



  

(e) _Expenses_. Any expenses or taxable income incurred by the
Representative in connection with the performance of its duties under this
Agreement or the Exchange Agent Agreement shall not be the personal
obligation of the Representative but shall be payable by and attributable to
the Sellers based on each such Seller's Percentage Interest. The Sellers will
indemnify (severally and not jointly based on each such Seller's respective
Seller's Percentage Interest in the Merger Consideration), defend and hold
harmless the Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Representative's acceptance or administration of the
Representative's duties hereunder, under the Exchange Agent Agreement or any
other agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred, after written notice thereof to the Sellers; _provided_
, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally
adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Representative, the Representative will reimburse the
Sellers pro rata according to each such Person's respective Seller's
Percentage Interest of the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to
the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not
paid directly to the Representative by the Sellers, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Representative from (i) first, the Expense
Fund and (ii) second, any other funds that become payable to the Sellers under
this Agreement at such time as such amounts would otherwise be distributable
to the Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that while this Section allows the
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources, this does not
relieve the Sellers from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Sellers or otherwise. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that
the foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or
removal of the Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(f) _Expense Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall wire to the
Representative the Expense Fund Amount. The Expense Fund Amount shall be
held by the Representative in a segregated client account and shall be used
for the purposes of paying directly or reimbursing the Representative for any
Representative Losses incurred pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Expense
Fund_ "). The Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of the
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative
will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these
funds for any corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds
available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Representative
is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection
with the Expense Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution
obligations. The Sellers will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Representative any
such interest or earnings. As soon as reasonably determined by the
Representative that the Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld,
the Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense Fund (if any)
to Parent for further distribution to the Sellers.

  



  

(g) After the Closing, any notice or communication given or
received by, and any decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of,
the Representative that is within the scope of the Representative's authority
under _Section 9.14(a)_ shall constitute a notice or communication to or by,
or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Sellers
and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Seller; and each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to rely upon any such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as
being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of, each and every such Seller.
