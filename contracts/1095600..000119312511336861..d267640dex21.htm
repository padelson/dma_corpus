ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01. _The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary
shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 300 N.
LaSalle Drive, Chicago, Illinois

 



10  60654, on the later of (i) two Business Days after the date the conditions
set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied
or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefit of such conditions, and (ii) the earlier to occur of (A) during the
Marketing Period, on a date specified by Parent on three (3) Business Days
written notice to the Company and (B) the first Business Day immediately
following the final day of the Marketing Period, or at such other place, at
such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree.

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger in customary form and substance with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings
required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of
merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or
at such later time as may be mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent and
as specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b) or Section 2.05, each
share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any Company Stock issued upon the exercise or conversion of any
Company Warrant or Company Convertible Notes for or into Company Stock by the
holder thereof prior to the Effective Time) shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive $25.81 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration");

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other
than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.03.  _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Warrant outstanding at the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished,
and each holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
other than the right to receive, in respect of each share of Company Stock
that would be obtainable upon exercise of such Company Warrant

 



11  as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to $5.05 in
cash, without interest (the "Warrant Consideration"). Each holder of a Company
Warrant shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement
with respect to its right to receive the Warrant Consideration pursuant to
this Article 2.

Section 2.04. _Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares") and
exchanging the Warrant Consideration for each share of Company Stock subject
to the Company Warrants. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares and the Warrant
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Warrants (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, the In-the-Money Company Stock Option Merger Consideration
or the Company RSU Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of In-the-Money
Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, respectively). All cash deposited with
the Exchange Agent may not be used for any purpose not provided in this
Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before
the Effective Time. Any income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. Promptly after the Effective Time (but
in no event later than five Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company
Stock at the Effective Time (other than the Company, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, or holders of Dissenting
Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of appraisal)
a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation, and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the
Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest or dividends
will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay in advance to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes
required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



12 (d) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to pay to each holder of a Company Warrant as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time the Warrant Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Warrant, payable to such holder pursuant to
Section 2.03 in accordance with joint written instructions provided by the
Company and the holder of such Company Warrant to the Exchange Agent.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock or transfers of Company Warrants. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Warrants are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Warrant
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 2.

 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.04(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time when
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.05 in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

Section 2.05. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with Section
2.02(b) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Delaware Law (such shares
being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall
be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in accordance
with Delaware Law; _provided_ that if, after the Effective Time, such holder
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal pursuant to Delaware Law, such shares of Company Stock shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share or transfer of such 

 



13  Uncertificated Share, as the case may be, in compliance with Section 2.03.
The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of
any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to
such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate
in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
under Delaware Law consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.
From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity
owner of the Surviving Company or of a stockholder of Parent.

Section 2.06. _Company Equity Awards_. (a) At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock outstanding
under any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Stock Option") that has an exercise
price per share of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (the
"Option Exercise Price") that is less than the Merger Consideration (each such
Company Stock Option, an "In-the-Money Company Stock Option"), whether or not
exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the excess of the
Merger Consideration over the Option Exercise Price of such In-the-Money
Company Stock Option by (B) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
such In-the-Money Company Stock Option (such amount, the "In-the-Money Company
Stock Option Merger Consideration"). Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay the In-the-Money Company Stock Option
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, at or reasonably promptly
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after
the Effective Time). At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option that has an Option Exercise Price that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, whether or not exercisable or vested,
shall be cancelled without any consideration therefor.

 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Stock
granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions under any Company
Stock Plan (each, a "Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of
such restrictions as of the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time,
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.02(a) and under the same terms and conditions as
apply to the receipt of the Merger Consideration by holders of Company Stock
generally.

 

(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share unit
with respect to shares of Company Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan
(each, a "Company RSU") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive (i) an amount
in cash equal to (A) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the
Merger Consideration (such amount, the "Company RSU Merger Consideration").
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company RSU Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, at or reasonably promptly after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business Days after the
Effective Time).

 



14 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan)
shall adopt such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a
meeting, providing for the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.06. The
Company shall provide that, following the Effective Time, no holder of any
Company Stock Option, Company Restricted Share or Company RSU shall have the
right to acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving
Corporation in respect thereof.

 

(e) The holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and
Company RSUs shall have the right to enforce, and shall be beneficiaries with
respect to, the provisions of this Section 2.06.

(f) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof
administering the ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to provide that, with respect to the ESPP: (i)
each individual participating in the offering period in progress as of the
date of this Agreement (the "Final Offering") shall not be permitted (x) to
increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder
from the rate in effect when the Final Offering commenced, or (y) to make
separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP on or following the date of
this Agreement; (ii) no individual who is not participating in the ESPP as
of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the ESPP
following the date of this Agreement; (iii) the Final Offering shall end on
the earlier to occur of February 29, 2012, and a date that is five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time; (iv) all amounts allocated to each
participants account under the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used
to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Stock at the applicable
price determined under the terms of the ESPP; and (v) no further offering
periods shall start or rights shall be granted or exercised under the ESPP
thereafter; and (vi) the ESPP shall terminate immediately following the end of
the Final Offering and. All shares of Company Stock purchased in the Final
Offering shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Stock,
Company Warrants, Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares or Company
RSUs, as applicable, in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

Section 2.08. _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the delivery by such Person of a written indemnity
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any

 



15  claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
2.

ARTICLE 3

accordance with Applicable Law.

 

Section 3.02. _Bylaws._ The bylaws of the Company shall be amended at the

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Subject to Section 11.05, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as otherwise described in the Company SEC Documents (other than
(x) any disclosures contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk
Factors", "Forward-Looking Statements", "Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other disclosures contained or
referenced therein that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature, and (y) any exhibits or other documents appended thereto) filed on or
after April 30, 2011 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Recent SEC
Reports") (it being understood that any matter disclosed in any Recent SEC
Report shall be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and to qualify the Companys representations and warranties
hereunder only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from such
disclosure in such Recent SEC Report that such disclosure is applicable to
such section of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that:

Section 4.01. _Corporate Existence and Power._ (a) The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as currently conducted, except for those
powers, licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence
of which would not

 



16  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation and (where applicable) is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.

(b) Complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Company, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, are included
or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). Assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of equity).

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors has
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii)
adopted, approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) resolved, subject to Section 6.03, to
recommend approval of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation,
the "Company Board Recommendation").

 

Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (a) the
filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,
(b) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Applicable Law of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States ("Foreign Antitrust Laws"), (c)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and any

31 Section 5.06. _Financing_. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete
and correct copies of (i) the fully executed commitment letter and a Redacted
Fee Letter, each dated as of December 6, 2011, from Jefferies Finance LLC and
Jefferies and Company, Inc. (the "Commitment Parties," together with each of
their Affiliates, successors and assigns, and each of their officers,
employees, directors, partners, former, current or future equityholders,
controlling parties, members, managers, general or limited partners, advisors,
agents and representatives, the "Financing Sources") (the "Debt Commitment
Letters") confirming their respective commitments to provide Parent with debt
financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Debt
Financing") and (ii) fully executed commitment letters (the "Equity Commitment
Letters," and together with the Debt Commitment Letters, the "Financing
Commitment Letters") from each of the parties listed on Annex II hereto (the
"Funding Parties") confirming the respective counterparties commitments to
provide Parent with equity financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Equity Financing," and together with the Debt
Financing, the "Financing"). Assuming that the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitment Letters is fully funded, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient to consummate the Merger
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees and
expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their respective Representatives
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) The Equity Commitment Letters are each in full force and effect and are
valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto. Each
of the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto. Parent or Merger Subsidiary has fully paid any and all
commitment or other fees in connection with the Financing Commitment Letters
that are payable on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, none
of the Financing Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any
respect, no such amendment or modification is contemplated and the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise
modified in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any
Financing Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent to the funding
of the full amount of the Financing other than the conditions precedent set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, and Parent has no reason to believe
that any term or condition of closing of the Financing that is required to
be satisfied will not be satisfied, or that the Financing will not be made
available to Parent on the date of the Closing. There are no side letters or
other Contracts to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to
the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing
other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters.

(c) The Debt Commitment Letters may, in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, be superseded at the option of Parent after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the "Alternative
Financing Commitments") replacing the then existing Debt Commitment Letters,
provided that any Alternative Financing Commitment shall be on terms that are
no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as determined in the
reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters
such Alternative Financing Commitment is replacing. In such event, (x) the
term "Financing Commitment Letters" as used herein shall be deemed to include
the Financing Commitment Letters that are

 



32  not so superseded at the time in question and the Alternative Financing
Commitments to the extent then in effect, and (y) the term "Debt Financing" as
used herein shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing clause (x).

Section 5.07. _Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guaranty. The Guaranty
is in full force and effect as of the date hereof and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each Guarantor in
accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity). No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of any
Guarantor under the Guaranty.

 

Section 5.08. _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing and the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration and other consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.06, (b) the truth and accuracy of the representations
and warranties in Article 4 hereof, (c) any estimates, projections or
forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been prepared by them in
good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, (d) payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (e) payment of
all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Solvent," when used with respect to any Person, means
that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable
value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the
value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with Applicable Law governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For
the purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" mean that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

Section 5.09. _Certain Arrangements_. There are no Contracts or commitments to
enter into Contracts (a) between Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantors or
any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or (b)
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration
or pursuant

 



33  to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

Section 6.02. _Company Stockholder Meeting; Record Date._ (a) The Company
shall cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting")
to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable following
clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC for the purpose of voting on the
approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting
(i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to the Companys stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) as otherwise required by Applicable Law
or (iii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled as set forth in the Proxy Statement, there are insufficient shares
of Company Stock represented (in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject
to Section 6.03, the Board of Directors of the Company shall (A) recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby by the Companys stockholders, (B) take all reasonably
lawful action to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (C) otherwise
comply with all legal requirements applicable to such meeting. Notwithstanding
any Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with Article 10, this Agreement
shall be submitted to the holders of Company Stock for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall, upon the
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least on a daily basis on each
of the last ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the

 



37  Company Stockholder Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies
received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.

 

(b) The Company shall establish a record date for purposes of determining the
holders of Company Stock entitled to notice of and vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the "Record Date"). Once the Company has established the
Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a
different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by Applicable Law. In the
event that the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting as originally called is
for any reason adjourned or postponed or otherwise delayed, the Company
agrees that unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall
implement such adjournment or postponement or other delay in such a way that
the Company does not establish a new Record Date for the Company Stockholder
Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as required by
Applicable Law.

Section 6.03. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Subject to Sections 6.03(b),
6.03(c) and 6.03(f), (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit
any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, directly or indirectly,
(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by
providing information in a manner designed to knowingly encourage) the
submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) enter into or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any confidential information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, any Third Party for the purpose of knowingly facilitating or
encouraging (or which could reasonably be expected to facilitate or encourage)
an Acquisition Proposal, (C) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any
standstill or confidentiality agreement or (D) approve, endorse or enter into
any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar instrument relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that is intended to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal or requires the Company to abandon this Agreement
(an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") and (ii) neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (A) fail to make,
withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw (or not continue to make), qualify or modify) in a manner adverse to
Parent the Company Board Recommendation, (B) adopt, approve or recommend or
propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise) an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) (x) fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal
or (y) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation, in each case of
(x) and (y) within five (5) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing,
(D) fail to recommend against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation
14D under the Exchange Act in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 within ten Business Days after the commencement of such
Acquisition Proposal, or (E) fail to include the recommendation of the Board
of Directors of the Company in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger in the Proxy Statement (any action described in the
foregoing clauses (A) through (E), an "Adverse Recommendation Change");
_provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination by
the Board of Directors that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (2) the disclosure by

 



38  the Company of such determination or (3) the delivery by the Company of the
notice required by the last sentence of this Section 6.03 shall constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change). 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), if at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives has
received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Third Party that
the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes could lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third
Party and its Representatives and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or its
Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Company shall make available to Parent any material non-
public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is made
available to such Third Party which was not previously made available to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is made
available to such Third Party; _provided further_ , that prior to taking any
action described in Section 6.03(b)(i) or Section 6.03(b)(ii) above, (A) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall determine in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to the holders of
Company Stock under Applicable Law and (B) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall determine in good faith, based on the information then available
and after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal. Without
modifying the generality of the foregoing, in making such determinations the
Board of Directors of the Company shall take into consideration, among other
factors: (x) whether such Third Party is reasonably likely to have adequate
sources of financing or adequate funds to consummate such Acquisition Proposal
and (y) whether such Third Party has given reasonable assurances that it will
not propose obtaining financing or stockholder approval of such Third Partys
stockholders as a condition to its obligation to consummate such Acquisition
Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to
a material development or change in material circumstances occurring or
arising after the date hereof, the existence and material consequences of
which were not known by the Company Board of Directors at or prior to the
date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal, which shall be
governed by Section 6.03(f)) (such material development or change in
circumstances, an "Intervening Event") and after consultation with outside
legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely
to violate its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Stock under
Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with such Intervening Event; _provided_
that, if the Company is making an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
any such Intervening Event, then the Board of Directors shall not make such
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company has (i) provided to Parent
at least three Business Days prior written notice that it intends to take
such action and specifying in reasonable detail the facts underlying the
decision by the Board of Directors of the Company to take such action and
(ii) during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



39 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or its Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under Applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act (or any similar communication
to stockholders) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934
Act; provided, however, the Company shall not effect, or disclose pursuant to
such rules or otherwise a position which constitutes an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless specifically permitted by this Section 6.03.

 

(e) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and, in any event, within 36
hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the Third Party making, and
the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements) and (ii) the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal (including any
amendments thereto and any change in the Companys intentions as previously
notified) and shall provide copies of all correspondence and other written
materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Representatives
relating to any such material developments, discussions or negotiations.

(f) Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal,
unless (A) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B)
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary
obligations under Applicable Law, (C) the Company shall have complied with
its obligations under this Section 6.03 with respect to such Superior
Proposal, (D) the Company promptly notifies Parent in writing, at least three
Business Days before taking such action, of the determination of the Board of
Directors of the Company that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and of its intention to take such action, attaching the most current
version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is
proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Third Party making such
Superior Proposal and, during such three Business Day period, the Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and (if applicable) the Financing Commitment Letters and/or the
Guaranty, so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new three
Business Day period under this Section 6.03(f)).

(g) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Representatives takes
any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this
Section 6.03, then the Company shall be deemed to be in breach of this Section
6.03.

 



40 (h) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal
for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith by a majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, and after taking into consideration, among other
things, all of the terms, conditions, impact and all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement,
including financing, regulatory approvals, shareholder litigation, identity
of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal (including whether
stockholder approval of such Third Party is required), breakup fee and expense
reimbursement provisions and other events or circumstances beyond the control
of the Company, that such Acquisition Proposal would be, if consummated, more
favorable to the holders of Company Stock (in their capacity as such) than the
Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(f)).

Section 6.04. _Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (a) give to Parent, its counsel, financial
advisors, auditors, financing sources and other authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries,

its investigation. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish, to the extent prepared by the Company in the

statements of the Company, including statements of financial condition,
results of operations, and statements of cash flow, and all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted under
supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such manner as not
to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company.

Section 6.05. _Financing Cooperation_. (a) The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
their reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide
all cooperation that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent (provided
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i)
participation in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence

 



41  sessions, lender presentations, "road shows" and sessions with rating
agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) furnishing Parent and its Debt

Company and its Subsidiaries, including information required under "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, all financial

registration statements, documents and certificates shall be executed and
delivered except in connection with the Closing, (B) the effectiveness thereof
shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the
Closing and (C) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its
Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur
any liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time
and (D) no personal liability shall be imposed on the officers, directors,
employees or agents involved), and (vi) obtaining any intellectual property
assignment agreements relating to the Company Products, and making
all necessary filings with governmental registration agencies to update
ownership title in and to effectuate the release of any security interests
granted in the Company Registered IP.

 

(b) Parent shall promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable

COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01. _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. _ Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

 



42 Section 7.02. _Voting of Shares._ Parent shall vote or cause to be voted all
shares of Company Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries
in favor of adoption and approval of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder
Meeting.

Section 7.03. _Indemnification and Insurance._ Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors,
employees and agents (including fiduciaries with respect to employee benefit
plans) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including acts or omissions with respect to the adoption
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby) to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law.

 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (or in such
documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in
existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,
any agreement between any Indemnified Person, on the one hand, and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, regarding elimination of
liability, indemnification or advancement of expenses shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for a non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting
or discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
with respect to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the
Effective Time (including claims with respect to the adoption of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the selection of such "tail" insurance policy and the Company
shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with
respect thereto; and _provided_ that the cost per annum payable for such
"tail" insurance policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full year of coverage (ending December 18, 2011)
(which amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule) (such maximum amount, the "Maximum Tail Premium") and if the cost
for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium, then the
Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys of
its property and assets to any Person,

 



43  then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.03 (including this Section 7.03(d)).

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.03 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

Section 7.04. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of 12 months following the
Closing, with respect to United States employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who remain employed during
the requisite period ("Company Employees"), Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, provide compensation and employee benefits that,
taken as a whole, are comparable in the aggregate to those provided under the
US Plans as of the date hereof, but excluding from such comparability
requirement all equity-based compensation and benefits and change in control
arrangements.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.04(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume, honor and continue during the twelve-month period following the
Effective Time or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all of the Companys employment, severance, CIC retention
and termination plans and agreements that are set forth on Section 7.04(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedules, in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or
in combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification,
other than any amendment or modification required to comply with Applicable
Law or with the consent of the applicable Company Employee.

(c) With respect to any 401(k), vacation , paid-time off and severance plans
maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates in which
Company Employees are entitled to participate, for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, and vesting, each
Company Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in any duplication of benefits or compensation.

 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any health
benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) 

 



44  will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time and in the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under any health benefit plans in which they will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time and in the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs. 

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section
7.04 or any other provision of this Agreement (i) shall create any right or
remedy (including any third-party beneficiary right) in any Person, including
any employees, former employees, any participant in any Employee Plan or any
beneficiary thereof, nor create any right to employment or continued
employment or any term or condition of employment with Parent, Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, nor prevent or otherwise
restrict the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of
any Company Employee, (ii) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify
any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, contract or
arrangement, or (iii) shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, agreement, contract or arrangement at any
time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, subject to
a participants consent if required by the terms thereof.

Section 7.05.  _Financing_. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitment Letters, and shall not permit
any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision
under, the Financing Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or
waiver (i) reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount
of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount unless (A) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing
is increased by a corresponding amount and (B) after giving effect to any of
the transactions referred to in clause (A) above, the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 5.08 shall be true) or (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any
other provision of the Financing Commitment Letters in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (A) delay or prevent or make less likely the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the
date of the Closing or (B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing
Commitment Letters (provided that, subject to compliance with the other
provisions of this Section 5.06(c), Parent and Merger Subsidiary may amend
the Debt Commitment Letters to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners
and agents). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification or replacement.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts
(i) to maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitment Letters,
(ii) to negotiate and enter

 



45  into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letters on
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on terms
no less favorable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary than the terms and
conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters), (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letters and such definitive
agreements with respect thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter and to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing and (iv) to comply with
its obligations under the Financing Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide to the Company copies of
the material definitive agreements for the Debt Financing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give
the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach or default by any party to any of
the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which Parent or Merger Subsidiary becomes aware, (B) of the
receipt of (x) any written notice or (y) other written communication, in each
case from any Financing source with respect to any (1) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation
to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing
and (C) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing. As promptly as practicable, but in any
event within two Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or
Merger Subsidiary a written request therefor, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that
the obtaining of the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a
condition to Closing.

may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or 10.01(c)(iii) or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), then the
Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent in immediately
available funds, in the case of a termination by Parent, within two Business
Days after such termination and, in the case of a termination by the Company,
immediately before and as a condition to such termination.

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii) or by Parent pursuant to
Section 10.01(c)(ii) (but only if the failure to satisfy the condition
specified therein results from an intentional breach by the Company of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein),
(B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of (1) the date
of such termination and (2) the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting,
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
communicated to the Companys stockholders and (C) within 12 months following
the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds, concurrently with such consummation, the Company Termination Fee;
_provided_ that for purposes of this Section 11.04(b)(ii), all references to
"20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be

Proposal" shall be deemed to be deleted.

 



54 (iii) The "Company Termination Fee" shall equal $39,000,000.

(iv) In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

specified therein results from an intentional breach by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary of any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained herein) or Section 10.01(d)(iii), then Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid to the Company in immediately available funds
$73,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") within two Business Days after such

(ii) In no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

 

(d) _Other Costs and Expenses_.

(i) Each party acknowledges that (A) the agreements contained in this Section
11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(B) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b) or Section 11.04(c) are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. 

(e) _Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to the Companys rights set forth in Section
11.13, (i) the Companys right to receive payment of an amount equal to the
Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the Guarantors pursuant to the Guaranty
in respect thereof shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and the Company Related Parties against Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Guarantors, any of their respective former, current and future
direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners or assignees (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties")
and the Financing Sources for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise and (ii)
upon payment of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties or
the Financing Sources shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Parents rights set forth in Section 11.04(d)(i) and 11.13, (A) Parents
right to receive payment from the Company

 



55  of an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
11.04(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, "Company
Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise)or otherwise and (B)
upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance
of doubt, (1) under no circumstances will the Parent Related Parties or the
Financing Sources be liable for monetary damages in excess of the amount of
the Parent Termination Fee (and any amounts payable to the Company pursuant to
Sections 6.05(b) and 11.04(d)) whether to the Company or any other Company
Related Party and, with respect to the Financing Sources, the Financing
Sources shall have no liability to the Company or any Company Related Party
for any consequential, incidental, indirect or punitive damages, (2) while
the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
Section 11.13 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under Section
11.04(c), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific performance and money damages, including
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee and (3) at any time Parent
shall have the right to satisfy in full any claim by the Company for money
damages by consummating the Merger in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Schedule References._ The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure
for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the relevant party that are contained in the corresponding
Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and warranties of
such party that is contained in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of
that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be readily apparent to a reasonable
person who has read that reference and such representations and warranties,
without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the
matter(s) so disclosed. The mere inclusion of an item in the Company
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or
material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect_ ; _Benefit_ ; _Assignment. (a) _The
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except as provided in Article 2 and Section
7.03, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns;
_provided_ that the Financing Sources (including any source of
alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and
satisfies the conditions of, Section 7.05) shall be intended third parties
beneficiaries of Sections 11.04(e), 11.06, 11.08, 11.09 and 11.13(b)(v) and
shall be entitled to enforce such provisions directly (and no amendment or
modification to such provisions in respect to the Financing Sources (including
any source of alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with,
and satisfies the 

 



56  conditions of, Section 7.05) may be made without the prior consent of the
Financing Sources (including any source of alternative financing that has been
obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 7.05)).

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, by operation of law
or otherwise, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger
Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of its
Affiliates and/or to any parties providing the Financing pursuant to the terms
thereof (including for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assign as collateral in respect of such Financing) at any time and
(ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party
hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 11.06(b) shall be null and void.

Section 11.07. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state. 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. The parties
hereto agree that a final trial court judgment in any such suit, action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law;
_provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any partys

Section 11.10.  _Counterparts_ ; _Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement; No Other Representations and Warranties._
(a) This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as

to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4,
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that neither the Company nor
any Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to Parent
or Merger Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject
to any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, or Parents or Merger Subsidiarys use of, any such information,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, unless, and then only to the extent that, any such information
is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in Article 4.

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 5, the
Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall relieve any Person of
liability for fraud or willful misconduct. 

 



58 Section 11.12. _Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.13. _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies of Parent and Merger Subsidiary_.

 

(i) _Specific Performance_. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 10, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described
in Section 11.08 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
including the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger.

(ii) _Company Termination Fee_. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section 11.04(b)
hereof.

(iii) _Termination_. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Article 10 hereof.

 

(iv) _Monetary Damages_. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any Parent Related Party have the right to seek
or obtain money damages from the Company or any Company Related Party under
this Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) other than the right of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to payment of
the Company Termination Fee or expense reimbursement as set forth in Section
11.04(e) above.

(b) Remedies of the Company.

(i) _Specific Performance (Pre-Closing Covenants)_. Prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 10 and other than as it
relates to the right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger (which are governed by the provisions of Section
11.13(b)(ii)), the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in the courts
described in Section 11.08 and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof.

(ii) _Specific Performance (Closing)_. Prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 10 hereof, the Company shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
remedies to enforce Parents and Merger Subsidiarys obligations to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded 

 



59  and to consummate the Merger only in the event that each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (i) the conditions set forth in Sections 9.01
and 9.02 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing) have been satisfied on the date the Closing should have been
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but for the failure of the
Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any
alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies
the conditions of, Section 7.05) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if the Equity Financing and
Debt Financing are funded, then it would take all such actions that are within
its control to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically
the Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete
the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded (or will not be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing). In no event
shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of
this Agreement other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this Section 11.13.

(iii) _Parent Termination Fee_. The Company shall be entitled to payment of
the Parent Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section 11.04(c)
hereof.

(iv) _Termination_. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Article 10 hereof.

 

(v) _Monetary Damages_. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Related Party have the right
to seek or obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any
Parent Related Party or any Financing Source under this Agreement other than
the right of the Company to payment of the Parent Termination Fee as set forth
in Section 11.04(c). In addition, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each Company
Related Party hereby waive any claims against the Financing Sources and hereby
agree that in no event shall the Financing Sources have any liability or
obligation to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Related
Party relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 11.13 shall in
any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary under the Debt Commitment Letters.

(c) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies __._ Solely to the extent
that the right of specific performance is explicitly applicable under the
terms of this Section 11.13, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such

 



60  provisions. Solely to the extent that the right of specific performance is
explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section 11.13, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in Section 11.08 without proof of
damages or otherwise, and that such explicit rights of specific enforcement
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without such rights, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity to the extent that the right of specific performance is
explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section 11.13. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement (to the extent that the right of
specific performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section
11.13) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.
