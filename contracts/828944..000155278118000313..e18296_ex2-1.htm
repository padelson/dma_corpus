AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of August 7, 2018, by and between WSFS Financial Corporation (" _WSFS_ "), a Delaware corporation, and Beneficial Bancorp, Inc. (" _Beneficial_ "), a Maryland corporation.

  

Preamble

  

 The respective boards of directors of Beneficial and WSFS have approved this Agreement and determined and declared that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and their respective stockholders.

  

 Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ ") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Beneficial will merge with and into WSFS (the " _Merger_ "), with WSFS as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

  

 Concurrently with the Merger, Beneficial Bank, a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Beneficial (" _Beneficial Bank_ "), will merge with and into Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, a federal savings bank and wholly owned subsidiary of WSFS (" _WSFS Bank_ "), with WSFS Bank as the surviving bank, sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Bank_ " (the " _Bank Merger_ ," and together with the Merger, the " _Mergers_ ").

  

 As an inducement for WSFS to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and certain executive officers of Beneficial have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a " _Beneficial Voting Agreement_ "), in the form of _Exhibit A_.

  

 As an inducement for Beneficial to enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and certain executive officers of WSFS have simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (each a " _WSFS Voting Agreement_ " and together with the Beneficial Voting Agreements, the " _Voting Agreements_ "), in the form of _Exhibit B_.

  

 As an inducement for WSFS's willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain employees of Beneficial set forth on _Exhibit C-1_ hereto have simultaneously herewith entered into executive agreements, in form and substance acceptable to WSFS, to be effective upon the Closing (the " _Executive Agreements_ ").

  

 It is the intention of the Parties that the Merger and the Bank Merger for federal income tax purposes shall each qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code for each such Merger.

  

 The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also to prescribe to certain conditions to the Mergers.

ARTICLE 2 
 MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

  

2.1. Conversion of Shares.

  

 Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 2, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of WSFS, Beneficial or the stockholders of any of the foregoing, the shares of the merged corporations shall be converted as follows:

  

 (a) Each share of capital stock of WSFS issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding from and after the Effective Time and shall not be affected by the Merger.

  

 (b) Each share of Beneficial Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by Beneficial, any Beneficial Subsidiary, WSFS or any WSFS Subsidiary (in each case other than shares held in any Employee Benefit Plans or related trust accounts or otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) (collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  

 (c) Each share of Beneficial Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the Canceled Shares) shall be converted into __ the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.3013 of a share (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of WSFS Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) $2.93 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

 (d) Each share of Beneficial Common Stock, when so converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") registered in the transfer books of Beneficial that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Beneficial Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Beneficial Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with ARTICLE 3, including the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 2.5, cash in lieu of fractional shares of WSFS Common Stock into which such shares of Beneficial Common Stock have been converted together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 3.1(d).

  



  

  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

2.2. Anti-Dilution Provisions.

  

 Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and subject to Sections 6.2(d) and 6.2(e), if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding shares of Beneficial Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Beneficial Common Stock or the issued and outstanding shares of WSFS Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of WSFS Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reasons of any reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, reorganization, recapitalization, redenomination, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, then, the Merger Consideration (including the Exchange Ratio) shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect fully the effect of any such change; provided, that nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be considered to permit any Party to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  

2.3. Treatment of Beneficial Equity Awards.

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by Beneficial to purchase shares of Beneficial Common Stock under a Beneficial Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Beneficial Stock Option_ ") shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from WSFS a cash payment equal to the difference, if positive, between $19.50 and the exercise price of the Beneficial Stock Option. Any Beneficial Stock Option with an exercise price that equals or exceeds $19.50 shall be canceled with no consideration being paid to the optionholder with respect to such Beneficial Stock Option. WSFS shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of WSFS to, pay the consideration described in this Section 2.3(a) within five Business Days following the Effective Time.

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Beneficial Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Beneficial Stock Plan that is either outstanding or subject to a restricted stock unit or other Equity Right (other than a Beneficial Stock Option) immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Beneficial Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall fully vest (with any performance-based vesting condition applicable to such Beneficial Restricted Stock Award deemed to have been fully achieved (or achieved at the target level if more than one level of achievement has been contemplated)) and shall be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and treating the shares of Beneficial Common Stock subject to such Beneficial Restricted Stock Award in the same manner as all other shares of Beneficial Common Stock for such purposes. WSFS shall pay or issue the consideration described in this Section 2.3(b), or with respect to the cash portion of such consideration, cause an Affiliate of WSFS to pay, within five Business Days following the Effective Time. WSFS and the Affiliates of WSFS shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Beneficial Restricted Stock Awards all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable Tax Law.

  



  

  

   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

 (c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Beneficial, the board of directors of Beneficial or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.3.

  

2.4. Treatment of Beneficial KSOP.

  

 The right to acquire shares of Beneficial Common Stock under the Beneficial Employee Savings and Stock Ownership Plan (" _Beneficial KSOP_ ") is not a Beneficial Stock Option for purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting Section 7.8(c) hereof, Beneficial shall, effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the " _KSOP Termination Date_ ") and contingent upon the Closing, adopt such necessary resolutions and/or amendments to the Beneficial KSOP to (i) direct the Beneficial KSOP trustee to deliver a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Beneficial Common Stock held in the Beneficial KSOP's suspense account to Beneficial to repay any outstanding exempt loan in the Beneficial KSOP at the Effective Time, (ii) provide for treatment of all remaining shares of Beneficial Common Stock held in the Beneficial KSOP trust in accordance with Section 2.1 hereof, (iii) provide that no new participants shall be admitted to the Beneficial KSOP on or after the KSOP Termination Date and (iv) fully vest all participant KSOP accounts as of the KSOP Termination Date. The assets credited to the employee stock ownership plan portion of the Beneficial KSOP following the repayment of all exempt loans in the Beneficial KSOP shall be allocated as earnings to the accounts of eligible Beneficial KSOP participants who are employed as of the KSOP Termination Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be subject to the prior review and written approval of WSFS, and Beneficial shall deliver to WSFS an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable following their adoption by the board of directors of Beneficial and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments.

  

2.5. Fractional Shares.

  

 No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of WSFS Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of WSFS shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of WSFS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Beneficial Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of WSFS Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment, rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest), which payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of WSFS Common Stock that such holder of shares of Beneficial Common Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c) by (ii) the Average Closing Price.

  

ARTICLE 3 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  

3.1. Exchange Procedures.

  

 (a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time, WSFS shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to Beneficial (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Beneficial Common Stock (excluding the Canceled Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Holders_ "), for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i) certificates or, at WSFS's option, evidence of WSFS Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (collectively referred to as " _WSFS Certificates_ ") for shares of WSFS Common Stock equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration and (ii) immediately available funds for (A) the aggregate Cash Consideration and (B) any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5, to the extent then determinable (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by WSFS, provided, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration and other amounts payable to the Holders. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to WSFS. WSFS shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, in accordance with this Agreement.

---|---|--- 

 



    

 (b) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than seven days following the Effective Time, WSFS shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share notice advising such Holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon (i) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, proper delivery of the Certificates and the transmittal materials, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, to the Exchange Agent (and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and (ii) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, proper delivery of an "agent's message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence (if any) of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with the appropriate transmittal materials, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the Holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Stock Consideration in non-certificated book-entry form and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the Cash Consideration, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares (which such Holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5) and (C) any dividends or distributions which the Holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(d), in each case which such Holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE 3, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of Holders on the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

 (c) _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share transfer books of Beneficial shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Beneficial Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Holders who held shares of Beneficial Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein.

Each Beneficial Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has received a favorable determination letter, or for a prototype plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and applies to the Beneficial Benefit Plan and on which such Beneficial Benefit Plan is entitled to rely.

Within the past three years, no Beneficial Entity has taken any action to take material corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, DOL or any other Regulatory Authority with respect to any Beneficial Benefit Plan. All assets of each Beneficial Benefit Plan that is a retirement plan consist exclusively of cash and actively traded securities.

No Tax under Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any Beneficial Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could give rise to such Tax.

  

 (g) Section 4.17(g) of Beneficial's Disclosure Memorandum has a complete and accurate list of all Beneficial Benefit Plans that are subject to Title IV of ERISA (each a " _Beneficial Pension Plan_ "). Beneficial has made available to WSFS a true and complete copy of the most recently available actuarial valuation and the most recent statement of assets for each Beneficial Pension Plan. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in ERISA 302 of and Internal Revenue Code Section 412), whether or not waived, exists with respect to any Beneficial Pension Plan. Beneficial has made adequate provisions for reserves to meet contributions that have not been made yet because they are not yet due. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate current value of all vested accrued benefits (based on actuarial assumptions that have been furnished to WSFS) under all Beneficial Pension Plans did not exceed the aggregate current value of all assets of such Beneficial Pension Plans allocable to such vested accrued benefits. No "reportable event" (as described in ERISA Section 4043(c) and the regulations thereunder, and determined without regard to whether the PBGC has waived the requirement to report the occurrence of such event) has occurred with respect to any Beneficial Pension Plan. Since December 31, 2017, there has been (1) no material adverse change in the financial condition of any Beneficial Pension Plan, (2) no change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any Beneficial Pension Plan, and (3) no increase in benefits under any Beneficial Pension Plan as a result of plan amendments, change in applicable Law or otherwise, which individually or in the aggregate would increase the amount of such excess. No Beneficial Pension Plan is subject to, or has ever been subject to, the funding based restrictions in Internal Revenue Code Section 436(d).

  



  

 (h) All contributions required to be made to any Beneficial Benefit Plan by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Beneficial Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the Books and Records of Beneficial.

 (i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of any Beneficial Entity, or result in any (i) requirement to fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi trust), (ii) limitation on the right of any Beneficial Entity to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Beneficial Benefit Plan or related trust, (iii) acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such payment, right, compensation or benefit, or (iv) entitlement by any recipient of any payment or benefit to receive a "gross up" payment for any income or other Taxes that might be owed with respect to such payment or benefit.

Section 4.17(i) of Beneficial's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth accurate and complete data with respect to each individual who has a contractual right to severance pay or benefits (or increase in severance pay or benefits, including the acceleration of any payment or vesting) triggered by a change in control and the amounts potentially payable to each such individual in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) or as a result of a termination of employment or service, taking into account any contractual provisions relating to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. No Beneficial Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 or 409A, or otherwise.

  

 (j) The Beneficial KSOP is the only Beneficial Benefit Plan that includes an employee stock ownership plan provision within the meaning of ERISA Section 407(d)(6)(A)).

The terms, provisions, use of the proceeds and repayment of any loan to the Beneficial KSOP satisfied in all respects the applicable requirements for an "exempt loan" within the meaning of Section 4975(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. Section 4.17(j) of Beneficial's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth as of the date hereof the balance and other principal terms for any "exempt loan" within the meaning of Section 4975(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder.

 (iv) the board of directors of Beneficial has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or modifications proposed to by WSFS, if any, that such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Change in the Beneficial Recommendation would be a violation of the director's fiduciary duties under applicable Law and, in which event, the board of directors of Beneficial may communicate the basis for its lack of Beneficial Recommendation to its stockholders in the Joint Proxy/Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law; provided, that the resolution approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended.

determination and notice period as referred to in this Section 7.2(d).

Certain Matters.

  

 (a) Beneficial and WSFS shall each promptly advise the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would or would reasonably be likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE 8; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 7.5(a) or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.2 or 8.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the Party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 or 8.3 to be satisfied.

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Beneficial and WSFS shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the Representatives of the other Party, access during normal business hours to its books, records, Contracts, properties and personnel and such other information as the other Party may reasonably request and furnish to the other Party promptly all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request, provided, that such access or requests shall not unreasonably interfere with normal operations of the Party. No investigation by either Party shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to such Party's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Beneficial nor WSFS nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Beneficial's or WSFS's, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty or binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 Beneficial and WSFS shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public disclosure or communication (including communications to employees, agents and contractors) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue such press release or other public disclosure without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any press release or other public disclosure as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the Party required to make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof. The Parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the execution of this Agreement.

  

7.7. Tax Treatment.

  

 (a) Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger and the Bank Merger, and to take no action which would cause the Merger and the Bank Merger not, to each qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for federal income tax purposes. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Internal Revenue Code.

  

 (b) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their appropriate officers to execute and deliver to Covington and Burling LLP, certificates containing appropriate representations and covenants, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to such counsel, at such time or times as may reasonably be requested by such counsel, including as of the effective date of the Joint Proxy/Prospectus and the Closing Date, in connection with such counsel's deliveries of opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the Merger and the Bank Merger.

  

 (c) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of WSFS and Beneficial shall report the Merger and the Bank Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

  

7.8. Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  

 (a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by this Agreement, WSFS shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to employees who are actively employed by a Beneficial Entity on the Closing Date (" _Covered Employees_ ") while employed by WSFS following the Closing Date (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than either the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, provided to the Covered Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date or, in WSFS's sole discretion, the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, provided by WSFS and its Subsidiaries to their similarly situated employees, (ii) target cash bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than the target cash bonus opportunities that are made available to the Covered Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date or, in WSFS's sole discretion, that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of WSFS and its Subsidiaries and (iii) employee benefits under WSFS Benefit Plans, on terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to those provided by WSFS Entities to their similarly situated employees; provided, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of any WSFS Entity. Until such time as WSFS shall cause the Covered Employees to participate in the applicable WSFS Benefit Plans, the continued participation of the Covered Employees in the Beneficial Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this clause (it being understood that participation in WSFS Benefit Plans may commence at different times with respect to each of WSFS Benefit Plans). For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under WSFS Benefit Plans, and for purposes of determining a Covered Employee's entitlement to paid time off under WSFS's paid time off program, the service of the Covered Employees with a Beneficial Entity prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with a WSFS Entity participating in such WSFS Benefit Plans, to the same extent that such service was recognized by the Beneficial Entities for purposes of a similar benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly-situated employees of WSFS Entities do not receive credit for prior service, (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or (z) for purposes of retiree medical benefits or level of benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, without limiting the generality of Section 7.8(a), with respect to each Covered Employee (and their beneficiaries) WSFS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each life, disability, medical, dental or health plan of WSFS or its Subsidiaries in which each such Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate (to the extent permitted by the applicable carrier) to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions were covered under the applicable life, disability, medical, dental or health plans of the Beneficial Entities, (ii) provide credit under medical, dental and health plans for any deductibles, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Covered Employees (and their beneficiaries) under analogous plans of the Beneficial Entities prior to the Effective Time during the portion of the applicable plan year prior to participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation, actively-at-work requirement or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to such Covered Employees and their beneficiaries on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee or beneficiary had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time.

  

 (c) Upon request by WSFS in writing no later than 45 days prior to the Closing Date, the Beneficial Entities shall cooperate in good faith with WSFS prior to the Closing Date to provide additional information regarding any Beneficial Benefit Plan to WSFS or participation therein and to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any Beneficial Benefit Plan to the extent and in the manner determined by WSFS effective upon the Closing Date (or at such different time mutually agreed to by the Parties) and consistent with applicable Law. Beneficial shall provide WSFS with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 7.8(c), as applicable, and give Beneficial a reasonable opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, Beneficial shall provide WSFS with the final documentation evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been effectuated.

  

 (d) Without limiting the generality of Section 10.4, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Beneficial or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any Beneficial Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by WSFS, Beneficial or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Surviving Corporation, WSFS or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Beneficial Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date, or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Beneficial or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any right to employment or continued employment or continued service with WSFS or any WSFS Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or the Beneficial Entities, or constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee, or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Beneficial, WSFS or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Beneficial or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

 (i) WSFS shall assume the Severance Pay Plan for Eligible Employees of Beneficial Bank as in effect on the date hereof (the " _Beneficial Severance Plan_ ") and shall provide to Covered Employees whose employment is terminated without cause by WSFS, the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate on or before December 31, 2019, to the extent otherwise eligible under the Beneficial Severance Plan, the benefits provided therein, subject to the terms and conditions thereof.

  

 (j) WSFS shall provide Covered Employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated by WSFS other than for cause prior to December 31, 2019, and who so requests, job counseling and outplacement assistance services, consistent with industry standards and the job counseling and outplacement assistance services provided by WSFS and its Subsidiaries to their similarly situated employees. In addition, WSFS shall notify Covered Employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated by WSFS other than for cause prior to December 31, 2019, who want to be so notified of opportunities for positions with WSFS or any of its Subsidiaries for which WSFS reasonably believes such persons are qualified and shall consider any application for such positions submitted by such persons; provided, however, that any decision to offer employment to any such person shall be made in the sole discretion of WSFS. Outplacement assistance and job counseling services shall not be provided to Beneficial employees who are terminated for cause, resignation, disability or retirement.

  

7.9. Indemnification.

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, each of WSFS and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of the Beneficial Entities (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgements, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of any of the Beneficial Entities or, at Beneficial's request, of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a " _Claim_ "), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and WSFS or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided, that the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification).

  



  

  

   

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

 (b) WSFS shall maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time Beneficial's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (provided, that WSFS may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous to the insured or (ii) with the consent of Beneficial given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with respect to Claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the Effective Time; provided, that WSFS shall not be obligated to make aggregate premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion related to Beneficial's directors and officers, 275% of the annual premium payments currently paid on Beneficial's current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, WSFS shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, WSFS, or Beneficial in consultation with WSFS, may obtain on or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.9(b) at a premium not to exceed the Maximum Amount. If the premium necessary to purchase such "tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, WSFS, or Beneficial in consultation with WSFS, may purchase the most advantageous "tail" prepaid policy obtainable for a premium less than or equal to the Maximum Amount, and in each case, WSFS shall have no further obligations under this Section 7.9(b) other than to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy.

  

 (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 7.9(a), upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify WSFS thereof (but the failure to so notify WSFS shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this Section 7.9, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices WSFS). In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) WSFS or Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and, upon such assumption, WSFS and Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof (except that if WSFS elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for the Indemnified Party reasonably advises the Indemnified Party that there are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues that raise conflicts of interest between WSFS and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to WSFS, and WSFS shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel), (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) WSFS and Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided, further, that WSFS and Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

 (d) If WSFS or any successors or assigns shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or if WSFS (or any successors or assigns) shall transfer all or substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of WSFS shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and business operations generally (including by entering into customary confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service providers or the other Party). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other Party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

 Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Beneficial and WSFS shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Mergers and, subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any Consent or Order by any Regulatory Authority and any other third party that is required to be obtained by Beneficial or WSFS or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with, or to effect, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including, any merger between a Subsidiary of WSFS, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of Beneficial, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Bank with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the Parties to the Mergers, the proper officers and directors of each Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may reasonably be requested by WSFS.

 WSFS may at any time change the method of effecting the combination of the Beneficial and WSFS (including by providing for the merger of Beneficial with a wholly owned Subsidiary of WSFS) if and to the extent requested by WSFS, and Beneficial agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as WSFS may reasonably request in order to give effect to such restructuring; provided, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect to Beneficial's stockholders, or (iii) materially delay or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 If either Beneficial or WSFS shall have failed to obtain the Beneficial Stockholder Approval or the WSFS Stockholder Approval, as applicable, at the duly convened Beneficial Meeting or WSFS Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, each of the Parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither Party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in a manner adverse to such Party or its stockholders or adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Mergers with respect to the Beneficial's stockholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 7.15) to its respective stockholders for approval.

  

7.16. Corporate Governance.

  

 (a) On or prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of WSFS and WSFS Bank shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full board of directors of each of the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Bank at the Effective Time to be increased by three members, and as of the Effective Time shall appoint Gerald P.

The Advisory Board shall meet on a quarterly basis (or more frequently if necessary) from and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2019 and each member of the Advisory Board (other than Rodger Levenson and Gerard P. Cuddy) shall be paid a retainer fee of $50,000.

If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of WSFS and Beneficial will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 Beneficial and WSFS agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and directors of Beneficial subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Beneficial Insiders_ "), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Beneficial Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares of Beneficial Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 7.18. The boards of directors of WSFS and of Beneficial, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Beneficial Common Stock and (ii) any acquisitions of WSFS Common Stock pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by any Beneficial Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded to the nearest one
one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and
the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the WSFS Ratio. If WSFS so
elects within such five Business Day period, it shall give prompt written
notice to Beneficial of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(i)
and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except

The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Sections 10.3(b) and 10.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Beneficial or WSFS, as applicable, fails to pay any fee payable by it pursuant to this Section 10.3 when due, then Beneficial or WSFS, as applicable, shall pay to WSFS or Beneficial, as applicable, its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such payment was due under this Agreement until the date of payment.

Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to comply with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition.

  

10.7. Assignment.

  

 Except as expressly contemplated hereby, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Party.
