corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings set forth in _Article 11_ below.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Company operates two businesses, a filtration business (the "
_Business_ ") and a non-filtration business (the " _Non-Filter Business_ ");

 

WHEREAS, following the consummation of all of the actions and activities
described on _Annex A_ (collectively, the " _Restructuring_ "), (i) Holdings
and FilterCo will own and operate the Business and FilterCo will be a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Holdings, and (ii) Seller will own 100% of the issued and
outstanding equity interests on a fully-diluted basis of Holdings (the "
_Closing Shares_ "); and

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller desires to sell to Buyer (or such Affiliate
as Buyer may designate in accordance with _Section 12.05_ by providing
written notice to Seller), and Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof in
accordance with _Section 12.05_) desires to purchase from Seller, all of the
Closing Shares in exchange for the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto each agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

_PURCHASE AND SALE OF CLOSING SHARES_

1.01. _The Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Closing
Shares (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray
LLP, located at Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston, Massachusetts,
on the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in _Article 2_ (other than those conditions which by
their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, which shall be satisfied
on the Closing Date) or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer
and Seller. The date of the Closing is herein referred to as the " _Closing
Date_."

1.02. _Purchase and Sale of Closing Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, Seller
or its Affiliates shall cause the steps of the Restructuring to occur, at the
conclusion of which, Seller will sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer,
and Buyer will purchase and acquire from Seller, all of the Closing Shares,
free and clear of all Liens, in exchange for the payment of cash as set forth
below.

 



-1- 1.03. _Calculation of Closing and Final Consideration_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Aggregate Closing Consideration_ "
means an amount equal to:

 

(i) $325,000,000,

 

(ii) _plus_ the total amount of Cash on Hand,

 

(iii) _minus_ the unpaid Sellers Transaction Expenses as of immediately prior
to the Closing,

 

(iv) _minus_ unpaid Indebtedness of any Acquired Company,

 

(v) _plus_ the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the
Net Working Capital Target, and

 

(vi) _minus_ the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
the Net Working Capital Target.

 

(b) Attached hereto as _Annex B_ is a statement of Net Working Capital as of
March 31, 2014 (the " _March Working Capital Statement_ "), setting forth the
calculation of Net Working Capital as of such date (the " _March Net Working
Capital_ "), which was prepared by the Company in good faith in accordance
with the definition of Net Working Capital and the accounting principles and
practices referred to on _Annex B_. At least one business day prior to the
Closing Date, the Company will deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of the
Aggregate Closing Consideration (the " _Estimated Aggregate Closing
Consideration_ ") and each component thereof. The Estimated Closing Statement
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the definitions of the terms
Cash on Hand and Sellers Transaction Expenses and the _Agreed Accounting
Principles_. Following delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement, the
Company will (i) reasonably promptly upon the request by Buyer, provide Buyer
and its representatives with reasonable access to the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents) and
supporting data for purposes of their review of the Estimated Closing
Statement, and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Buyer and its representatives
in connection with such review, including promptly providing any other
information reasonably necessary or useful in connection with the review of
the Estimated Closing Statement (including all components thereof) as is
reasonably requested by Buyer or its representatives. Prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer may notify the Company of any objections to the Estimated Closing
Statement. The Company shall reasonably consider in good faith, but shall not
be obligated to accept, any such objections made by Buyer. The failure of the
Company to include any changes proposed by Buyer, or the acceptance by Buyer
of the Estimated Closing Statement, shall not limit or otherwise affect
Buyers rights or remedies under this Agreement, including Buyers right to
include such changes or other changes in the Closing Statement or constitute
an acknowledgement by Buyer of the accuracy of the Estimated Closing
Statement. 

 



-2- (c) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will deliver to Seller (i) an unaudited statement of Net Working
Capital as of the Closing (ii) its calculation of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration and each component thereof (together, the " _Closing Statement_
"), and (iii) in the event that Buyer, utilizing the Agreed Accounting
Principles, has identified any manifest error(s) in the calculation of
components of Net Working Capital reflected in the March Working Capital
Statement (a) a revised unaudited statement of Net Working Capital as of
March 31, 2013 (the " _Revised March Working Capital Statement_ "), and (b) a
revised calculation of the Net Working Capital Target derived from the Revised
March Working Capital Statement. The Closing Statement and (if applicable)
the Revised March Working Capital Statement will be prepared in a manner
consistent with the definitions of the terms Cash on Hand, Sellers
Transaction Expenses and Net Working Capital and the Agreed Accounting
Principles. The Closing Statement and (if applicable) the Revised March
Working Capital Statement will entirely disregard (i) any and all effects on
the Acquired Companies (including the assets and liabilities of the Acquired
Companies) as a result of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered
into at any time by Buyer or any other transaction entered into by Buyer in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) any of the plans, transactions, fundings, payments or changes that
Buyer initiates or makes or causes to be initiated or made after the Closing
with respect to the Acquired Companies or their business or assets, or any
facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any of its
assets or liabilities.

(d) Buyer will, and will cause the Acquired Companies to, (i) promptly
provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data and employees of the Acquired
Companies who were involved in the preparation of the Closing Statement and
(if applicable) the Revised March Working Capital Statement) for purposes of
Sellers review of the Closing Statement and (if applicable) the Revised
March Working Capital Statement, and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Seller
and its representatives in connection with such review, including promptly
providing any other information reasonably necessary or useful in connection
with the review of the Closing Statement (including all components thereof)
and (if applicable) the Revised March Working Capital Statement (including all
components thereof) as is reasonably requested by Seller or its
representatives. If Seller has any objections to the Closing Statement and/or
(if applicable) the Revised March Working Capital Statement, Seller will
deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "
_Objections Statement_ "), which statement will identify in reasonable detail
those items and amounts to which Seller objects (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If
an Objections Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 50 days after
delivery of the Closing Statement and/or (if applicable) the Revised March
Working Capital Statement, the Closing Statement and/or the Revised March
Working Capital Statement, as applicable, as prepared by Buyer will be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties. Seller and Buyer will negotiate in
good faith to resolve the Disputed Items and all such discussions will
(unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed by Rule 408 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule, but if they
do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the
Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer will submit any unresolved
Disputed Items to an independent national accounting firm mutually selected by
Buyer and Seller (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). In the event the parties submit
any unresolved Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party will submit a
Closing Statement and/or Revised March Working Capital Statement, as
applicable (which in the case of each party may be a Closing Statement and/or
Revised March Working Capital Statement, as applicable, that, with respect to
the unresolved Disputed Items

 



-3-  (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is
different than the Closing Statement and/or Revised March Working Capital
Statement, as applicable, initially submitted to Seller, or the Objections
Statement delivered to Buyer, as applicable) together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Accounting Firm within 30 days
after the date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the
Accounting Firm for resolution. The Accounting Firm will resolve such dispute
by choosing, in its entirety, the Closing Statement and/or the Revised March
Working Capital Statement, as applicable, proposed by either Seller or
Buyer, and will make no other resolution of such dispute (including by
combining elements of the Closing Statements and/or the Revised March Working
Capital Statement, as applicable, submitted by both parties). Seller and Buyer
will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any
event within 30 days after the date on which the Accounting Firm receives the
Closing Statements and/or Revised March Working Capital Statement, as
applicable, prepared by Seller and Buyer. The Closing Statement and/or Revised
March Working Capital Statement, as applicable, selected by the Accounting
Firm will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties. Each
party will bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution
of such dispute by the Accounting Firm. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm will be paid by the party whose Closing Statement is not
chosen by the Accounting Firm in its resolution of the dispute (or, if the
dispute involves both the Closing Statement and the Revised March Working
Capital Statement and the Accounting Firm chooses the Revised March Working
Capital Statement proposed by one party and the Closing Statement proposed by
the other party, the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid
50% by each party).

(e) If the Aggregate Closing Consideration as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 1.03(d)_ (the " _Final Aggregate Closing Consideration_ ") is
greater than the Estimated Aggregate Closing Consideration, then, within five
business days after the determination of the Final Aggregate Closing
Consideration, Buyer will pay to the account specified by Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to such excess.

 

(f) If the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Closing Consideration, then, within five business days after the
determination of the Final Aggregate Closing Consideration, Seller will pay to
the account specified by Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to such difference.

 

(g) All payments required pursuant to _Sections 1.03(e)_ and _1.03(f)_ will be
deemed to be adjustments for Tax purposes to the aggregate purchase price
paid by Buyer for the Closing Shares purchased by it pursuant to this
Agreement except as otherwise required by Law.

 

(h) Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (including the
Aggregate Closing Consideration) such Taxes as it may be required to deduct
and withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax laws. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid. Buyer shall notify Seller at least two (2) business
days prior to such withholding and will provide Seller with the opportunity
to discuss such withholding with Buyer.

 



-4- 1.04. _Closing Deliverables and Payments_.

 

(a) _Seller s Closing Deliverables_. At the Closing, the Seller shall deliver
or cause to be delivered the following to Buyer:

 

(i) a stock certificate representing the Closing Shares, accompanied by a
duly-executed stock power in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer;

(ii) a certificate of Seller executed by a duly authorized officer thereof,
dated as of the Closing Date, stating that the conditions specified in
_Sections 2.02(a)_ , _2.02(b)_ , _2.02(c)_ and _2.02(d)_ have been satisfied
(the " _Seller Closing Certificate_ ");

 

(iii) a copy of the Transition Services Agreement, duly executed by the
Company and FilterCo;

 

(iv) a copy of the Intellectual Property License Agreement, duly executed by
the Company and FilterCo; and

 

(v) a copy of the Real Property Deed, duly executed by the Company and
FilterCo;

 

(vi) a copy of the Employee Services Agreement, signed by the Company;

 

(vii) certificate(s) of the Secretary or other authorized officer of Seller,
the Company and the Acquired Companies certifying and attaching copies of the
resolutions duly adopted by Sellers, Holdings and each Acquired Companys
board of directors (or equivalent governing body) authorizing the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby to the extent a party hereto or thereto, and the
consummation of all transactions (including the Restructuring) contemplated

Stanadyne Amalgamations Private Limited to terminate all licenses and rights
granted thereunder with respect to Business-Owned Intellectual Property.

 

6.14. _Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation_.

 

(a) As an inducement for Buyer to enter into this and as additional
consideration for the payment of Aggregate Closing Consideration to be paid
by Buyer under this Agreement, the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not,
directly or indirectly:

(i) during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Covenant Period_ "), engage
in the business of (1) formulating, manufacturing, bottling, distributing or
selling any Class

 



-36-  1 or 4 Additive Products; (2) designing, testing, manufacturing or
distributing fuel filters (including of the type included in the Fuel Manager
line of products) used on diesel engine applications; or (3) purchasing such
fuel filters for distribution (collectively, the " _Covered Business_ "), or
invest in, own, manage, operate or control, any Person engaged in any Covered
Business, in any such case anywhere within the world (it being acknowledged
by the parties that the Business sells such products globally); _provided_ ,
_however_ that (w) this _Section 6.14(a)(i)_ shall not prohibit Seller and
its Subsidiaries from testing or purchasing and distributing products of
Buyer and its Affiliates, (x) this _Section 6.14(a)(i)_ shall not prohibit
Seller and its Subsidiaries from testing such fuel filters for use with pump
products made by Seller or its Subsidiaries (y) subsection (3) of this
_Section 6.14(a)(i)_ shall not prohibit Seller and its Subsidiaries from
purchasing and distributing such fuel filters to the extent they are specified
by an original equipment manufacturer customer as part of an integrated fuel
system after Seller has used good faith efforts to have such original
equipment manufacturer customer specify a filter product of the Business and
(z) beneficial ownership of less than three percent (3%) of any class of
equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 will not be deemed to be in violation of this _Section
6.14(a)(i)_; or

 

(ii) during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third
anniversary thereof, induce or attempt to induce any Affected Employee to
leave the employ of Buyer or its Affiliates, in any way interfere with the
relationship between Buyer and its Affiliates and any Affected Employee, or
solicit, offer employment to, otherwise attempt to hire, hire, or otherwise
engage as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, any such Affected
Employee; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict (x) general
solicitations of employment through advertisements or other means that are
not directed specifically at such employees or (y) the hiring of any Person
whose employment is terminated by an Acquired Company or any of its
Affiliates; _provided_ , that in the event of a hiring contemplated by (y),
Seller and its Subsidiaries have not breached the terms of this _Section
6.14(a)(ii)_ with respect to such Person and; _provided_ , _further_ , that in
no event shall Seller and its Subsidiaries hire or otherwise engage as an
employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, any Key Employee during the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary
thereof.

 

(b) Seller and the Company acknowledge that all of the foregoing provisions,
including the restrictions on time and geographical scope set forth in this
_Section 6.14_, are reasonable and necessary to protect Buyer from unfair
competition and solicitation. If any of the covenants set forth in this
_Section 6.14_ are held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of
such covenants shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect,
without regard to the invalid portions. If it is determined that any of the
restrictive covenants, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the
duration of such provision, the geographical area covered thereby, or any
other determination of unreasonableness of the provision, the court making
such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration, area or scope
of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be
enforceable and shall be enforced.

6.15. _Cycle Counts_. Until the Companys delivery to the Buyer of the
Estimated Closing Statement in accordance with _Section 1.03(b)_ or the
earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ hereof, the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable 

 



-37-  efforts to perform cycle counts, in an amount and frequency and of a kind
reasonably determined by the Company, in order to accurately identify the
inventory and the value of such inventory for purposes of determining the
Estimated Net Working Capital, to the extent reasonably practicable, in the
Estimated Closing Statement. Within three business days prior to the Closing
Date (and following at least two days advance notice to Seller), Buyer shall
have the right to conduct test counts of inventory in a manner reasonably
determined by Buyer in order to verify the inventory for purposes of
evaluating the Estimated Net Working Capital.

 

6.16. _Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall timely comply with all Laws and Orders
applicable to the Pending Response Action, including Laws arising under North
Carolinas Inactive Hazardous Sites program (the " _IHS Program_ ").

(b) If NCDENR formally requests that Seller (or a Subsidiary thereof) enter
into an agreement requiring Seller (or a Subsidiary thereof) to investigate or
remediate the Pending Response Action (such agreement, an " _Administrative
Agreement_ "), Seller and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall enter into
such Administrative Agreement, unless, after direct consultation with Buyer,
Seller reasonably and in good faith concludes not to do so, and provided
further that the foregoing shall be without prejudice to Sellers right to
negotiate reasonable terms in the Administrative Agreement. Upon entering into
an Administrative Agreement, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall comply with the
terms thereof, subject to Sellers right to challenge or contest, in good
faith, any decision or action made or taken by NCDENR in the administration of
the Administrative Agreement, of the IHS Program, or of related Laws and
Orders. The Parties acknowledge that the Administrative Agreement could
provide for direct oversight of the Pending Response Action by the IHS
Program, or for the Pending Response Action to be overseen privately by a
Registered Environmental Consultant (" _REC_ ") pursuant to NCDENRs
environmental consultant-directed assessment and remedial action program as
implemented pursuant to N.C.G.S. 130A-310.9(c) and 15 NCAC 13C.0300 (the "
_REC Program_ ").

 

(c) If Seller and its Subsidiaries do not comply with their respective
obligations under _Sections 6.16(a)_ or _(b)_ , then, after written notice
from Buyer to Seller explaining the alleged acts of noncompliance in
reasonable detail, and after a reasonable opportunity for Seller to cure such
alleged acts of noncompliance, Buyer shall have the right to perform such
obligations, and the Seller Entities shall be liable for, and shall reimburse
Buyer for, all Losses reasonably incurred by Buyer related thereto.

(d) Seller and its Subsidiaries will promptly deliver to Buyer all material
documents and correspondence received from NCDENR or any other Governmental
Body relating to the Pending Response Action.

 

(e) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall produce to Buyer, for Buyers review and
comment, prior to submission to any Governmental Body, all material
correspondence, reports or other documents in connection with the Pending
Response Action (such documents, " _Project Deliverables_ "), and will deliver
to Buyer copies of all Project Deliverables. Seller and its Subsidiaries will
produce these documents to Buyer so that Buyer shall have a reasonable amount
of time to review and comment on such documents prior to submission to the
Governmental Body.

 



-38- (f) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably consult with Buyer prior to
proposing or agreeing to any investigation and remediation plans with respect
to the Pending Response Action. Without Buyers prior written consent, neither
Seller nor any its Subsidiaries shall agree to, propose or implement any
investigation or remediation plan that would unreasonably interfere with
Business operations or materially reduce the value of the Owned Real Property,
unless and to the extent that Seller or its Subsidiaries are mandated to take
such action by a Governmental Body (or REC, if the Pending Response Action is
subject to the REC Program) and no reasonable alternative exists. Except as
otherwise required by Law, in no event shall Seller and its Subsidiaries be
required to propose or perform remedial actions beyond those necessary to
support the continued use of the Owned Real Property for commercial and
industrial purposes consistent with its use as of the Closing Date. To the
extent consistent with applicable Laws, Seller may utilize institutional
controls in connection with such remedial actions, to the extent such
institutional controls do not unreasonably interfere with Business operations
or materially reduce the value of the Owned Real Property. If reasonably
proposed by Seller, Buyer shall cooperate as reasonably necessary in the
implementation of any such institutional controls.

(g) Except to the extent it unreasonably interferes with Business operations,
and upon reasonable notice to Buyer, in order to facilitate Sellers
compliance with this _Section 6.16_, Buyer shall allow Seller and its
consultants and contractors to enter the Owned Real Property for the purpose
of conducting any investigations or remedial actions required in connection
with Sellers performance of the Pending Response Action. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall consent to such entrance to the extent so mandated by
a Governmental Body. Seller shall be solely responsible for the conduct and
safety of such consultants and contractors while on the Owned Real Property or
otherwise while performing their respective services, and Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and all of their
respective owners, directors, officers, employees and agents from any acts or
omissions of such consultants and contractors while on the Owned Real Property
or otherwise performing their respective services. In all agreements whereby
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries retains contractors to perform any aspect of
the Pending Response Action, Seller or such Subsidiary, as applicable, shall
cause Buyer to be (i) a third party beneficiary with respect to indemnity or
defense rights against the contractor, and (ii) named as an additional insured
under all of contractors liability insurance policies, except for workers
compensation and professional liability, in each case at the sole cost and
expenses of Buyer.

(h) Except as provided in clauses (i) through (iii) of this  _Section
6.16(h)_, as between Seller and Buyer, Seller and Sellers REC shall have
exclusive authority and control over all communications and agreements with
NCDENR and other Governmental Bodies with respect to the conduct and scope of
the Pending Response Action. Except (i) where required by Law (and in such
case, Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonable advance notice of any such
communication and give Seller the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon any such communication), or (ii) in connection with Buyers performance
of Sellers obligations in accordance with _Section 6.16(c)_, Buyer and
persons related with Buyer (including Buyers employees, Contract
Employees, consultants, agents, officers, directors or affiliates ("
_Related_

 



-39-   _Persons_ ") shall not initiate or make any communications with NCDENR or
any other Governmental Body, or any other third party (including Sellers REC,
consultants or agents) with respect to the conduct or scope of the Pending
Response Action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
6.16(h)_ shall prohibit or restrict Buyer or any of its Related Persons from
truthfully relating to any Person any information about the transactions
under this Agreement and the terms hereof and the agreements and respective
covenants and obligations of the Parties hereunder for bona fide purposes,
including that (A) Buyer is an entity distinct from Seller or any previous
owner or operator of the Owned Real Property; (B) that prior to Closing, Buyer
had neither owned nor operated the Owned Real Property; and (C) that Seller
and its Subsidiaries have obligations relating to the Pending Response
Action, and in any such event, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of any such
disclosures.

ARTICLE 7

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF BUYER_

 

7.01. _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer will not, and will not
permit the Acquired Companies to, amend, repeal or modify any provision
existing as of the date of this Agreement in any Acquired Companies
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent governing
documents relating to the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of
expenses of the current and former officers and directors of any Acquired
Company (each, a " _D andO Indemnified Person_") (unless required by Law), it
being the intent of the parties that each DandO Indemnified Person will continue
to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses in accordance with such provisions to the full extent of the Law.

 

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 7.01_ and
not in limitation thereof, for a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer
will, and will cause the Acquired Companies (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying
Party_") to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify
and hold harmless the DandO Indemnified Persons against all DandO Expenses (as
defined below), losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (" _D andO Costs_") in respect of any threatened, pending or
completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil,
administrative or investigative, based on or arising out or relating to the
fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of any Acquired Company
arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing (including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby) (a " _D andO Indemnifiable
Claim_") and (ii) advance to such DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO
Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including
in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of
such claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification and; _provided_
, _further_ that neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company will be liable for
any settlement effected without its express written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If prior to the date that
is six years after the Closing, a DandO

 



-40-  Indemnified Person delivers to Buyer a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 7.01(b)_, then any DandO Indemnifiable
Claim asserted in such notice will continue until such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim is waived in writing by such DandO Indemnified Person or such DandO
Indemnifiable Claim is fully and finally resolved. For the purposes of this
_Section 7.01(b)_, " _D andO Expenses_" will include reasonable attorneys
fees and all other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection
with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in
(including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or
participate in any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but will exclude losses, judgments
and amounts paid in settlement (which items are included in the definition of
DandO Costs).

 

(c) At the Closing, Seller will, or will cause the Acquired Companies to (at
Sellers expense), obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail"
insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries
with a claims period of six years from the Closing Date from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as Holdings and the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors liability insurance in an
amount and scope at least as favorable as Holdings and the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer will not, or will cause the Acquired Companies to not,
cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect.

 

(d) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of any Acquired
Company are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions,
then Buyer and the Acquired Company will, in each such case, ensure that the
successors and assigns of the Acquired Company assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.01_. The provisions of this  _Section 7.01(d)_
will apply to all of the successors and assigns of the Acquired Companies.

7.02. _Regulatory Filings_. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve as soon as practicable objections, if any, asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereunder. To the extent permitted by applicable Laws, Buyer
shall promptly notify Seller of any communication it or any of its Affiliates
receives from any Governmental Body relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement and permit Seller to review in advance any
proposed communication by Buyer to any such Governmental Body. Buyer shall
not agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Body in respect
of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with Seller
in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives
Seller the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to
_Section 10.04(b)_ and _(c)_ and applicable Laws, Buyer shall provide Seller
with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between Buyer or
Buyers Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Body or members
of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to _Section 10.04(b)_
and _(c)_ and applicable Laws, Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate fully and
promptly with Seller in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as Seller may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

7.03. _Conditions_. Without limiting any covenant contained in this Agreement,
which obligations shall control to the extent of any conflict with the
succeeding provisions of this _Section 7.03_, Buyer shall: (i) assemble,
prepare and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such
information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as

 



-41-  practicable all governmental and regulatory consents required to be obtained
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents and approvals of third parties that Buyer or its Affiliates may be
required to obtain in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and (iii) take such other action as
may reasonably be necessary or as Seller may reasonable request to satisfy the
conditions of _Sections 2.01_ and _2.03_ to Sellers obligations or otherwise
to comply with this Agreement and (subject to the provisions of _Section
1.01_) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
practicable.

7.04.  _Contact with Clients and Suppliers_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 6.02_, prior to the Closing, Buyer and Buyers Representatives will
contact and communicate with the employees, clients, suppliers and other
business relations of the Business in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby only with the prior written consent of Seller (which may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

7.05. _Employees_.

(a) As of (i) with respect to the U.S. Affected Employees, the Deferred U.S.
Transfer Date, (ii) with respect to the OUS Affected Employees, the Deferred
European Transfer Date and (iii) with respect to the India Affected Employee,
the Deferred India Transfer Date, as the case may be, Buyer shall, or shall
cause an Acquired Company to employ (x) all of the Affected Employees (other
than the OUS Affected Employees and the India Affected Employee) on an at-will
basis, and (y) the OUS Affected Employees and the India Affected Employee in
accordance with their respective Contracts and applicable Law. For a period of
at least 12 months from the Closing Date, Buyer will provide or will cause the
Acquired Companies to provide to each of the Affected Employees: (i) base
salary and base wages and incentive compensation opportunities that are at
least as favorable in the aggregate as such annual base salary and base wages
and incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided by Buyer to its similarly situated employees and (ii)
employee benefits (excluding medical and life insurance benefits for retired
or former employees other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state law) which are at least as favorable in the aggregate as the
employee benefits provided by Buyer to its similarly situated employees;
_provided_ , that nothing in this sentence shall require Buyer, its
Subsidiaries or the Acquired Companies to continue any employee plan or
specific employee benefits during such period; _provided_ , further, that with
respect to the OUS Affected Employees and the India Affected Employee, Buyer
will provide or will cause the Acquired Companies to provide all items
referred to in (i) and (ii) above in accordance and in compliance with
applicable Law. Nothing set forth in this _Section 7.05_ will create a
contract of employment with, or for the benefit of, any Affected Employee or
change such employees status as an employee at will to the extent applicable.

(b) (i) With respect to the U.S. Affected Employees, Seller shall cause the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries to continue to employ each of them until
July 31, 2014 (or for such shorter period as may be notified by Buyer in
writing in accordance 

 



-42-  with the Employee Services Agreement) (the " _Deferred U.S. Transfer Period_
"). Prior to or on the expiration of the Deferred U.S. Transfer Period, Buyer,
one of its Affiliates, or an Acquired Company shall offer employment to each
U.S. Affected Employee, such employment to commence with Buyer, one of its
Affiliates, or an Acquired Company on the expiration of the Deferred U.S.
Transfer Period (the " _Deferred U.S. Transfer Date_ "). Seller shall cause
the Company to take reasonable steps to encourage such Affected Employees to
accept the offer.

 

(ii) With respect to the OUS Affected Employees, Seller shall cause Stanadyne,
S.p.A. to continue to employ each of them until July 31, 2014 (or for such
shorter period as may be notified by Buyer in writing in accordance with the
Employee Services Agreement) (the " _Deferred European Transfer Period_ ").
Prior to or on the expiration of the Deferred European Transfer Period, Buyer
or one of its Affiliates shall offer employment (in accordance with applicable
Law) to (where employment does not continue by operation of Law) or continue
the employment of (where employment continues by operation of Law) each OUS
Affected Employee, such employment to commence with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates prior to or on the expiration of the Deferred European Transfer
Period (the " _Deferred European Transfer Date_ "). Each OUS
Affected Employee who accepts Buyers or its Affiliates offer of employment,
or continues employment by operation of Law with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates, as of the Deferred European Transfer Date shall be referred to as
a " _OUS Transferred Employee_." Seller shall cause Stanadyne, S.p.A. to take
reasonable steps to encourage the OUS Affected Employees to accept the
transfer or offer, as the case may be. Seller shall cause Stanadyne, S.p.A. to
release the OUS Affected Employees from any contractual restrictions owed to
Stanadyne, S.p.A. which would otherwise prevent them from undertaking their
employment duties pursuant to their employment with Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

(iii) With respect to the India Affected Employee, Seller shall cause
Stanadyne Amalgamations Private Limited to continue to employ him until
December 31, 2014 (or for such shorter period as may be notified by Buyer in
writing in accordance with the Employee Services Agreement) (the " _Deferred
India Transfer Period_ "). No less than sixty (60) days prior to the
expiration of the Deferred India Transfer Period, Buyer or one of its
Affiliates shall offer employment to the India Affected Employee, such
employment to commence with Buyer or one of its Affiliates on the expiration
of the Deferred India Transfer Period (the " _Deferred India Transfer Date_
") and shall recognize all years of service rendered by the India Affected
Employee to Stanadyne Amalgamations Private Limited for all purposes. If the
India Affected Employee accepts Buyers or its Affiliates offer of
employment, as of the Deferred India Transfer Date he shall be referred to as
the " _India Transferred Employee_." Seller shall cause Stanadyne
Amalgamations Private Limited to take reasonable steps to encourage the India
Affected Employee to accept employment with Buyer or its applicable Affiliate.

 

(iv) Except to the extent provided in the Employee Services Agreement, if for
any reason any Affected Employee fails to transfer to, or begin employment
with, Buyer, its Affiliates, or an Acquired Company pursuant to this _Section
7.05(b)_, Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no liability for such Affected
Employee.

 



-43- (c) (i) Seller shall cause Stanadyne, S.p.A. to undertake all reasonably
necessary or legally required provisions of information to and/or
consultations with the OUS Affected Employees or their representatives in a
timely manner prior to the Deferred European Transfer Date. Buyer shall or
shall cause its Affiliates to provide Seller and Stanadyne, S.p.A. with such
assistance as reasonably requested by Seller or Stanadyne, S.p.A. in carrying
out such provisions of information to and/or consultations with the OUS
Affected Employees or their representatives. Seller and Stanadyne, S.p.A.
shall be responsible for any liabilities arising from any failure to comply
with any obligation to inform and/or consult with the OUS Affected Employees
or their representatives as required by applicable Law, except to the extent
arising from or relating to Buyers failure to perform its obligations as set
forth in the preceding sentence.

(ii) Seller shall cause Stanadyne Amalgamations Private Limited to undertake
all reasonably necessary or legally required provisions of information to
and/or consultations with the India Affected Employee or his representatives
in a timely manner prior to the Deferred India Transfer Date. Buyer shall or
shall cause its Affiliates to provide Seller and Stanadyne Amalgamations
Private Limited with such assistance as reasonably requested by Seller or
Stanadyne Amalgamations Private Limited in carrying out such provisions of
information to and/or consultations with the India Affected Employee or his
representatives. Seller and Stanadyne Amalgamations Private Limited shall be
responsible for any liabilities arising from any failure to comply with
any obligation to inform and/or consult with the India Affected Employee or
his representatives as required by applicable Law, except to the extent
arising from or relating to Buyers failure to perform its obligations as set
forth in the preceding sentence.

(d) Subject to the approval of any applicable insurer, Buyer will, and will
cause the Acquired Companies to, credit service rendered by the Affected
Employees (whether to Seller, its subsidiaries or the Acquired Companies)
prior to the Affected Employees Transfer Date, the Deferred European Transfer
Date or the Deferred India Transfer Date, as the case may be, for
all purposes (including for purposes of participation, coverage, vesting and
level of benefits but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit plan) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies)
from and after the Affected Employees Transfer Date, the Deferred European
Transfer Date or the Deferred India Transfer Date, as the case may be, to the
same extent as such service was taken into account under corresponding plans
of the Company (or applicable Subsidiary of the Company) and the Acquired
Companies for such purposes. Without limiting the foregoing, the Affected
Employees will (and with respect to insurance arrangements with third
parties, Buyer will take commercially reasonable actions to request any third
party insurance provider to provide, that the Affected Employees will) not be
subject to any pre-existing condition or other limitation under any health or
welfare plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Companies) for any condition for which such Affected Employee would have been
entitled to coverage under the corresponding plan of the Company (or
applicable Subsidiary of the Company) or the Acquired Companies in which such
Affected

 



-44-  Employee participated immediately prior to the Affected Employees Transfer
Date, the Deferred European Transfer Date or the Deferred India Transfer Date,
as the case may be. Subject to the approval of any applicable insurer, Buyer
will cause such Affected Employees to be given credit under such plans for co-
payments and other out-of-pocket expenses made, and deductibles satisfied, for
the plan year in which the Affected Employees Transfer Date, the Deferred
European Transfer Date or the Deferred India Transfer Date, as the case may
be, occurs.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or shall, constitute the
establishment of, or an amendment to, any Plan for any purpose, including
without limitation under ERISA. Nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be
construed so as to: (i) constitute an amendment, waiver or creation of any
Employee Plan or any other benefit plan of any Acquired Company, the Company,
Seller, Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates; or (ii) prevent or
restrict in any way the right of Buyer after the Affected Employees Transfer
Date, the Deferred European Transfer Date or the Deferred India Transfer Date,
as the case may be, to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any employee or
Affected Employee, or to change (adversely or favorably) the title, powers,
duties, responsibilities, functions, compensation, benefits, locations or
other terms or conditions of employment of any such employee or Affected
Employee, subject to the applicable terms of any written agreement between
Buyer and any Affected Employee.

7.06. _Use of Name_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, Buyer shall cause
Holdings to amend Holdings certificate of incorporation as required to
change Holdings corporate name to a new name that is reasonably dissimilar to
Holdings current name so as to avoid confusion.

 

(b) Buyer agrees that, except as provided in the Intellectual Property License
Agreement and the Trademark and Co-Use Agreement, (i) no Acquired Company
shall have any right to use, and the Buyer shall cause each Acquired Company
not to use, the name "Stanadyne" or any service marks, Trademarks, trade
names, identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto
or containing or comprising the foregoing, including any Trademark confusingly
similar thereto (collectively, the " _Retained Marks_ "), and (ii) Buyer shall
cause each Acquired Company not to at any time hold itself out as having any
further affiliation with the Company or any of its Affiliates. Subject to the
Intellectual Property License Agreement and the Trademark and Co-Use
Agreement, in furtherance of the preceding sentence, as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause each Acquired Company to remove, strike
over or otherwise obliterate all Retained Marks from all materials owned by
such Acquired Company including, without limitation, any business cards,
schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional
materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other materials other than
internal documents and materials retained in the ordinary course of business;
_provided_ , that the Acquired Companies may use the name "Stanadyne" to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable Law or as necessary with respect to
any court filings.

8_ on or prior to the applicable survival date as specified herein shall
survive such survival date until the final resolution thereof.

 

8.02. _Indemnification for the Benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Parties_. From
and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article 8_ ),
the Seller Entities shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) and their respective directors, officers, representatives
and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from any and
all Losses suffered, incurred or paid by any Buyer Indemnified Party, whether
or not involving a Third Party Claim, as a result of or arising out of (a)
any breach of any representation or warranty by Seller contained in _Article
3_ or _4_ or the Seller Closing Certificate, (b) any breach of or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement of Seller, Holdings or the Company contained
in this Agreement that is to be performed on or prior to the Closing, (c) any
breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Seller or the
Company contained in this Agreement that is to be performed after the Closing,
(d) any Retained Liabilities, (e) the Restructuring (including any Taxes
incurred by the Acquired Companies for the Restructuring), (f) any liabilities
or obligations of Holdings to holders of equity interests (including stock
options) in Holdings at any time prior to the Closing to the extent with
respect to such equity interests (including any notice or demand by any
stockholder of Holdings of such stockholders intent to exercise appraisal
rights under the DGCL in connection with the Restructuring, any exercise of
appraisal rights by any stockholder of Holdings and appraisal proceedings in
connection therewith, and any payments required to be made by any Buyer
Indemnified Party in respect of dissenting shares upon the exercise of

 



-46-  appraisal rights) and (g) any Taxes of Holdings, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, or
allocable to the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date; any
Taxes of any Person (other than the Acquired Companies) imposed on the
Acquired Companies as a transferee or successor, by contract (except for
contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business that do not
primarily relate to Taxes) or pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), which Taxes relate
to an event, transaction or time period occurring before the Closing,
provided, however, that the parties agree that the Seller shall have no
indemnification obligation or other liability in respect of any Tax attributes
of any of the Acquired Companies.

 

8.03. _Indemnification for the Benefit of the Seller Indemnified Parties_.
From and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this _Article 8_
), Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, representatives and agents (collectively, the
" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from any and all Losses suffered, incurred
or paid by any Seller Indemnified Party, whether or not involving a Third
Party Claim, as a result of or arising out of (a) any breach of any
representation or warranty by Buyer contained in _Article 5_ or the
Buyer Closing Certificate, (b) any breach of or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement that is to be
performed on or prior to the Closing, (c) any breach of or failure to perform
any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement that is to be
performed after the Closing, (d) any Assumed Liabilities ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this clause (d) will not be construed to limit the right of a
Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.02(a)_ for
any breach of a representation or warranty that is related to an Assumed
Liability), and (e) any Losses from Taxes for which the Company or
Intermediate Holdco might have liability under Treasury Regulations section
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) that Buyer
or any of its Affiliates become liable for as a result of post-Closing
activities of the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates or related to the
Business.

8.04. _Limitations on Indemnification_. The rights of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 8_ are subject to the following limitations,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(a) No claims for indemnification by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 8.02(a)_ or _8.02(b)_ with respect to  _Section 6.08_ shall be
asserted, and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any
Losses in respect of any indemnification claim made pursuant to such sections,
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be
payable pursuant to such sections collectively exceeds on a cumulative basis
the Deductible Amount, and if the amount of such Losses exceeds the Deductible
Amount, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be permitted to recover
the amount of such Losses that exceed the Deductible Amount, but subject in
all cases to the other terms set forth in this _Article 8_ ; _provided_ , that
the Deductible Amount shall not apply to Losses suffered, incurred or paid by
any Buyer Indemnified Party as a result of the breach of any representation
or warranty of the Seller contained in _Sections 3.01_ (Organization and
Corporate Power), _3.02(a)_ (Authorization; Valid and Binding Agreement),
_3.03_  (Capitalization and Subsidiaries), _3.08_ (Tax Matters), _3.20_
(Questionable Payments and Trade Regulation), _3.22_ (Brokerage), _4.01_
(Organization, Power

 



-47-  and Standing) _4.02_ (Authorization) and _4.04_ (Ownership) (collectively,
the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), it being agreed that, in such
circumstances, the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party shall, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this _Article 8_ , be entitled to be
indemnified and held harmless from the first dollar of such Losses, and any
such Losses shall not count towards the Deductible Amount;

(b) In no event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover any
Losses in respect of any indemnification claim or claims made pursuant to
_Section 8.02(a)_ or _8.02(b)_ with respect to _Section 6.08_, collectively,
in an aggregate amount in excess of the Cap Amount, _provided_ , that the Cap
Amount shall not apply to Losses suffered, incurred or paid by any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to such sections as a result of the breach of any
Fundamental Representations and; _provided_ , _further_ , that the parties
acknowledge and agree that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall recover any
Losses suffered, incurred or paid by any Buyer Indemnified Party as a result
of the breach of any Fundamental Representation in excess of the Cap Amount,
first, from the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy (in each case to
the extent actually recovered thereunder following such Buyer Indemnified
Partys commercially reasonable efforts to make such recovery in accordance
with _Section 8.04(c)_) and, thereafter, from the Seller Entities;

(c) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Sections 8.02_ or
_8.03_ shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually realized by
the Indemnitee as a result of sustaining such Loss and (ii) any insurance
proceeds (excluding any recoveries under the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section
8.04(c)_, and including, without limitation, any amounts received by any Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to or in connection with _Section 6.12_ or
_Section 10.06_) (the " _Applicable Insurance Proceeds_ ") actually
recovered by the Indemnitee (net of any applicable deductibles or similar
costs or payments and costs of recovery or collection thereof) with respect to
such Loss. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean, with respect to
any Loss subject to indemnity under _Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_ (or any
correlative adjustment with respect thereto), an amount by which the Tax
liability of a party (or a group of Persons filing a Tax Return that includes
such party), with respect to a taxable period, is reduced as a result of such
Loss (or correlative adjustment) or the amount of Tax refund that is generated
as a result of such Loss or correlative adjustment), and any related interest
received or receivable from any relevant taxing authority, but only to the
extent such Tax Benefit is not offset by additional taxes, or a decrease in
tax refund, related to the actual receipt of any indemnity payment
provided herein. The Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
submit in good faith any available claims relating to Losses hereunder for
recovery under any applicable insurance policies held by, or for the benefit
of, the Indemnitee with respect to the Applicable Insurance Proceeds. In the
event that Applicable Insurance Proceeds or any Tax Benefit are actually
recovered or received or any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
is actually received by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any
such Indemnitee has previously been indemnified hereunder, then the Indemnitee
shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor the amount of such recovery (net of any
applicable deductibles or similar costs or payments and costs of recovery or
collection thereof), but in no event shall the amount of such payment to the
Indemnitor exceed the amount of the indemnification payment made to the
Indemnitee. The parties acknowledge and agree that the "Applicable Insurance
Proceeds" will not include any insurance proceeds recovered under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in

 



-48-  the case of any claim brought by any Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of
any breach of any Fundamental Representation or any item enumerated in
_Section 8.02(b)_ through _(g)_ , Applicable Insurance Proceeds will include
any insurance proceeds actually recovered by Buyer in respect of such claim
under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy (net of the costs of
recovery or collection thereof). Each Indemnitee shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to recover any Applicable Insurance Proceeds that it
reasonably determines it would be reasonably likely to collect or receive;

 

(d) In no event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover any
Losses in respect of any indemnification claim or claims made pursuant to
_Section 8.02(a)_ to the extent such Losses were included in the calculation
of Net Working Capital or Sellers Transaction Expenses; and

 

(e) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses to which a Buyer
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party is entitled under  _Section
8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.03(a)_ (other than with respect to the Seller Closing
Certificate and the Buyer Closing Certificate), and for purposes of
determining whether a representation or warranty has been breached
(other than with respect to the Seller Closing Certificate and the Buyer
Closing Certificate), the terms "material," "materiality," and "material
adverse effect" will be disregarded.

 

8.05. _Indemnification Procedures; Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party that may be entitled
to indemnification under _Sections 8.02_ or _8.03_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ")
shall promptly notify the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") in writing
of any claim threatened in writing or otherwise asserted by a third party
against the Indemnitee that the Indemnitee has determined has given or would
reasonably be expected to give rise to such right of indemnification (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail (to the extent then
known by Indemnitee) the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim or demand; _provided_ , that the failure to provide such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this
_Article 8_ except to the extent the Indemnitor is prejudiced by such
failure, it being agreed that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the
expiration of any applicable survival period specified in  _Section 8.01_
for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. This _Section
8.05(a)_ shall not apply with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Claim or Straddle
Tax Claim, which shall be governed exclusively by  _Section 10.01(e)_.

(b) If an Indemnitor receives notice of a Third Party Claim pursuant to
_Section 8.05(a)_, the Indemnitor shall, at its sole cost and expense, be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Section 8.05_ and the consent rights of any Insurer or
other limitations in the Representations and Warranty Insurance Policy, be
entitled to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee (and subject to any consent
rights with respect to such counsel provided for under the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy) by delivering notice in writing of its election to
do so to the Indemnitee within fifteen (15) business days of the receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor so elects to assume the
defense of such

 



-49-  Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnitee may reasonably participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel at its own expense (to
the extent such expenses are incurred in such defense), and (ii) such
assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the
claims made in such Third Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to
indemnification under the terms of this _Article 8_. Subject to the terms of
this _Article 8_ , the Indemnitor shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of one (1) counsel (plus one (1) local counsel, if required) of the Indemnitee
in the event that the Third Party Claim of which the Indemnitor seeks to
assume control involves a claim that outside legal counsel to the Indemnitee
has advised the Indemnitee is inappropriate for joint representation due to an
actual or potential conflict of interest between the Indemnitee and
the Indemnitor with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor does
not assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor
may nonetheless reasonably participate in the defense of such Third Party
Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. __

(c) If the Indemnitor assumes the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
no settlement or compromise of, or the entry of any judgment arising from,
any Third Party Claim, may be made by the Indemnitor without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitee(s), unless (i) the settlement or judgment does not
involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any
wrongdoing by any Indemnitee, (ii) the sole relief provided by the settlement
or judgment is monetary payments that are paid in full by the Indemnitor and
(iii) the Indemnitor obtains, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete release of any Indemnitee(s) affected by such Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , that any settlement or judgment (whether
or not the consent of the Indemnitee(s) is required as set forth above) will
require the consent of any Insurer to the extent provided under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy. If the Indemnitor does not
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this  _Section
8.05(c)_, the Indemnitor will not be bound by any determination of any such
Third Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any
compromise or settlement with respect thereto effected without its prior
written consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Indemnitee
reasonably determines that a Third Party Claim is reasonably likely to
materially affect the Business acquired hereunder or the Indemnitee in an
adverse manner other than as a result of monetary damages for which
the Indemnitee would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement or
recoveries under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, (ii) if the
Third Party Claim were to be unfavorably decided, the sum of (A) the amount of
Losses the Indemnitee(s) would reasonably be expected to be liable for
hereunder, plus (B) the amount of Losses that would reasonably be expected to
be payable under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, exceeds the
amount of Losses reasonably expected to be received from the Indemnitor
pursuant to this _Article 8_ or (iii) in the case of a Third Party Claim
against a Buyer Indemnified Party, (x) the assumption of the defense by the
Indemnitor is reasonably likely to cause any Buyer Indemnified Party to lose
coverage under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy or (y) a Buyer
Indemnified Party or any Insurer is required to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Insurance
Policy, the Indemnitee may, by notice to the Indemnitor, assume (or, as
applicable, cause any such Insurer to assume) the exclusive right to defend,
compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, at the cost and expense of
Indemnitor (to the extent subject to indemnification hereunder),

 



-50-  but the Indemnitor will not be bound by any determination of any such Third
Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise
or settlement with respect thereto effected without its consent (which may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) With respect to any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this _Section 8.05_: (i) both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, as the case
may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed in all material respects of
the status of such Third Party Claim and any related proceedings at all
stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and
(ii) the parties agree to render to each other such assistance as they may
reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each
other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third Party
Claim.

8.06. _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, without limitation of the rights of the
parties hereto pursuant to _Article 1_ , except for (i) in the case of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties as provided in the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy, (ii) the right of a party to pursue specific performance
pursuant to _Section 12.16_ and (iii) subject to  _Section 10.08_, any
claim of intentional fraud asserted against the Person who committed such
fraud, in each case, the indemnification terms set forth in this _Article 8_
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties for any and all
Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement or the
Contribution Agreement, including in any Schedule or certificate delivered
hereunder or thereunder, and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(other than with respect to any claims to the extent relating to or arising
from the Intellectual Property License Agreement, the Trademark and Co-Use
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Employee Services
Agreement, any Seller Release or any Restrictive Covenant Agreement, which may
be brought under such agreement in accordance with the terms thereof), in each
case regardless of the legal theory under which such liability or obligation
may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether
at law or in equity, or otherwise, and the parties hereto hereby agree that no
Person (and no Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party) shall
have any remedy or recourse with respect to any of the foregoing other than as
expressly set forth in this _Article 8_ (and subject to the limitations and
terms set forth in this _Article 8_ ).

 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree, on their behalf and on behalf of
the Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties, that from and
after the Closing no Indemnitee may avoid the limitation on liability set
forth in this _Article 8_ by (x) seeking damages for breach of contract, tort
or pursuant to any other theory of liability outside of the indemnification
provisions set forth herein, all of which are hereby waived, or (y) asserting
or threatening any claim against any Person that is not a party hereto for
breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the
provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits
imposed on the remedies of the parties hereto (and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties) with respect to this Agreement and
the Contribution Agreement, including in any Schedule or certificate hereunder
or thereunder, and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to Seller hereunder.

 



-51- 8.07. _Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving
a Third Party Claim may be asserted by (a) in the case of any claim by any
Buyer Indemnified Party under _Section 8.02_, written notice to Seller and
(b) in the case of any claim by any Seller Indemnified Party under _Section
8.03_, written notice to Buyer.

8.08. _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made pursuant to
the indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the purchase price paid by Buyer for the Closing Shares
for all applicable Tax purposes.

 

8.09. _Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy_. Seller acknowledges that
Buyer is entering into the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy and
that, in connection therewith, a Buyer Indemnified Party may make claims for
the same Loss or series of related Losses under both this _Article 8_ and the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy; _provided_ , that in no event
may a Buyer Indemnified Party recover amounts from Seller and pursuant to the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy aggregating an amount in excess
of its Losses with respect to such claim, and any such excess amounts received
by any such Buyer Indemnified Party shall promptly be paid over to Seller in
accordance with _Section 8.04(c)_. Seller further acknowledges and agrees
that the denial of any claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy shall not be construed as, or
used as evidence that, such Buyer Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under this _Article 8_.

 

8.10. _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take, or cause to be taken, commercially reasonable steps, consistent with
prudent business practices, to mitigate all Losses after obtaining knowledge
of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses
which are indemnifiable hereunder.

 

ARTICLE 9

_TERMINATION _

9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a breach by Seller, Holdings or the Company of
any covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which
has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Buyer
and such breach has not been waived in writing by Buyer or cured by Seller,
Holdings or the Company within ten days after receipt of written notice
thereof from Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)_ if Buyer
is then in material breach of this Agreement;

 



-52- (c) by Seller, if there has been a breach by Buyer of any covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has prevented
the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Seller and such breach
has not been waived in writing by Seller or cured by Buyer within ten days
after receipt of written notice thereof by Seller ( _provided_ that neither a
breach by Buyer of _Section 5.07_ hereof nor the failure to deliver the full
consideration payable pursuant to _Article 1_ under this Agreement at the
Closing as required hereunder will be subject to cure hereunder unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.01(c)_ if Seller is then in material breach of this Agreement;

(d) by either Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated by 5:00 p.m., New York City time on May 14, 2014, or such
later date as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that neither Buyer nor Seller shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_ if
such Person is then in material breach of this Agreement; or

(e) by either Seller or Buyer if any Order of any Governmental Body
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been issued and becomes
final and non-appealable.

 

9.02. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Buyer or Seller as provided above, all rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate and no party hereto shall
have any liability to the other parties, except that the obligations of the
parties set forth in this _Section 9.02_, _Section 10.04_, and  _Article
12_ hereof which will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their terms; _provided_ , however, that nothing in this _Article 9_ will
be deemed to (i) impair the right of any party to compel specific performance
by another party of its obligations under this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 12.16_ or (ii) relieve any party hereto from liability for willful
breaches of this Agreement arising prior to the termination of
this Agreement.

ARTICLE 10 __

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

 

10.01. _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

(i) _Filing of Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Seller, at Sellers expense, shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed,
all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies for all taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "). All Pre-
Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with applicable law, and
to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the past practice of
Seller, Holdings and their Subsidiaries in preparing Tax Returns. Seller shall
provide Buyer with each Pre-Closing Tax Return no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for such Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions of time to file) for Buyers review and comment. The
Seller shall 

 



-53-  consider all of Buyers comments in good faith and attempt in good faith to
resolve all their differences, _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall
control the valuation of RetainCo, provided Seller utilizes a reasonable
application of a reasonable valuation method in establishing such value.
Neither Buyer nor the Acquired Companies shall (nor shall they cause any
Affiliate to) make any election under Code Sections 338 and 336(e) (or any
similar provision under state, local or non-U.S. law) with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or make or change any tax election
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or take any
other action (including but not limited to filing any amended Tax Return)
which could result in a liability in respect of Taxes for which Seller or its
Affiliates is liable without the prior written consent of Seller.

 

(ii) _Filing of Straddle Tax Returns_. Buyer, at its own expense, shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
of the Acquired Companies (which shall not include Tax Returns of any other
entities) for Straddle Periods (each, a " _Straddle Tax Return_ "). Buyer
shall provide a copy of those Tax Returns to Seller for its review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to their due date, shall make changes
to such Tax Returns to reflect Sellers reasonable comments consistent with
the past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies which relate to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall timely file or cause to be timely filed all
such Tax Returns. All Straddle Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance
with applicable law, and to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law,
the past practice of Seller, Holdings and their Subsidiaries in preparing
income Tax Returns. Buyer shall provide Seller with each Straddle Tax Return
no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Straddle Tax
Return (taking into account applicable extensions of time to file) for
Sellers review. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the portion of Taxes of the
Acquired Companies reflected as due on any Straddle Tax Return attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date
at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Taxes are due.

(iii) _Straddle Periods_. For all purposes under this Agreement, whenever it
is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of Holdings and its
Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending
on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two (2) taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close
of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit of the Acquired Companies for the Straddle Period shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of the Acquired Companies were closed
at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that periodic Taxes
(other than income, franchise/capital, sales, use, or withholding Taxes) such
as real and personal property Taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between such
periods based on the number of days for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the number of
days for the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date,
on the other hand.

 



-54- (iv) _Refunds_. Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive
immediate payment from Buyer of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes,
net of any cost to Buyer or the Company attributable to the obtaining and
receipt of such refund or credit, plus any interest received with respect
thereto from the applicable Governmental Bodies, relating to the Company that
are described as being the responsibility of the Company in this _Article 10_
or that relate to a Straddle Period, but only in excess of any such amounts
that have been included in the calculation of the Net Working Capital.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to any refund or
credit that arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit
from a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.
Buyer and the Company shall be deemed to realize a reduction in such Taxes as
of the date the Tax Return that reflects such reduction is filed. To the
extent such refund or credit is subsequently disallowed or required to
be returned to the applicable Governmental Body, Seller agrees to promptly
repay the amount of such refund or credit, together with any interest,
penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Tax Authority, to Buyer
or the Company, as the case may be.

(b) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
between the Company or Intermediate Holdco on the one hand and any Acquired
Companies on the other shall be terminated at or prior to the Closing and,
after the Closing, the Company, Intermediate Holdco and the Acquired Companies
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder, whether for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or any other tax period.

(c) _Cooperation_. The parties will cooperate with each other to provide each
other with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns, including any Tax audit or
other examination in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding
involving a taxing authority relating to Taxes and the enforcement of the
provisions of this _Section 10.01(c)_. Such cooperation will include,
including upon Sellers request, providing records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such matters and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Seller will each pay 50% of any transfer Tax,
documentary Tax, sales Tax, registration Tax, real property Tax, stamp Tax or
other similar Tax imposed on Holdings or Seller as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_
"), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes. Buyer
shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to

(excluding the NFIP Policy, the " _Policies_ "), other than with respect to
any claim, act, omission, event, circumstance, occurrence or loss that arises
from, occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date (hereinafter, a "

-58-  Agreement, with respect to any Triggering Event to the extent with respect

of the Policies, the Acquired Companies may access, make claims on, seek
coverage under or claim benefits from such Policies following the Closing,
subject to the terms and conditions of such Policies (including
any applicable deductible or self-insured retention, which, for the avoidance
of doubt, would be Buyers sole responsibility to the extent of such claims,
coverage or benefits sought by Buyer or any such Acquired Company). Seller and
the Company shall reasonably cooperate with the Acquired Companies and Buyer
in making such claims on, securing insurance coverage under and recovering
claim benefits from such Policies and shall not terminate any such Policies
prior to the expiration of their current terms in a manner that would prevent
the Acquired Companies from recovering thereunder pursuant to the terms of

or abrogate in any way Sellers or the Companys own rights to insurance
coverage under the Policies.

Holdings, shall provide notices of appraisal rights to stockholders of
Holdings in connection with the Restructuring.

proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has
determined to rely only on the representations and warranties of the Seller
expressly and specifically set forth in _Articles 3_ and _4_ of this Agreement
and the Seller Closing Certificate, and on no other representations or
warranties of Seller or its Affiliates or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, members or representatives. Subject to the
representations and warranties of the Seller expressly and specifically set
forth in _Articles 3_ and _4_ of this Agreement and the Seller Closing
Certificate and the liability of the Seller Entities hereunder with respect
thereto, Buyer further agrees that, subject to _Section 12.19_, none of
Seller nor any of its past, present or future direct or indirect Affiliates,
directors officers, members, employees or representatives will have or be

Buyer, or Buyers use of, any information regarding the Business or the
Acquired Companies furnished or made available to Buyer or its
representatives, including any information, document or material made
available to Buyer or its Affiliates or representatives in the Data Site,
management presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with Buyers investigation of
the Business and the Acquired Companies, Buyer has received from or on behalf
of Seller certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Business and the Acquired
Companies. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts), and that Buyer has not relied on any of the foregoing and will
have no claim against Seller or any other Person with respect thereto.

party, and at such requesting partys sole expense, any other party will
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents
and instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to

is reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the omission of any cross-reference
thereto. Capitalized terms used in the disclosure schedules and not otherwise
defined therein

 



-76-  have the meanings given to them in this Agreement. The specification of any
dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the disclosure schedules or
Exhibits is not intended to imply that the amounts, or higher or lower
amounts, or the items so included, or other items, are or are not required to
be disclosed (including, without limitation, whether such amounts or
items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or are within
or outside of the ordinary course of business, and no party will use the fact
of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this
Agreement or the disclosure schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any disclosure schedule or
Exhibit is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount
or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within
or outside of the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.
The information contained in this Agreement and in the disclosure schedules
and Exhibits is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no
information contained herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by
any party to any third party of any matter whatsoever (including,
without limitation, any violation of law or breach of contract).

12.08. _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement or
the disclosure schedules or Exhibits may be amended or waived only in a
writing signed by Buyer and Seller. No waiver of any provision hereunder or
any breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

12.09. _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the side letter
executed concurrently herewith and the documents referred to herein
(including the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to the terms of _Section
10.04_) contain the complete agreement between the parties and supersede any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or between the
parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof
in any way.

12.10.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts (including by means of telecopied signature pages or electronic
transmission in portable document format (pdf)), any one of which need not
contain the signatures of more than one party, but all such counterparts
taken together will constitute one and the same instrument.

12.11. _Governing Law_. All matters relating to the interpretation,
construction, validity and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

12.12. _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Subject to _Section
1.03_ (which will govern any dispute arising thereunder), the parties to this
Agreement submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court
(or, if the Delaware Chancery Court shall be unavailable, any other court of
the State of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the federal courts
have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and any
related agreement, certificate or other document delivered

 



-77-  in connection herewith and by this Agreement waive, and agree not to assert,
any defense in any action for the interpretation or enforcement of this
Agreement and any related agreement, certificate or other document delivered
in connection herewith, that they are not subject thereto or that such action
may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that this
Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts or that their property is
exempt or immune from execution, that the action is brought in an inconvenient
forum, or that the venue of the action is improper. Service of process with
respect thereto may be made upon Buyer by mailing a copy thereof
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address as provided in _Section 12.04_.

12.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (i) no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (ii) each such party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (iii) each such party makes this waiver
voluntarily, and (iv) each such party has been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section 12.13_.

12.14. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No Person other than the parties will
have any rights, remedies, obligations or benefits under any provision of
this Agreement, other than _Sections 12.15_ and _12.19_ (to the extent
provided therein), except for (i) the directors and officers of the Acquired
Companies solely with respect to _Section 7.01_ and (ii) Kohlberg and Company,
L.L.C. and its Affiliates solely with respect to _Section 12.01_ and (iii)
Ropes and Gray LLP with respect to _Section 12.15_.

 

12.15. _Representation of Seller and its Affiliates_. Buyer agrees that,
following the Closing, Ropes and Gray LLP may serve as counsel to Seller and
its respective Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this
Agreement or any related agreement, certificate or other document delivered in
connection herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any related agreement, certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby notwithstanding any representation by Ropes and Gray LLP
prior to the Closing Date of the Acquired Companies. Buyer (on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries, including, following the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) hereby (i) waives any claim they have or may have that Ropes and
Gray LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging
in such representation and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a dispute
arises after the Closing between Buyer, any Acquired Company and Seller or
any of its Affiliates, Ropes and Gray LLP may represent Seller or any of
Sellers Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Acquired Companies and even
though Ropes and Gray LLP may have represented the Acquired Companies in a
matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer (on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries,

 



-78-  including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies) also further
agrees that, as to all communications among Ropes and Gray LLP and the Acquired
Companies and Seller or Sellers Affiliates and representatives, that relate
in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any related
agreement, certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
Seller and may be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer or any Acquired Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that a dispute arises between Buyer, any Acquired Company and a third party
other than a party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Acquired Companies
may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Ropes and Gray LLP to such third party;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Acquired Company may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of Seller.

12.16.  _Specific Performance; Other Remedies_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its terms. The
parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of damages and without posting a bond, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or equity, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none
of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(b) Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
have an adequate remedy at law. The parties acknowledge and agree that any
party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such injunction.

12.17. _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement may
be required from parties to contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements
(the " _Contract Consents_ ") to which Seller, its Subsidiaries, or any
Acquired Company is a party (including the contracts set forth on _Schedule
3.09(a)_ ) and that certain Contract Consents have not been obtained. Buyer
agrees and acknowledges that Seller and its Affiliates will have no liability
whatsoever to Buyer Indemnified Parties (and Buyer Indemnified Parties will
not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any Contract Consents that may have been or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because
of the default, acceleration or termination of any such contract, lease,
license or other agreement as a result thereof. Buyer further agrees that no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller, Holdings or the Company
contained herein will be breached or deemed breached and no condition of Buyer
will be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to obtain any 

 



-79-  Contract Consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or
termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any Contract Consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this _Section 12.17_ will limit Buyers remedies to the extent that
Seller has failed to disclose a Contract Consent required to be disclosed in
the disclosure schedules of Seller or has otherwise breached the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_
hereof.

 

12.18. _Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and any signed agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto will re execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument will
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity. 

12.19. _Limitation on Recourse_. Absent intentional fraud, no claim shall be
brought or maintained by any party hereto or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates or their respective successors or permitted assigns
against any officer, director, employee (present or former) or Affiliate of
Buyer, the Acquired Companies or Seller, as applicable (who shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 12.19_), which is not otherwise
expressly identified as a party hereto, and, absent intentional fraud, no
recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or
based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations, warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or
contained in this Agreement or the Contribution Agreement or the Buyer Closing
Certificate or Seller Closing Certificate, as applicable.

12.20. _Deliveries to Buyer_. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that all documents
or other items delivered to Buyer or Buyers representatives (including,
without limitation, Buyers accountants and any of Buyers legal counsel) or
uploaded and made available on the Data Site on or before the date that is two
(2) days prior to the date hereof will be deemed to be delivered or made
available to Buyer for purposes of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, in determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_  hereof.
