of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.02(e)</U>) or Book-Entry
Share.</P>

by clause (i) of the definition thereof has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at

by clause (i) of the definition thereof </FONT>are funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.02</U>. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent&rsquo;s obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to
consummate the Transactions if the Debt Financing contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof has not been funded
(or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).</P>
