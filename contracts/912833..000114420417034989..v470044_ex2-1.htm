Article I 
 THE MERGER

  



  

Section 1.01   _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the
Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon
the separate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed
to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub and the Company in
accordance with Section 259 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 1.02   _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") will take place (a) at 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the date that is
two (2) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) or (b) at another time or date agreed to in writing by the parties.
The Closing will take place at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 1001 Page
Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304, or at another place agreed to in
writing by the parties. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs shall
be referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

  



  

Section 1.03   _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Closing, the
Company shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and
time at which the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or at such other later date and time as is
agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such
date and time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.04   _Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the
Surviving Corporation_.

  



  

(a) _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, (i) the
Company Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ ,
and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the Company By-laws shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and restated,
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that references to
the name of Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving
Corporation), in each case until, subject to _Section 5.07_,
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable

Corporation.

of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Article II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 2.01   _Conversion of Securities_.

  



  

(a)  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any
capital stock of the Company or Sub:

  



  

(i)   _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive $12.97 in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), and all of such Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall cease to exist, and each certificate representing a Share
(a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Share represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") that formerly represented any of the Shares (other than
the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter be cancelled
and cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, subject to _Section
2.05_.

  



  

(ii)   _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned
Shares_. All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of
record by any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of
record by Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (such Shares, the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no
payment being made with respect thereto.

  



  

(iii)   _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share
of capital stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



    

 7

 



    



  

(b)   _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event.

  



  

Section 2.02   _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

  



  

(a)   _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
holders of Shares to receive the funds to which such holders shall become
entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in immediately available funds, a cash
amount equal to the sum of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the holders
of Shares that are entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes
of determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume
that no stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of
such stockholder or its Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ and
this _Section 2.02_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to make such
payments. Funds made available to the Paying Agent may be invested by the
Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, but only in short-term obligations of,
or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by,
the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, pending payment thereof by the
Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ and
_Section 2.02_; _provided_ , that no investment of such deposited funds
shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from
promptly making the payments required by _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ and this
_Section 2.02_, and following any losses from any such investment, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Shares, in the amount of such losses, which additional
funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds initially
deposited with the Paying Agent to make the payments contemplated by _Section
2.01(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.02_. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall
direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the
former holders of Shares and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in
accordance with  _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ and _Section 2.02_. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to
_Section 2.01(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.02_, except as expressly provided for in
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the second Business
Day following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement:
(i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_ to the Paying Agent) and shall otherwise
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify after consultation with the Company and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
in proper form, with respect to such Certificate, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion
of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_), and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made and the Merger Consideration may
be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered and shall be
made promptly following the Effective Time without any action on the part of
the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger Consideration payable
upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) or Book-Entry Share.

  



  

   

 8

 



    



  

  

(c)   _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_.
As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares
shall represent full payment and satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No
Liability_. At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest
received with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Shares and compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_,
without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for
Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(e)   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent)
of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section
2.01(a)(i)_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Paying Agent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

  



  

Section 2.03   _Treatment of Company Options, RSUs and Equity Plans_.

  



  

(a)   _Treatment of Company Options_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company's board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Shares granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan (the "
_Company Options_ ") shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled
to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option and
(ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option, without
interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option Payments_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such Company Option with respect to
which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (ii)
such Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective
Time, no Company Option shall be exercisable, and each Company Option shall
only entitle the holder thereof to the payment provided for in this _Section
2.03(a)_.

  



  

   

 9

 



    



  

(b) _Treatment of Employee Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company's board of directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding unvested award
of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock
units (each, an " _RSU_ ") with respect to Shares (each, an " _RSU Award_ ")
granted pursuant to the Company Equity Incentive Plan, other than any RSU
Award held by a non-employee director of the Company, shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation and shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Merger Consideration,
multiplied by (ii) the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award (the " _Cash
Replacement Company RSU Awards_ "), which Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards
will, subject to the holder's continued employment with the Surviving
Corporation through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the
same time as the RSU Awards for which such Cash Replacement RSU Awards were
exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms. All Cash Replacement
Company RSU Awards will have the same terms and conditions (including,
with respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting on specific
terminations of employment, to the extent applicable)) and settlement as
applied to the RSU Awards for which they were exchanged, except for terms
rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or for such other administrative or ministerial changes that are not
materially detrimental to the holders and that in the reasonable and good
faith determination of Parent are necessary for the administration of the
Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards; provided, however, that no such change
shall cause the Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards to violate Code Section
409A. To the extent an RSU Award is subject to performance conditions, the
number of RSUs that are assumed by the Surviving Corporation and are converted
into Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards shall be determined (A) for RSU
Awards with a performance period that by its terms has ended prior to the
Effective Time, based on actual performance through the end of such
performance period, and (B) for RSU Awards with a performance period that by
its terms has not ended prior to the Effective Time, assuming performance of
100% of target levels.

  



  

(c)   _Treatment of Director Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company's board of directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding unvested _RSU
Award_ granted pursuant to the Company Equity Incentive Plan and held by a
non-employee director of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of
any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of
the cancellation of such RSU Award and in settlement therefor, a payment in
cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award, without
interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_ ") (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.05).

  



  

(d)   _Termination of Company Equity Incentive Plan and Company
Stock Purchase Plan_. 

  



  

(i)  As of the Effective Time, the Company Equity Incentive
Plan and the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate, and no further
Company Options, RSUs or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.

  



  

(ii) As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
action that may be necessary to: (A) cause any outstanding offering period
under the Company Stock Purchase Plan to be terminated prior to the Effective
Time; (B) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period
as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Company Stock Purchase Plan; (C) provide that all outstanding options granted
under the Company Stock Purchase Plan (the " _SPP Options_ ") shall be
cancelled as of the Closing Date (if not terminated earlier pursuant to the
terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan), provided that each holder of an SPP
Option may exercise (consistent with the Company Stock Purchase Plan and
prior to the Effective Time) each outstanding purchase right under
the Company Stock Purchase Plan; (D) provide that no further offering period

respect to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of restrictions
or other actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by the Surviving
Corporation, Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or RSU
Awards in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation, Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Article IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB

  



  

Except as disclosed in the separate disclosure letter that is being delivered
by Parent and Sub to the Company on the date of this Agreement, including the
documents attached to or incorporated by reference in such disclosure letter
(the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any
item in any section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall also
be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection in
this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure), Parent and Sub hereby jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Company:

or other legal entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each of Parent and Sub has requisite corporate or other legal
entity, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, except where any such failure to be so organized, existing, in
good standing or have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.02 _Authority_. Each of Parent and Sub has the requisite
corporate or other legal entity power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Sub and the consummation by

or other legal entity action on the part of Parent and Sub, and no other
corporate or other legal entity proceedings on the part of Parent or Sub are
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Parent and
Sub of this Agreement or the consummation by Parent or Sub of the
Transactions other than the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its
capacity as sole stockholder of Sub (which adoption shall occur immediately
following the execution of this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent and Sub and (assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company) constitutes the
valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub enforceable against each of
them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception.

approval under, violate, conflict with, result in any breach of or any loss
of any benefit under, or constitute a default under (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both), or result in termination or give to others any
right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon any of the
respective properties or assets of Parent or Sub pursuant to, any Contract to
which Parent or Sub is a party (or by which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound) or any Permit held by it or them, except, with
respect to _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for (A) any such consents and
approvals, the failure to obtain which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability
of Parent and Sub to consummate the Transactions and (B) any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, losses, defaults, terminations, rights of termination,
vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of Liens that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent and Sub to consummate the
Transactions.

  



  

(b)  None of the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement by or on behalf of Parent or Sub or the consummation by Parent or

prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent and Sub to consummate the
Transactions.

  



  

   

 25

 



    



  

Section 4.04   _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Sub or any of their respective
affiliates expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the time the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, at any

Proxy Statement is first published, sent or given to the holders of Shares,
as applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

  



  

Section 4.05   _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is
no Proceeding to which Parent or Sub is a party pending or, to the knowledge

capital of Sub consists of 1,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share, 100 of
which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
share capital of Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent
or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and it has not
conducted any business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and
prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incidental to its formation and pursuant
to this Agreement and the Transactions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, as contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter or any other
agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with this Agreement).

  



  

(b)  As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent, Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule
13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities
that are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds
any rights to acquire or vote any Shares, other than pursuant to this
Agreement. None of Parent, Sub, any of their respective Subsidiaries, or the
"affiliates" or "Associates" of any such entity is, and at no time during the
last three years has been, an "Interested Stockholder" of the Company, in
each case as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 4.07   _Financing._

  



  

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to
the Company a true and complete copy of (i) an executed equity commitment
agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Equity Commitment Agreement_
"), among Parent, Sub and Guarantor, pursuant to which Guarantor has agreed,
according to the terms and subject to the conditions therein, to fund an
amount sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses no later than immediately
prior to the Closing (the " _Equity Financing_ "), (ii) the Limited Guarantee
and (iii) the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (the Equity Commitment
Agreement and the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, collectively, the "
_Financing Letters_ ") (and corresponding fee letters relating to the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters redacted only in respect of specific fee amounts
and specific "flex" terms, none of which affect the conditionality,
availability or amount of the Debt Financing available on the Closing Date or
remedies available with respect thereto) from the Debt Financing Sources,
pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have agreed to provide, severally
and not jointly, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Debt
Financing (such Debt Financing, together with the Equity Financing,
collectively referred to as the " _Financings_ "). The Company is an express
third-party beneficiary with respect to, and is entitled to specifically
enforce, the Equity Commitment Agreement.

  



  

   

 26

 



    



  

(b)  On the Closing Date, assuming receipt of the proceeds of
the Financings in accordance with the terms of the Financing Letters, Parent
will have sufficient available funds to pay the Aggregate Merger
Consideration and any other cash amounts payable pursuant to, or in connection
with the Transaction, including any obligations of the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries that become due or payable by the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with, or as a result
of, the Transactions, and payment of all fees and expenses related to the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Financing Uses_ ").

  



  

(c)  The Financing Letters and Limited Guarantee have not been
terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect as
of the date of this Agreement. The Equity Commitment Agreement and the
Limited Guarantee are legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the
parties thereto (other than the Company), enforceable against such parties in
accordance with their terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
The Debt Financing Commitment Letters represent valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other
party thereto, to provide the Debt Financing, enforceable against such party
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other
Contracts or arrangements relating to the Financings other than as expressly
contained in the Financing Letters and delivered to the Company prior to the
date hereof, in each case, that would affect the availabiltiy of the Debt
Financing or make the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur. As of
the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent, Sub or Guarantor under any term of, or a failure of any
condition under, the Financing Letters or otherwise result in any portion of
the Financings contemplated thereby to be unavailable on the Closing Date.
 There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the availability
of the Financings, other than the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(with respect to the Equity Financing) and those explicitly set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters (the " _Financing Conditions_ ") with
respect to the Debt Financing. No event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default
on the part of Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
under the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantee or would result in the
failure of a Financing Condition. Each of Parent and Sub has no reason to
believe that it or any other party to the Financing Letters will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term thereof. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financings other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters.

  



    

 27

 



    



  

(d)  Neither Parent nor Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered
into an exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or
binding understanding with any bank or investment bank or other potential
provider of debt or equity financing that prohibits such provider from
providing or seeking to provide services, including debt or equity financing,
to any third person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with the making of any
Competing Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.08   _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent and Sub have caused the Guarantor to deliver the Limited
Guarantee, dated as of the date hereof, to the Company. The Limited Guarantee

 33

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 5.03(b)_, if
prior to the Stockholders' Meeting (i) the Company receives a _bona fide_
written Competing Proposal from a person that did not result from a material
breach of _Section 5.03(a)_, which Competing Proposal is made on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Stockholders' Meeting, and
(ii) the Company's board of directors or a duly authorized committee thereof
(the " _Company Board_ ") determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Competing Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing Proposal and its
representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding such
Competing Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company (w) will not,

event within 48 hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Competing Proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal and shall disclose to Parent the material terms of any

the identity of any person making such Competing Proposal or the terms
thereof) (such notice, including the material terms of such Competing
Proposal, a " _Competing Proposal Notice_ "), (y) will keep Parent informed
in all material respects on a prompt basis of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding such Competing Proposal, including by
updating the Competing Proposal Notice to reflect any updated terms of the
Competing Proposal, and (z) will as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within 24 hours thereafter) provide to Parent any information concerning the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other
person (or its representatives) that was not previously provided or
made available to Parent. So long as the Company and the Company
Representatives have otherwise complied with this _Section 5.03_, none of
the foregoing shall prohibit the Company or the Company Representatives from
contacting any person or group of persons that has made a Competing Proposal
after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Competing
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach of this _Section 5.03_.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.03(d)_ or _Section

advisable the adoption of any Competing Proposal, (ii) following the public
announcement of a Competing Proposal, at the written request of Parent, fail
to reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days

once as to each Competing Proposal unless the price contemplated by such
Competing Proposal is increased), (iii) following the commencement of a
tender offer or exchange relating to the Shares by a person unaffiliated with
Parent, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation and recommend that the
Company's stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within ten
(10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange
offer, or (iv) withhold, change, modify, amend or otherwise propose publicly
to withdraw, change, modify, amend, in each case, in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action set forth in the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ , a " _Change of Company Recommendation_ ")
or (v) allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to
any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions.

  



  

   

 34

 



    



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

  



  

(i)  (A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a
material breach of _Section 5.03(a)_) is made to the Company after the date
hereof by a third person and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and (B)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

  



  

(ii)  the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the
Company's intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a " _Notice
of Change of Recommendation_ ") no less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Company Board making a Change of Company Recommendation, which notice
shall identify the person making such Superior Proposal and include the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that
neither the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company
nor the public announcement that the Company Board has received or is
evaluating a Competing Proposal, in and of itself, shall constitute a Change
of Company Recommendation);

  



  

(iii)  the Company has (to the extent requested by Parent)
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent during such three (3) Business Days
prior to making such Change of Company Recommendation (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two-
day period from the date of such notice); and

  



  

(iv)  taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement offered by Parent in writing to the Company, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were to be given effect.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board may
make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

  



  

(i) there shall occur or arise after the date of this
Agreement a material development or material change in circumstances (or if
such material development or material change in circumstances occurred or
arose on or prior to the date of this Agreement, the material consequences of
which are not known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and
only become known to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time), in each
case, that was not reasonably foreseeable and that relates to the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries but does not relate to any Competing Proposal (as to
which _Section 5.03(d)_ shall apply) (any such material development or
material change in circumstances unrelated to an Competing Proposal
being referred to as an " _Intervening Event_ ");

  



  

   

 35

 



    



  

(ii)  the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent would, if this Agreement were
not amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into,
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary obligations to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law;

  



  

(iii)  the Company provides Parent a Notice of Change of
Recommendation, which notice shall describe the Intervening Event (it being
agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by
the Company nor the public announcement that the Company Board is considering
making a Change of Company Recommendation under applicable Law shall
constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

  



  

(iv)  the Company has (to the extent requested by Parent)
negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least three Business Days
following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of Recommendation; and

  



  

(v)  taking into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement offered by Parent in writing to the Company, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
obligations to the Company's stockholders under applicable Law in light of
such Intervening Event.

  



  

(f)  Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ shall prohibit
the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the
stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that a position disclosed pursuant to
_clause (i)_ shall not be deemed a Change of Company Recommendation if it
includes either an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or
an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation and _provided further_
that the Company or the Company Board may not effect a Change of
Recommendation except as permitted by Section 5.03(d) or (e).

Section 5.04 _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such a
manner as not to interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company,
to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and
(b) furnish promptly such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries
as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any
Company Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such information to the
extent that the Company believes in good faith after consultation with legal
counsel that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a
loss of attorney-client privilege); (ii) violate any
confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
third person or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any then effective
Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party (provided
that the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to share such information with Parent); (iii)
result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving
information that is competitively sensitive; or (iv) breach, contravene or
violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law).
Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective representatives, to hold all information provided or furnished
pursuant to this _Section 5.04_ confidential in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit to the business or property
sites of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and
Sub shall, and shall cause their respective representatives accessing such
properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the Company's and
the Company Subsidiaries' safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.04_, from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of their

Section 5.07   _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a)   _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, to the extent provided in the
organizational documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date hereof, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against (i) all losses, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages
or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding
sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the extent that they are based on
or arise out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "),
and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise
out of or pertain to the Transactions, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in
enforcing such person's rights under this _Section 5.07_. In the event of
any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not
asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties
promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such
Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final
and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

  



  

(b)   _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to
the Effective Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of
six years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy. If the Company and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of
at least six years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
of this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies
as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims
brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being
adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement.

  



    

 39

 



    



  

(c)   _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.07_.

  



  

(d)   _Continuation_. For not less than six years from and after
the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
(or other similar documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are
currently set forth in the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws or the
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The contractual
indemnification rights set forth in the indemnification agreements, the form
of which is filed as an exhibit to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, with any of the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following
the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)   _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Party's heirs, executors or
administrators and each Indemnified Party's representatives, shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without
the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and
heirs) affected thereby.

  



  

(f)   _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.07_, is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any
rights to directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.07_ is not prior to, or
in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Financing and the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive financing agreements with respect to the Debt Financing that
are on terms and conditions (including the market "flex" provisions) no less

available in respect of the Debt Financing, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letters (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to provide the
cooperation described in _Section 5.08(c)_), including the payment of any
commitment, engagement, or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt
Financing, (iv) consummate or cause to be consummated the Debt Financing at
or prior to the date that the Closing is required to be effected in accordance
with  _Section 1.02_ (Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a
condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the
Merger, for Parent and Sub to obtain the Debt Financing or any alternative
financing), and (v) comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters.
Subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the Financing Conditions,
Parent and Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing Sources to provide the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Parent
shall make available to the Company copies of all documents relating to the
Debt Financing upon the Company's reasonable request (subject to the
confidentiality provisions therein) and shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of material developments
in respect of the financing process relating thereto upon the
Company's reasonable request. The documents relating to the Debt Financing
will not contain any conditions to the availability of the Debt Financing on
the Closing Date other than the Financing Conditions.

  



  

(iii)  Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Company, agree to, or permit, any amendment or
modification of, or waiver or consent under, the any Commitment Letter or
other documentation relating to the Financings which would (i) reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Parent or Sub's ability to consummate the

of the Financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent and

interests of the Company) the conditions precedent to the Financings as set
forth in the Financing Letters, or (iv) reasonably be expected to delay the

least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in each case as
reasonably requested by Parent at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date;

  



  

(iv)  assist Parent in obtaining surveys, legal opinions from
local outside counsel and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent
or Sub for the Debt Financing;

substance satisfactory to Parent;

  



  

(vii)  cause the taking of corporate and other actions by the
Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the consummation

any debt securities or commercial bank or other credit facilities (excluding
the indebtedness and/or obligations contemplated by or otherwise permitted
under the Debt Financing Commitment Letters) by or on behalf of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; and

  



  

(x)  supplement the written information (other than
information of a general economic or industry-specific nature) concerning the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby to the
extent that any such information contains any material misstatement of fact
or omits to state any material fact necessary to make such information, taken
as a whole, not misleading in any material respect promptly after gaining
knowledge thereof.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 5.08(a)(i)_, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require any
cooperation or other action to the extent it would materially interfere with
the business or operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries;
(ii) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to commit to take any action that is not contingent upon the Closing

the board of directors (or other governing body) of any of the Company
Subsdiaries shall not be required to approve any financing or agreements

incur any other liability or obligation or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financings or any action taken in accordance
with _Section 5.08(a)(i)_ at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Company Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Financings
(including any action taken in accordance with _Section 5.08(a)(i)_) and any
information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
condition set forth in _Section 6.02(b)_, as it applies to the
Company's obligations under this _Section 5.08_, shall be deemed satisfied
regardless of any breach by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries of
their obligations under this _Section 5.08_ unless the Company has materially
breached this _Section 5.08_ and the result of such breach is that Parent is
unable to obtain the Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented and reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with this _Section 5.08_.

efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit the Transactions and (b) if any
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the

Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the

commission opportunities (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity
incentive compensation) to each individual who is an employee of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and who
continues such employment immediately thereafter (each, a " _Company
Employee_ ") at a rate that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the rate of base salary, wages or commission opportunities provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual
bonus opportunity to each Company Employee that is substantially comparable in
the aggregate to the annual cash-based bonus opportunity provided to such

in the aggregate to the severance benefits provided under the severance plan,
policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) other benefits (including
paid-time off, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity incentive
compensation) to each Company Employee that are substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit
Plans.

  



  

(b)  Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.10(a)_, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of
the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' employment, severance, retention
and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
(provided that any change in control, severance, retention and termination
plans, policies and agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary

Benefit Protection Period shall do so without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply

and, with respect to vacation and severance only, determination of level of
benefits (under any "employee benefit plan" (as such term is defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to whether the applicable plan is
subject to ERISA) and any other employee benefit plan, program, policy
or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, (other than any equity based compensation plan, long-
term incentive plan, defined benefit pension plan or retiree health or welfare
plan) each Company Employee's service with or otherwise credited by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation to the same
extent such service was recognized under the analogous Company Benefit Plan
as of the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits.

  



  

   

 44

actively at work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will
be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the
extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-
work requirements and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of
all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such
year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall (i) be treated as the establishment of or an amendment of any
Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement, (ii) give any employee or former employee or any other
individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee
thereof or any other third person any right to enforce the provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan, except in
accordance with the terms of such plan, or (B) retain the employment of any
particular employee for any duration.

  



  

Section 5.11   _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger and the other Transactions, shall be paid by the

Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the Transactions are exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  



  

   

 45

 



    



  

Section 5.13   _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall promptly
advise Parent of any litigation commenced after the date of this Agreement
against the Company or any of its directors by any Company stockholders (on
their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) to the extent relating to this

delayed or conditioned.

  



  

Section 5.14   _Preparation of the Proxy Statement: Stockholders '
Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than July 21, 2017 (as long as Parent
has complied with its obligation to cooperate with the Company set forth in
this Section 5.14(a)), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company with the
preparation of the foregoing. The Company, with Parent's cooperation, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff
concerning the Proxy Statement. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement in
definitive form to be mailed to the Company's stockholders, in each case as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement will be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to an Competing Proposal, a Superior
Proposal, a Change of Company Recommendation or any matters relating thereto.
Each of Parent and Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection
with the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly
furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all information
relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under
applicable Law. Parent agrees that such information supplied by it in writing
for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will
not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the
time of the Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or its
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, Parent shall promptly notify the Company so that it may file with
the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement
to the stockholders of the Company. The Company agrees that the Proxy
Statement will not, on the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the
Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact

include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent and subsequently file with the SEC an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminate such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company.

give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to consider
the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " _Stockholders ' Meeting_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening the Stockholders'
Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum,
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Company's stockholders prior to the Stockholders' Meeting or (iv) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder
Approval.

Company Board to make a Change of Company Recommendation pursuant to _Section

that all percentages therein shall be changed to "50%".

  



  

(c)   _Reverse Termination Fee; Effect of Certain Terminations_.

  



  

(i)  In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated

Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(b)_ at a time when the Company had the right

 51

 



    



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement (including this _Section 7.02_), but subject to the Company's
rights set forth in _Section 8.10_, the parties agree that the Company's
right to terminate this agreement and receive payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee or seek damages pursuant to Section 7.02(c)(ii) subject
to the IB Cap, as applicable, in accordance with this _Section 7.02(c)_
shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any and all losses or
damages suffered or incurred by the Company or its affiliates or any other
person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination of this
Agreement), the Merger and the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, and the Company, on
behalf of itself and each Company Related Party hereby waives any claim or
other remedy against Parent, Sub and their respective Affiliates and their
respective members, partners, controlling persons, stockholders, affiliated

shall Parent be required to pay more than one of (A) the Reverse Termination
Fee, (B) damages pursuant to _Section 7.02(c)(ii)_ , and (C) damages pursuant

Fee but such Reverse Termination Fee is not paid within the two (2) Business
Day period specified in _Section 7.02(c)(i)_, the Company shall retain all
of its rights pursuant to this Agreement (including, prior to the termination
of this Agreement, pursuant to _Section 8.10_). So long as this
Agreement shall not have been terminated, the Company shall be entitled to
pursue both a grant of specific performance under _Section 8.10_ and the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 7.02(c)_, but under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive more than
one of (i) a grant of specific performance under _Section 8.10_, (ii) the
Reverse Termination Fee, (iii) damages payable pursuant to
_Section 7.02(c)(ii)_ , or (iv) damages pursuant to _Section 8.10(d)_.

  



  

(e)  Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i)
the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company
would not enter into this Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required
to pay to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.02(b)_. In the event that Parent receives full payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.02(b)_ under circumstances where a
Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, any of their
respective affiliates or any other person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination of this Agreement), the Merger and the Transactions (and
the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

  



  

Section 7.03   _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 5.07(e)_, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Sub by action taken by or
on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires approval by
the holders of Shares without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 5.08_, _7.02_ , _7.03_ , _8.06_ ,
_8.08_ and  _8.10_ of this Agreement (and any other provision of this
Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of the foregoing as it applies to any
Debt Financing Source Related Party) and the definitions related thereto
(solely as used in such sections) (collectively, the " _Lender Designated
Sections_ ") may not be amended in a manner adverse to the interests of any

the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties of the other contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of
the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval,
there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement that decreases the
Merger Consideration or that adversely affects the rights of the holders of
Shares hereunder without the approval of the holders of Shares at a duly
convened meeting of the holders of Shares called to obtain approval of such
extension or waiver. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement

Indemnified Party's representatives, Parent, Sub and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in
this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other parties, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not

persons named in _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ of this sentence shall be entitled
to enforce their rights under this Agreement. The parties further agree that
the rights of third-party beneficiaries under _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ of the
preceding sentence shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties may be subject to
waiver by the parties in accordance with _Section 7.04_ without notice or

of the parties. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely
upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this

Section 8.10   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or
were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to _Section 7.02_,
the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and (ii) the
provisions set forth in _Section 7.02_ are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any party's right to specific performance or other equitable relief.
If on the Outside Date, there is a pending Proceeding that has been brought
by a party hereto seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
8.10_, then, without further action, the Outside Date shall be automatically
extended until the date that is five Business Days after the dismissal,
settlement or entry of a final non-appealable order with respect to such
Proceeding or such other time period established by the court presiding over
such Proceeding.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including _Section 8.10(a)_), it is acknowledged and agreed that, prior to
a valid termination of the Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.01_, the
Company shall be entitled to obtain specific performance to cause Parent and
Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing
in accordance with _Section 1.02_ only if: (i) all of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but each of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing and
is reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the Closing) on the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.02_, (ii) the
Debt Financing contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing, (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written
notice to Parent (and shall not have purported to revoke such notice) that
(A) all conditions set forth in _Section 6.01_ and _Section 6.02_ have
been satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than those conditions which, by
their nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and (B)
if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof are funded, the Company
stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section
1.02_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled
to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent's obligations to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the Transactions if the Debt
Financing contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof has not been
funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is
funded at the Closing).

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
but subject to _Section 8.10(d)_ and _Section 7.02_ (solely in the case when
this Agreement is terminated), the Company hereby agrees that, prior to the
Closing, specific performance as provided for in this _Section 8.10_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Sub in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) and that it may not seek
or accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under this
Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including monetary damages).

  



  

(d)  If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to
specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to cause the Equity Financing
to be funded and to consummate the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.02_
pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.10(b)_ at a time when the conditions set forth in the first
sentence of _Section 8.10(b)_ are satisfied and has instead granted an award
of damages for such alleged breach of Parent's obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing in accordance with 
_Section 1.02_ , the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for
such alleged breach only if, within ten (10) Business Days following such
determination (i) the Company confirms to the Parent in writing that the
Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing pursuant to
_Section 1.02_ (whether or not this Agreement has previously been
terminated), and (ii) Parent does not consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of such
written confirmation in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, under no circumstances will the Company or any of its
Affiliates be entitled to enforce such an award or accept damages for such
alleged breach in excess of $25,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "); provided, further,
that prior to enforcing any such award or accepting any such damages for such
alleged breach, the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Related
Parties irrevocably waives any and all rights to receive or seek (i) payment
of the Reverse Termination Fee and (ii) damages pursuant to _Section
7.02(c)(ii)_.

  



  

   

 58

 



    



  

(e) Each of the parties agrees that except as provided in
_Section 7.02(d)_ and _Section 8.10(d)_ (i) the seeking of remedies pursuant
to this _Section 8.10_ shall not in any way constitute a waiver by any party
seeking such remedies of its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to it under this Agreement, including under _Section 7.02_, in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 8.10 _are not available or otherwise
are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require a
party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit a party's right to institute
any Proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 8.10_ prior, or
as a condition, to exercising any termination right under _Article VII_, nor
shall the commencement of any Proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this
_Section 8.10 _or anything set forth in this _Section 8.10_ restrict or
limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of _Article VII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may
be available then or thereafter and (iii) no party shall require the other to
post any bond or other security as a condition to institute any Proceeding for
specific performance under this _Section 8.10_. While the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent permitted by
this _Section 8.10_ and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or
damages as provided by _Section 7.02(c)(ii)_ , under no circumstances shall
the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific
performance (or damages contemplated pursuant to _Section 8.10(d)_ ) and the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or damages pursuant to
_Section 7.02(c)(ii)_.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties
hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source or any
Debt Financing Source Related Party, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, and the Company on behalf of itself and the Company
Related Parties agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or
otherwise terminate) any Proceeding against any Debt Financing Source or any
Debt Financing Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Proceeding related to the
Debt Financing). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, it is
agreed that no Debt Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source Related
Party shall have any liability for any losses to the Company or any Company
Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related
Party be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement
against any Debt Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source Related Party.
Nothing in this _Section 8.10_ shall in any way limit or qualify the
liabilities of the Debt Financing Sources or the Debt Financing Source
Related Parties and the other parties to the Debt Financing to each other
thereunder or in connection therewith.

  



  

Section 8.11   _Attorneys ' Fees_. In any action at law or suit in
equity to enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties
hereunder, the prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to
receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys' fees and all other reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit.

2.   

  



  

(a) Each person who has been or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a
person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including,
without limitation, service with respect to employee benefit plans
(hereinafter an " _Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is an
alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee
or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to
the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, or any other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expenses, liability and loss (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall
continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as
provided in paragraph (b) of this Article Fifth, Section 2 with respect to
proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if
such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of
the Corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article
Fifth, Section 2 shall be a contract right. In addition to the right of
indemnification, an Indemnitee shall have the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance
of its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any other applicable law,
requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or
her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in
advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Article Fifth, Section 2 or otherwise.

  



  

  

(b) If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Article Fifth,
Section 2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a
written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at
any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It
shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to
enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required,
has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the
standard of conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware, or any other applicable law, for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of
the Corporation (including, without limitation, its board of directors,
stockholders or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior
to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is
proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including, without limitation, its board of directors, stockholders
or independent legal counsel) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

   

A-2

 



    



  

  

(c)  The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses
incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition
conferred in paragraph (b) of this Article Fifth, Section 2 shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

(d)  The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against
such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, or any other applicable law.

  



  

(e)  The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to
time by the board of directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights
to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of
the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this
Article Fifth, Section 2 with respect to the indemnification and advancement
of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

  



  

(f)  Any repeal or modification of this Article Fifth, Section
2 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification.

  



  

Sixth.

  



  

1.  The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Corporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.
