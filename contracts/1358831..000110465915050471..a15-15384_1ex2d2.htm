with respect to) all Property Costs incurred at and after the Effective Time.
Seller shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to
Leases, Units and Wells prior to the Effective Time (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and
shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all
Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time. "Earned" and "incurred",
as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and Council of
Petroleum Accountants Society (COPAS) standards. "Property Costs" means all
costs attributable to the ownership or operation of the Assets (including
costs of insurance and ad valorem, property, severance, Hydrocarbon production
and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation of the
Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding any other
Taxes) and capital expenditures incurred in the ownership and operation of the
Assets in the ordinary course of business and, where applicable, in accordance
with the relevant operating or unit agreement, if any, and overhead costs
charged to the Assets under the relevant operating agreement or unit
agreement, if any, or, if none, the amounts shown under **Schedule 1.4**

sales, gathering or transportation contracts, (v) gas balancing obligations
and (vi) obligations to pay working interests, royalties, overriding royalties
or other interests held in suspense, all of which are addressed in **Article
11**. For purposes of this **Section 1.4**, determination of whether Property
Costs are attributable to the period before or after the Effective Time shall
be based on when services are rendered, when the goods are delivered, or when
the work is performed. For clarification, the date an item or work is ordered
is not the date of a pre-Effective Time transaction for settlement purposes,
but rather the date on which the item ordered is delivered to the job site, or
the date on which the work ordered is performed, shall be the relevant date.
For purposes of allocating Hydrocarbon production (and accounts receivable
with respect thereto), under this **Section 1.4**, (i) ** ** liquid
Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the Properties
when they pass through the pipeline connecting into the storage facilities
into which they are run and (ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be
"from or attributable to" the Properties when they pass through the delivery
point sales meters on the pipelines through which they are transported. Seller
shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation
of Hydrocarbon production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping
data is not available. Seller shall provide to Purchaser, no later than five
(5) Business Days prior to Closing, all data necessary to support any
estimated allocation, for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 2.2** hereof that will be used to
determine the Closing Payment (as defined in **Section 9.4(a)**). Taxes,
right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and other Property Costs that are paid
periodically shall be prorated based on the number of days in the applicable
period falling before and the number of days in the applicable period falling
at or after the Effective Time, except that Hydrocarbon production, severance
and similar Taxes shall be prorated based on the number of units actually
produced, purchased or sold or proceeds of sale, as applicable, before, and at
or after, the Effective Time. In each case, Purchaser shall be responsible for
the portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective Time and Seller
shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period before the
Effective Time.

 



 

 **Section 1.5** **_Delivery and Maintenance of Records_** **.**

 



 

(a) At Purchasers cost: (i) Seller shall use reasonable efforts to make
electronic copies of the Records available to Purchaser on or before the
Closing out of Sellers Quorum Land System and accounting systems and (ii)
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with any conversion of the Records that is reasonably necessary to
integrate such Records into Purchasers systems, _provided_ , _however_ , that
any delay, failure or inability to effect such conversion or integration shall
not delay the Closing hereunder. Seller shall maintain and make available to
Purchaser at Closing any originals of the Records located on the Properties or
the lands covered by the Surface Contracts at the location at which they are
currently held. Seller may retain original Records of certain items as set
forth in **Section 1.2(j) **and/or copies of any Records. Upon Purchasers
written request following the Closing, Seller shall provide Purchaser with
access to all of the original Records in Sellers possession.

 



 

(b) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years following Closing, will (i)
retain electronic copies of the Records, (ii) provide Seller, its Affiliates,
and its and their officers, employees and representatives with access to the

access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to
materials received or produced after Closing relating to any Indemnity Claim

4.2(d)(i)**;

 



 

(e) Reduced by an amount equal to all cash in suspense accounts relative to
the Assets for which Purchaser has assumed responsibility under **Section
11.3**;

 



 

(f) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs attributable
to the ownership and operation of the Assets paid by Seller and incurred at or
after the Effective Time (including any overhead costs under **Schedule 1.4
**deemed charged to the Assets with respect to the Adjustment Period even
though not actually paid), except any Property Costs and other such costs
already deducted in the determination of proceeds in **Section 2.2(a)**;

 



 

(g) Increased or reduced as agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser;

 



 

(h) Increased by the amount of merchantable Hydrocarbons stored in tanks above
the pipeline connection and in pipelines upstream of the sales meter
attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets that belong to
Seller as of the Effective Time; and

 



 

(i) If an aggregate Imbalance relative to the Assets exists as of the
Effective Time based upon the information in **Schedule 5.16** and any
available subsequent balancing statements, excluding the Disputed Imbalance,
the Purchase Price shall be increased if the Assets are under-produced, or
decreased if the Assets are over-produced, (A) in the case of gas, by the
product of (i) the amount (measured in thousand cubic feet "Mcf") of such
Imbalance (excluding the Disputed Imbalance), and (ii) $3.50 per Mcf, or (B)
in other cases, by an amount agreed to in writing by the Parties.

 



 

Each adjustment made pursuant to **Section 2.2(a)** shall serve to satisfy,
up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchasers entitlement under **Section
1.4** to Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during
the Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period,
and as such, Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any
Hydrocarbon production or income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect
to which an adjustment has been made. Similarly, the adjustment described in
**Section 2.2(d)** shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the
adjustment, Purchasers obligation under **Section 1.4** to pay Property
Costs and other costs attributable to the ownership and operation of the
Assets which are incurred during the Adjustment Period, and as such, Purchaser
shall not be separately obligated to pay for any Property Costs or other such
costs with respect to which an adjustment has been made.

 



 

 **Section 2.3** **_Allocation of Purchase Price for Tax Purposes_** **.**

 



 

Within 30 days of the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller will
agree upon an allocation of the unadjusted Purchase Price (and other amounts
that may be required to be taken into account) among the Assets, in compliance
with the principles of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), and the Treasury regulations thereunder (any such agreed
allocation, the "Purchase Price Allocation"). Any adjustments to the Purchase
Price pursuant to **Section 2.2** or otherwise shall be applied to the
Purchase Price Allocation as required pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In the event Seller and Purchaser have
agreed on a Purchase Price Allocation, Seller and Purchaser will be deemed to
have accepted such Purchase Price Allocation for

 



      
 

 



 

purposes of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, but
otherwise make no representation or warranty as to the accuracy of such
values. In the event Seller and Purchaser have agreed on a Purchase Price
Allocation, Seller and Purchaser further agree (i) that the Purchase Price
Allocation shall be used by Seller and Purchaser as the basis for reporting
asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and local Tax
Returns, including without limitation Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and
(ii) that neither they nor their Affiliates will take positions inconsistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation in notices to Governmental Bodies or in
audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required
by Law.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** **_Deposit_** **.**

 



 

Within one Business Day following the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser
will pay to Seller an earnest money deposit in an amount equal to seven and
one half percent (7.5%) of the Purchase Price (the "Deposit"). The Deposit
shall be non-interest bearing and applied against the Purchase Price if the
Closing occurs or shall be otherwise distributed in accordance with the terms
of **Section** **10.3** of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
TITLE MATTERS**

 



 

 **Section 3.1** **_Seller s Title_** **.**

 



 

(a) Except for the special warranty of title referenced in **Section 3.1(b)**
and in the Term Royalty Deed and without limiting Purchasers right to adjust
the Purchase Price by operation of this **Article 3**, Seller makes no
warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
respect to Sellers title to any of the Assets and Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Purchasers sole remedy for any defect of title,
including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (i) before the
Closing, shall be Purchasers right to adjust the Purchase Price to the extent
provided in this **Article 3** and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to
the special warranty of title referenced in **Section 3.1(b)** and in the
Term Royalty Deed. The right of Purchaser to assert a Title Defect under this
Agreement shall terminate as of the Defect Claim Date, _provided_ there shall
be no termination of Purchasers or Sellers rights under **Section 3.4**
with respect to any bona fide Title Defect properly reported in a Title Defect
Notice or bona fide Title Benefit properly reported in a Title Benefit Notice
on or before the Defect Claim Date.

 



 

(b) The conveyance to be delivered by Seller to Purchaser shall be
substantially in the form of **Exhibit D** hereto (the "Conveyance"), which
includes a special warranty of Defensible Title by, through and under Seller,
but not otherwise, to the Properties shown on **Exhibit A-1** or **Schedule
1.2(e)(i)** , but shall otherwise be without warranty of title of any kind,
express, implied or statutory or otherwise.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under Sellers special
warranty of title in the Conveyance against any Title Defect reported under
this **Article 3** and/or any Title Defect disclosed to Purchaser prior to
the Defect Claim Date.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title
Defect under this **Article 3** results from any matter which could also
result in the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in
**Article 5**, then Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter
(i) before Closing, as a Title Defect to the extent permitted

 



      
 

 



 

by this **Article 3**, or (ii) after Closing, as a breach of Sellers special
warranty of title contained in the Conveyance to the extent permitted by this
**Section 3.1**, and shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as
the basis of the breach of any such representation or warranty.

 



 

 **Section 3.2** **_Definition of Defensible Title_** **.**

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" means that record title
of Seller with respect to the Wells shown in **Exhibit A-1** that, except for
and subject to Permitted Encumbrances:

 



 

(a) entitles Seller to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and
marketed from those formations in which such Well is currently completed
and/or those depths or formations identified in **Exhibit A-1 **throughout
the duration of the productive life of such Well (after satisfaction of all
royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests or other similar
burdens on or measured by production of Hydrocarbons) (a "Net Revenue
Interest"), of not less than the Net Revenue Interest shown in **Exhibit
A-1** for such Well, except (i) decreases in connection with those operations
in which Seller may after the date of this Agreement be a non-consenting co-
owner in compliance with **Section 7.6**, (ii) decreases resulting from the
reversion of interests to co-owners relating to non-consent elections made
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with **Section 7.6**, farmouts

compliance with **Section 7.6**, (iii) decreases resulting from the
establishment or amendment after date of this Agreement of pools or units in
compliance with **Section 7.6**, (iv) decreases required to allow other
working interest owners to make up past underproduction or pipelines to make
up past under deliveries, and (v) except as stated in such **Exhibit A-1**;

 



 

(b) obligates Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to, not greater than
the "working interest" shown in **Exhibit A-1** for such Well, in each case
relating to those formations in which such Well is currently completed and/or
those depths or formations identified in **Exhibit A-1 **and without increase
throughout the productive life of such Well, except (i) as stated in **Exhibit
A-1**, (ii) increases resulting from contribution requirements with respect to
non-consenting co-owners under applicable operating agreements and (iii)
increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in
Sellers Net Revenue Interest; and

pledges, defects in title or other similar defects.

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" with respect to the

surface estate therein that, except for and subject to Permitted Encumbrances,
is free and clear of liens, encumbrances, obligations, security interests,
pledges, defects in title or other similar defects.

 



 

 **Section 3.3** **_Definitions of Title Defect and Title Benefit_** **.**

 



 

As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Defect" means any lien,

Defensible Title in and to the Wells shown in **Exhibit A-1**

 



      
 

 



 

or the Surface Fee Lands shown in **Schedule 1.2(e)(i).** As used in this
Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" means any right, circumstance or condition
that operates to increase the Net Revenue Interest of Seller in any Well shown
in **Exhibit A-1**, without causing a greater than proportionate increase in
Sellers working interest above that shown in **Exhibit A-1**.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title
Defects:

 



 

1. defects based solely on (i) lack of information in the Sellers files or (ii) references to a document(s) if such document(s) is not in Sellers files;

 



 

2. defects in the chain of title prior to January 1, 1950;

 



 

3. defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity authorization if the signatory had apparent authority unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that the action was not authorized and has resulted in another partys actual and superior claim of title to the relevant Property;

 



 

4. defects based on failure to record Leases issued by the federal government, or any assignments of record title or operating rights in such Leases, in the real property, conveyance or other records of the county in which such Property is located;

 



 

5. defects based on a gap in Sellers chain of title in the county records as to the Leases, unless such gap is affirmatively shown to exist in such records by an abstract of title, title opinion or landmans title chain which documents shall be included in a Title Defect Notice;

 



 

6. defects that have been cured by applicable Laws of limitations or prescription;

 



 

7. any delay in delivering an assignment earned under a farmout, participation or similar agreement unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that the farmor or other third party record title holder has refused to deliver such assignment;

9. defects in the chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of heirship or estate proceedings prior to January 1, 1950, unless Purchaser provides affirmative evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in another Persons superior claim of title to the relevant Asset.

 



 

 **Section 3.4** **_Definition of Permitted Encumbrances_** **.**

 



 

As used herein, the term "Permitted Encumbrances" means any or all of the
following:

 



 

(a) Royalties and any overriding royalties, reversionary interests and other

without a corresponding increase in the Net Revenue Interest;

 



 

(b) All Leases, unit agreements, pooling agreements, operating agreements,

subordinate to the applicable Lease;

 



 

(h) Rights of reassignment arising upon final intention to abandon or release
all or any of the Assets;

 



 

(i) Easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other

individually reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interest below that shown in
**Exhibit A-1** or increase Sellers working interest above that shown in
**Exhibit A-1** without a corresponding increase in Net Revenue Interest or
materially affect or interfere with the ownership, use, operation or value of
the Assets subject thereto;

 



 

(j) Calls on Hydrocarbon production under existing Contracts;

 



 

(k) All rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Body to control or
regulate any of the Assets in any manner or to assess Tax with respect to the

permit issued by any such Governmental Body;

 



 

(l) Any encumbrance on or affecting the Assets that is discharged by Seller at
or prior to Closing;

 



 

(m) Any other liens, charges, encumbrances, defects or irregularities that do
not, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect or interfere with the
use, ownership, operation or value of the Assets subject thereto or affected
thereby (as currently used, owned or operated), which would be accepted by a
reasonably prudent purchaser engaged in the business of owning and operating
oil and gas properties, and which do not reduce Sellers Net Revenue Interest
below that shown in **Exhibit A-1**, or increase Sellers working interest

Date or those depths or formations identified on **Exhibit A-1 **for such
Well; and

 



 

(r) Any lack of pooling or communitization agreements and lack of approval of
a spacing unit for (i) a Well that is otherwise subject to a production
sharing or similar agreement or (ii) a Well in which one or more co-tenants is

Interest set forth on **Exhibit A-1**.

 



 

 **Section 3.5** **_Notice of Title Defect Adjustments_** **.**

 



 

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim notices
to Seller (each a "Title Defect Notice") no later than 5:00 p.m. Central Time
on the Defect Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser will use
reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Time each
Friday prior to the expiration of the Defect Claim Date, notice (which notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the expiration of the
Defect Claim Date and the failure to deliver any such preliminary notice shall
not constitute a waiver of any Title Defect) of all Title Defects discovered
by Purchaser during the preceding week. Each Title Defect Notice shall be in
writing and shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s),
(ii) the Wells, the non-producing formations or depths identified in **Exhibit
A-1** for any such Wells (if applicable) or Surface Fee Lands affected by the
Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of
each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for
Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify
the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and (v) the amount by which
Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Defect
Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the computations and
information upon which Purchasers belief is based, including any analysis by
any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived its right to assert any Title Defects for which a Title Defect Notice
has not been delivered on or before the Defect Claim Date. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Allocated Value" means the portion of the Purchase
Price that has been allocated to (A) a Well in **Exhibit A-1**, (B) the
additional depths or formation identified in **Exhibit A-1** with respect to
a particular Well or (C) the Surface Fee Lands in **Schedule 1.2(e)(i)**.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser on or before the Defect Claim Date with respect to each Title
Benefit a notice, if any (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a
description of the Title Benefit, (ii) the Wells affected, (iii) the Allocated
Values of the Wells subject to such Title Benefit, (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Purchaser to verify the existence of the alleged
Title Benefit, and (v) the amount by which the Seller reasonably believes the
Allocated Value of those Wells is increased by the Title Benefit, and the
computations and information upon which Sellers belief is based. Seller shall
be deemed to have waived its right to assert any Title Benefits for which a
Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or before the Defect Claim
Date.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees that it will not compensate any third party consultants,
attorneys or landmen used to review title to the Assets on a contingent or
incentive payment basis based on the aggregate Title Defect Amounts asserted
or adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove prior to the Closing any Title Defects properly
asserted prior to the Defect Claim Date (the "Asserted Title Defects").
Purchaser shall not be entitled to any remedies for Asserted Title Defects
that Seller has cured prior to the Closing.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Title Defects_. With respect to Asserted Title Defects that
have not been cured prior to the Closing and for which Seller and Purchaser
agree upon (i) the validity of the Asserted Title Defect and (ii) the Title
Defect Amount, then, subject to the Individual Title Deductible and the
Aggregate Title Deductible, Seller may elect one of the following remedies,
which will constitute the Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for the
Asserted Title Defect:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) indemnify Purchaser against all liability, loss, cost and expense
resulting from such Asserted Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Parties, _provided_ that
Seller may not elect this remedy without Purchasers consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld; or

 



 

(iii) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Asserted Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

 



 

(f) _Treatment of Title Benefits_. With respect to each Well affected by a
Title Benefit properly reported under **Section 3.4(b)**, there shall be an
offset to the Title Defect Amounts in an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount")
equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Well caused by such
Title Benefit, as determined pursuant to **Section 3.5(i).**

 



 

(g) _Limitations_. In no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase
Price or other remedies provided by Seller (i) for individual Asserted Title
Defects that do not exceed $25,000.00 ("Individual Title Deductible"); and
(ii) until the aggregate amount of the Title Defect Amounts for all such
Asserted Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Deductible, excluding
any Asserted Title Defects cured by Seller, exceeds one percent (1%) ** ** of
the Purchase Price (the "Aggregate Title Deductible"), after which point
Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies elected by Seller only to the extent the sum of the Title Defect
Amounts for such Asserted Title Defects exceeds the Aggregate Title
Deductible. An individual claim for a Title Benefit shall only generate an
offset to the Title Defect Amounts if the Title Benefit Amount exceeds
$25,000.00.

 



 

(h) The "Title Defect Amount" resulting from an Asserted Title Defect shall be
the amount by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property affected
by such Title Defect is

 



      
 

 



 

reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and shall be
determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Asserted Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which
is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Asserted Title Defect from the
Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if the Asserted Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the
Net Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest stated on **Exhibit A-1**, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the
denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on **Exhibit A-1**;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any discrepancy in a
reversionary Net Revenue Interest, the Title Defect Amount shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect the likely economic effect of the Title
Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iv) if the Asserted Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance,
burden or charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of
a type not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect
Amount shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by
the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic
effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the
values placed upon the Asserted Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such
other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing considerations notwithstanding, in the event
the Asserted Title Defect is reasonably susceptible of being cured without
reliance on any third party consent or approval, the Title Defect Amount shall
not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing such Asserted
Title Defect; and

 



 

(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this **Article 3**, (A) the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Asserted
Title Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of the Title Defect Property, (B) the Title Defect Amount with respect
to an Asserted Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any
costs or losses included in any other Title Defect Amount hereunder or of any
amounts for which Purchaser otherwise receives credit in the calculation of
the Adjusted Purchase Price and shall be calculated in a manner that is net to
Sellers interest in the applicable Title Defect Property and (C) with respect
to a Title Defect Property that is the non-producing depths or formations
identified in **Exhibit A-1** for a particular Well, the Title Defect Amount
for any Asserted Title Defect shall not exceed the Allocated Value set forth
on **Exhibit A-1** for such non-producing depths or formations.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Well multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of which is
the Net Revenue Interest stated on **Exhibit A-1**. Any offset adjustments to
the Title Defect Amounts pursuant to **Section 3.5(f)** shall be made and
accounted for at the time of the Closing unless the existence of the Title
Benefit or calculation of the Title Benefit Amount is in dispute, in which
case, any offset adjustments to the Title Defect Amounts resulting from such
dispute shall be made and accounted for in the final calculation of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 9.4**.

 



 

(j) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Asserted Title Defects,
Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts prior to the
Closing. Any Asserted Title Defects, Title Defect Amounts, Title Benefits and
Title Benefit Amounts that remain unresolved by the Closing and, with respect
to Asserted Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts, for which Seller has not
elected one of the remedies in **Section 3.5(e)** ("Disputed Title Matters")
shall be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following
provisions. Any Asset subject to a Disputed Title Matter shall be conveyed to
the Purchaser at Closing without reduction to the Purchase Price, and any
adjustments to the Purchase Price resulting from the expert determination
shall be reflected in the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to **Section 9.4**. Any initiation of expert determination following
the Closing shall only be in accordance with the following provisions.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than fifteen (15) days
following the Closing, a written description meeting the requirements of
**Section** **3.5(a)** or **Section 3.5(b)**, as applicable, together with
all supporting documentation, of each Disputed Title Matter. By not later than
seven (7) Business Days after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written
description of the Disputed Title Matters, as applicable, Seller shall provide
to Purchaser a written response setting forth Sellers position with respect
to the Disputed Title Matters, as applicable, together with all supporting
documentation.

 



 

(ii) Within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of Sellers response,
Purchaser may initiate the expert determination procedures by delivering
written notice to Seller identifying the Disputed Title Matters Purchaser
wishes to have resolved by expert determination (the "Expert Determination
Notice"). There shall be a single title expert (the "Title Expert"), who shall
be a title attorney with at least twenty (20) years experience in oil and gas
titles involving properties in the regional area in which the Properties are
located, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller within five
days after Purchaser initiates the expert determination procedures. Absent
such agreement, the Parties shall request that the Houston office of the
American Arbitration Association select a Title Expert who is a neutral title
attorney with at least twenty (20) years experience in oil and gas titles
involving properties in the regional area in which the Properties are located
and that, neither such attorney nor his firm represents and has not within the
previous two (2) years represented either Party.

 



 

(iii) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the applicable
Title Expert, the Parties shall submit one copy to the applicable Title Expert
of (i) a copy of this **Article 3**, the Allocated Values of the affected
Assets

 



      
 

 



 

and a copy of the defined terms used in this **Article 3**, but no other
provisions of this Agreement, (ii) Purchasers written description of the
Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents that were
provided to Seller, (iii) Sellers written response to Purchasers written
description of the Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting
documents that were provided to Purchaser and (iv) the applicable Expert
Determination Notice. The Title Expert shall resolve the Disputed Title
Matters based only on the foregoing submissions and any additional information
requested by the Title Expert. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the
right to submit additional documentation to the applicable Title Expert unless
requested by the Title Expert nor to demand discovery on the other Party.

 



 

(iv) The Title Expert, once appointed, shall have no _ex parte_
communications with any Party concerning the determination required hereunder.
All communications between any Party and the Title Expert shall be conducted
in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party in the same
manner, or at a meeting in Houston, Texas, to which the representatives of
both Parties have been invited and of which such Parties have been provided at
least five days notice.

 



 

(v) In making its findings, the Title Expert shall be bound by and shall
resolve any dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the State of
Texas, except that the Title Expert shall not be bound by rules of evidence
and may consider any documentation it determines is relevant and credible.
Additionally, the Title Expert may consult with and engage disinterested third
parties to advise the Title Expert, including petroleum engineers.

 



 

(vi) The Title Experts determination shall be made within fifteen (15)
Business Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. The written finding of
the Title Expert will set forth the Title Experts finding as to whether the
subject Title Defect exists or has been cured and the resulting Title Defect
Amount, or the existence of the asserted Title Benefit and corresponding Title
Benefit Amount, including the Title Experts rationale for the award. With
respect to a Title Defect Amount (or Title Benefit Amount), the Title Expert
shall be limited to awarding only the final Title Defect Amount (or Title
Benefit Amount) proposed by a Party in its submissions provided pursuant to
**Section 3.5(j)(i)**. The Title Expert shall make a separate and independent
determination with respect to each Title Defect (or Title Benefit) submitted
and shall provide a detailed written finding supporting such determination.

 



 

(vii) The Title Expert shall act as an expert, and not as an arbitrator, for
the limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed Title Matters
submitted by the Parties and may not award damages, interest or penalties to
either Party with respect to any matter. The Parties intend that the
procedures set forth in this **Section 3.5(j)** shall not constitute or be
handled as arbitration proceedings under the Federal Arbitration Act or any
applicable state arbitration act, and that the provisions of this **Section
3.5(j)** shall be specifically enforceable. Seller and Purchaser shall each
bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its case. Each Party
shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Expert, including
any costs incurred by the Title Expert that are attributable to

 



      
 

 



 

such third party consultation. The Title Experts decision shall be reflected
in the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to **Section
9.4**.

 



 

 **Section 3.6** **_Casualty or Condemnation Loss_** **.**

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in
the condition of the Assets from the Effective Time until Closing for
production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including the watering
out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well) and the
depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear.

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of **Section 8.1(f)** and **Section 8.2(f)**
hereof, if, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date,
any portion of the Assets is affected by Casualty Losses or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of
such all such Casualty Losses or takings exceeds ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price, in the aggregate, then Seller shall elect by written notice to
Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the Assets affected by any
Casualty Loss or taking to be repaired or restored to at least its condition
prior to such Casualty Loss, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii) indemnify
Purchaser against all liability, loss, cost and expense incurred by Purchaser
to remedy the Casualty Loss pursuant to an indemnity agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Parties, _provided_ that Seller may not
elect this remedy unless Purchaser has agreed to accept such indemnity
agreement or (iii) to treat such Casualty Loss or taking as a Title Defect
with respect to the affected Property or Properties under **Section 3.5**. In
each case, Seller shall retain all rights to insurance and other claims
against third parties with respect to the Casualty Loss or taking except to
the extent the Parties otherwise agree in writing.

 



 

(c) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is affected by Casualty Losses or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of
such all such Casualty Losses or takings is less than or equal to ten percent
(10%) of the Purchase Price, in the aggregate, Purchaser shall nevertheless be
required to close and Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid
to Seller by third parties by reason of such Casualty Loss or taking and shall
assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of
Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid
awards, and other rights against third parties (other than Affiliates of
Seller and its and their directors, officers, employees and agents) arising
out of the casualty or taking.

 



 

 **Section 3.7** **_Customary Post-Closing Consents Respecting Assets_**
**.**

 



 

(a) _Federal and State Approvals_. Purchaser, within thirty (30) days after
Closing, shall file for approval with the applicable Governmental Bodies all
assignment documents and other state and federal transfer documents required
to effectuate the transfer of the Assets. Purchaser further agrees promptly
after Closing to take all other actions reasonably required of it by
Governmental Bodies having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory
approvals with respect to this transaction, and to use its reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain the approval by such Governmental Bodies, as
applicable, of Sellers assignment documents requiring approval from such
Governmental Body in order for Purchaser to be recognized by such Governmental
Body as the owner of the Assets. Purchaser shall provide Seller with the
resignation and designation of operator

 



      
 

 



 

instruments, and approved copies of the assignment documents and other state
and federal transfer documents, as soon as they are available.

 



 

(b) _Title Pending Governmental Approvals_. Until all of the approvals of
Governmental Bodies provided for in **Section 3.7(a)** have been obtained,
the following shall occur with respect to the affected portion of the Assets:

 



 

(i) Seller shall continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets as nominee for Purchaser;

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for all Assumed Obligations with respect
to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets as if
Purchaser was the record owner of such Leases and other portion of the Assets
as of the Effective Time; and

 



 

(iii) Seller shall act as Purchasers nominee but shall be authorized to act
only upon and in accordance with Purchasers instructions, and Seller shall
have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of
the Assets other than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in
nature, unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Purchaser in
writing.

 



 

(c) _Denial of Required Governmental Approvals_. If the Governmental Body
fails to provide approval within twenty-four (24) months after the Closing,
Seller may continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and other
affected Assets as Purchasers nominee or at Sellers option it may terminate
this Agreement and all its obligations hereunder as to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets by giving sixty (60) days written notice
to Purchaser. Upon such termination: (i) this Agreement shall be null and void
and terminated as to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the
Assets, (ii) Purchaser shall immediately reassign and return to Seller the
assignment documents and any and all other documents, materials and data
previously delivered to Purchaser with respect to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets and deliver such Assets to Seller free
and clear of all burdens, liens or encumbrances created by, though or under
Purchaser, and (iii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Allocated Value of the
affected Property, without interest, less the proceeds of Hydrocarbon
production received by Purchaser (which shall be retained by Purchaser as its
sole property) net of all expenses, costs, capital expenditures, overhead,
royalties, and costs of operations (including plugging and abandonment
expenses but excluding mortgage interest and any burdens, liens, or
encumbrances created by Purchaser) attributable to the affected Leases or
other affected portion of the Assets from the Effective Time forward.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

 **Section 4.1** **_Assessment_** **.**

 



 

Prior to the Defect Claim Date, upon prior written notice to Seller, Purchaser
shall have the right to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment of all
or any portion of the Properties (the "Assessment"), which shall be conducted
by TRC Companies, Inc. The Assessment shall be conducted at the sole cost and
expense of Purchaser, and shall be subject to the indemnity provisions of
**Section 4.3** and **Section 11.4(b)(v)**. Purchaser may not operate

 



      
 

 



 

equipment or conduct any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive
investigative activity with respect to the Properties ("Invasive Activity")
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in
Sellers sole discretion. If Purchaser wishes to conduct an Invasive Activity,
Purchaser shall furnish for Sellers review and approval (which may be
withheld in Sellers sole discretion) a proposed scope of such Invasive
Activity, including a description of the activities to be conducted and a
description of the approximate locations of such activities. Seller shall have
the right to be present during any Assessment of the Properties and shall have
the right, at its option and expense, to split samples with Purchaser, if
applicable. The access granted to Purchaser under this **Section 4.1** shall
be limited to Sellers or applicable third party operators normal business
hours or as otherwise agreed in advance, and Purchasers investigation shall
be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the operation of the
Assets. Purchaser shall abide by Sellers, and any third party operators,
safety rules, regulations, and operating policies (including the execution and
delivery of any documentation or paperwork, _e.g._ , confidentiality
agreements or liability releases, required by third party operators with
respect to Purchasers access to any of the Assets) while conducting its due
diligence evaluation of the Assets. After completing any Assessment of the
Properties, Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and expense, restore the
Properties to their condition prior to the commencement of such Assessment,
unless Seller requests otherwise, and if Seller permits Purchaser to conduct
an Invasive Activity, shall promptly dispose of all drill cuttings, corings,
or other investigative-derived wastes generated in the course of such Invasive
Activity. Purchaser shall maintain, and shall cause its officers, employees,
representatives, consultants and advisors to maintain, all information
obtained by Purchaser pursuant to any Assessment or other environmental due
diligence activity (the "Environmental Information") as strictly confidential
in perpetuity, unless disclosure of any facts discovered through such
Assessment is required, on the advice of counsel, under any Environmental
Laws, other Laws, or to comply with any subpoena, court or administrative
order, or, following the Closing, any contractual or legal obligation of
Purchaser. If requested in writing by Seller prior to Closing, Purchaser shall
provide Seller with a copy of the final draft of all environmental reports
prepared by, or on behalf of, Purchaser with respect to any Assessment or
permitted Invasive Activity conducted on the Properties. In the event that any
necessary disclosures under applicable Environmental Laws are required, upon
the advice of counsel, with respect to matters discovered by any Assessment
conducted by, for or on behalf of Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that Seller
shall be the responsible party for disclosing such matters to the appropriate
Governmental Bodies.

 



 

 **Section 4.2** **_Environmental Defects_** **.**

 



 

(a) To assert a claim of an Environmental Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim
notices to Seller (each an "Environmental Defect Notice") no later than 5:00
p.m. Central Time on the Defect Claim Date; _provided, however_ , that
Purchaser will use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before 5:00 p.m.
Central Time each Friday prior to the expiration of the Defect Claim Date,
notice (which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to
the expiration of the Defect Claim Date and the failure to deliver any such
preliminary notice shall not constitute a waiver of any Environmental Defect)
of all Environmental Defects discovered by Purchaser during the preceding week
to give Seller an opportunity to commence reviewing possible Environmental
Defects. Each Environmental Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall
include: (i) a description of the alleged Environmental Defect(s) and, if
applicable, the Environmental Law violated or compelling Remediation; (ii) the
Wells or Surface Fee Lands affected by the Environmental Defect (each an
"Environmental Defect Property"), (iii) the Allocated Value of each
Environmental Defect Property as set forth on **Exhibit A-1** or **Schedule
1.2(e)(i)** , (iv) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller, as
well as any

 



      
 

 



 

environmental consultant or attorney hired by Seller, to verify the existence
of the alleged Environmental Defect and (v) Purchasers good faith, non-
binding estimate of the reasonable costs necessary to correct or Remediate
each Environmental Defect (the "Purchaser Environmental Defect Estimate"),
including the method, analysis and information Purchaser, or any environmental
consultant or attorney hired by Purchaser, used in calculating such the
Purchaser Environmental Defect Estimate. For any Environmental Defect relating
to the presence or release of Hazardous Materials, Purchaser shall calculate
its Purchaser Environmental Defect Estimate of potential Remediation costs
consistent with the Lowest Cost Response where the extent of the release or
presence is reasonably determinable from the Environmental Information.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to assert any Environmental
Defects for which an Environmental Defect Notice has not been delivered on or
before the Defect Claim Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may not
assert any Environmental Defect relating to the Disclosed Environmental
Conditions.

 



 

(b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove, consistent with applicable Environmental Laws,
any Environmental Defects properly asserted prior to or on the Defect Claim
Date (the "Asserted Environmental Defects"), which work may extend after the
Closing Date for a period of 180 days so long as such work is commenced within
60 days following the Closing and is diligently prosecuted by Seller
thereafter. Purchaser shall not be entitled to any remedies for Asserted
Environmental Defects that Seller has cured to Purchasers reasonable
satisfaction consistent with applicable Environmental Laws.

 



 

(c) If Seller agrees with the Purchaser Environmental Defect Estimate for any
Asserted Environmental Defect, then the "Environmental Defect Amount"
resulting from such Asserted Environmental Defect shall be the Purchaser
Environmental Defect Estimate for such Asserted Environmental Defect. If
Seller does not agree with the Purchaser Environmental Defect Estimate for any
Asserted Environmental Defect, then the "Environmental Defect Amount"
resulting from such Asserted Environmental Defect shall be the reasonable
costs necessary to correct or Remediate such Asserted Environmental Defect as
determined in accordance with **Section 4.2(f)** and/or **Section 4.2(g)**.

 



 

(d) With respect to Asserted Environmental Defects that Seller has not elected
to cure and for which Seller and Purchaser agree upon the validity of the
Asserted Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect Amount, then,
subject to the Individual Environmental Deductible and the Aggregate
Environmental Deductible, Seller may elect one of the following remedies,
which will constitute Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for the Asserted
Environmental Defect:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental Defect Amount, and
Purchaser shall thereafter assume all responsibility (including any
Environmental Liability) related to such Environmental Defect;

 



 

(ii) indemnify Purchaser against any Environmental Liability asserted against
or incurred by Purchaser resulting from such Asserted Environmental Defect
pursuant to an indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Parties, _provided_ that Seller may not elect this remedy without
Purchasers consent, not to be unreasonably withheld; or

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property that is subject
to such Asserted Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, in
which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property.

 



 

(e) In no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller (i) for individual Asserted Environmental Defects
that do not exceed $25,000.00 ("Individual Environmental Deductible") and (ii)
until the aggregate amount of the Environmental Defect Amounts for all such
Asserted Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual Environmental
Deductible, excluding any Asserted Environmental Defects cured by Seller,
exceeds one percent (1%) ** ** of the Purchase Price (the "Aggregate
Environmental Deductible"), after which point Purchaser shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies elected by Seller only to
the extent the sum of the Environmental Defect Amounts for such Asserted
Environmental Defects exceeds the Aggregate Environmental Deductible.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event the
Environmental Defect Amount with respect to any Environmental Defect Property
exceeds the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property, then
Purchaser shall have the right to exclude such Environmental Defect Property
from this Agreement in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced at
Closing by the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property affected
by such Environmental Defect.

 



 

(f) Seller and Purchaser shall in good faith attempt to agree on the validity
of Asserted Environmental Defects and, for Asserted Environmental Defects for
which Seller does not agree with the Purchaser Environmental Defect Estimate,
the Environmental Defect Amount, if any, of the Asserted Environmental Defects
using the following criteria:

 



 

(i) In the case of Environmental Defects relating to the presence or release
of Hazardous Materials and where reasonably determinable from the available
Purchaser Environmental Information, the Environmental Defect Amount shall be
based upon the Lowest Cost Response to Remediate such Environmental Defect or
otherwise cause the applicable Environmental Defect Properties to comply with
Environmental Law or the applicable Lease or Contract in either case
discounting at eight percent (8%) per annum all expenditures reasonably
necessary more than one (1) year after the Closing. Where the Lowest Cost
Response is not reasonably determinable from available Purchasers
Environmental Information, the Environmental Defect Amount shall be a
commercially reasonable estimate of expected costs for Seller to Remediate
such Environmental Defect or otherwise cause the applicable Environmental
Defect Properties to comply with Environmental Law or the applicable Lease or
Contract.

 



 

(ii) It is the intent of the Parties that any adjustment made pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to each Environmental Defect shall be made only once
and without duplication of any costs or losses included in another asserted
Environmental Defect.

 



 

(iii) The Parties acknowledge that the Environmental Defect Amount may exceed
the Allocated Value of the Environmental Defect Property.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Any Asserted Environmental Defects and Environmental Defect Amounts that
remain unresolved by the Closing and for which Seller has not elected one of
the remedies in **Section 4.2(d)** ("Disputed Environmental Matters") shall
be exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following
provisions. Any Asset subject to a Disputed Environmental Matter shall be
conveyed to the Purchaser at Closing without reduction to the Purchase Price,
and any adjustments to the Purchase Price resulting from the expert
determination shall be reflected in the final calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 9.4**. Any initiation of expert
determination following the Closing shall only be in accordance with the
following provisions:

 



 

(i) Following the Closing, Purchaser may conduct such further investigation of
the Properties affected by such Disputed Environmental Matters as Purchaser
deems reasonably necessary to assess the existence of or to better evaluate,
as applicable, such Disputed Environmental Matter, including, in the case of
Environmental Defects relating to the presence or release of Hazardous
Materials, the Lowest Cost Response, which information shall be timely shared
with Seller. Purchaser will promptly give notice to Seller of its intent to
conduct further investigation of the Properties in accordance with this
**Section 4.2(g)(i)** and a description of which Disputed Environmental
Matters are the subject of such investigation.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than fifteen (15) days
following the later of completion of any such further investigations by
Purchaser in accordance with **Section 4.2(g)(i)** and the Closing, a written
description meeting the requirements of **Section 4.2(a)**, together with all
supporting documentation, of each Disputed Environmental Matter. By not later
than seven (7) Business Days after Sellers receipt of Purchasers written
description of the Disputed Environmental Matters, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser a written response setting forth Sellers position with respect to
the Disputed Environmental Matters, together with all supporting
documentation;

 



 

(iii) Within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of Sellers response,
Purchaser may initiate the expert determination procedures by delivering
written notice to Seller an Expert Determination Notice identifying the
Disputed Environmental Matters Purchaser wishes to have resolved by expert
determination. There shall be a single environmental expert (the
"Environmental Expert"), who shall be an environmental consultant with at
least twenty (20) years experience in environmental corrective action of oil
and gas properties in the regional area in which the Properties are located,
as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Seller within five (5) days
after the Purchaser initiates the expert determination procedures. Absent such
agreement, the Parties shall request that the Houston office of the American
Arbitration Association select the Environmental Expert who is an
environmental consultant with at least twenty (20) years experience in
environmental corrective action of oil and gas properties in the regional area
in which the Properties are located and so long as neither such consultant nor
his firm is engaged, and has not within the previous two (2) years been
engaged, by either Party.

 



 

(iv) Within three (3) Business Days following the selection of the applicable
Environmental Expert, the Parties shall submit one copy to the applicable
Environmental Expert of (i) a copy of this **Article 4**, the Allocated

 



       
 

 



 

Values of the affected Assets and a copy of the defined terms used in this
**Article 4**, but no other provisions of this Agreement, (ii) Purchasers
written description of the Disputed Environmental Matters, together with the
supporting documents that were provided to Seller, (iii) Sellers written
response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed Environmental
Matters, together with the supporting documents that were provided to
Purchaser and (iv) the applicable Expert Determination Notice. The
Environmental Expert shall resolve the Disputed Environmental Matters based
only on the foregoing submissions and any additional information requested by
the Environmental Expert. Neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have the right to
submit additional documentation to the applicable Environmental Expert unless
requested by the Environmental Expert nor to demand discovery on the other
Party.

 



 

(v) The Environmental Expert, once appointed, shall have no _ex parte_
communications with any Party concerning the determination required hereunder.
All communications between any Party and the Environmental Expert shall be
conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other Party in
the same manner, or at a meeting in Houston, Texas, to which the
representatives of both Parties have been invited and of which such Parties
have been provided at least five (5) days notice.

 



 

(vi) In making its findings, the Environmental Expert shall be bound by and
shall resolve any dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the State
of Texas, except that the Environmental Expert shall not be bound by rules of
evidence and may consider any documentation it determines is relevant and
credible. Additionally, the Environmental Expert may consult with and engage
disinterested third parties to advise the Environmental Expert.

 



 

(vii) The Environmental Experts determination shall be made within fifteen
(15) Business Days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be
final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. The written
finding of the Environmental Expert will set forth the Environmental Experts
finding as to whether the Asserted Environmental Defect exists or has been
cured and the resulting Environmental Defect Amount, including the
Environmental Experts rationale for the award. With respect to an
Environmental Defect Amount, the Environmental Expert shall be limited to
awarding only the final Environmental Defect Amount proposed by a Party in its
submissions provided to the Environmental Expert pursuant to **Section
4.2(g)(iv)**. The Environmental Expert shall make a separate and independent
determination with respect to each Environmental Defect submitted and shall
provide a detailed written finding supporting such determination.

 



 

(viii) The Environmental Expert shall act as an expert, and not as an
arbitrator, for the limited purpose of determining the specific Disputed
Environmental Matters submitted by the Parties and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. The Parties
intend that the procedures set forth in this **Section 4.2(g)** shall not
constitute or be handled as arbitration proceedings under the Federal
Arbitration Act or any applicable state arbitration act, and that the
provisions of this **Section 4.2(g)** shall be specifically enforceable.
Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half

 



      
 

 



 

of the costs and expenses of the Environmental Expert, including any costs
incurred by the Environmental Expert that are attributable to third party
consultation. The Environmental Experts decision shall be reflected in the
final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 9.4**.

 



 

 **Section 4.3** **_NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_** **.**

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration,
development, and production of Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Properties or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain asbestos, hazardous substances, or NORM.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on the Properties or included in the Assets may contain NORM and other
wastes or hazardous substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes
or hazardous substances may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required
for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, hazardous substances, and NORM from the
Assets.

 



 

 **Section 4.4** **_Inspection Indemnity_** **.**

 



 

 **PURCHASER HEREBY AGREES TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, RELEASE, PROTECT, SAVE AND
HOLD HARMLESS THE SELLER INDEMNITEES, SELLERS VENTURERS, IF ANY, AND ITS AND
THEIR INVITEES AND INSURERS AND CONTRACTORS, AND ANY THIRD PARTY OPERATORS
FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
ANY DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY PURCHASER OR ITS AGENTS ON THE
PROPERTIES, WHETHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING
ANY LOSSES RESULTING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, FROM THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
GROSS, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT
OR VIOLATION OF LAW BY THE SELLER INDEMNITEES OR THIRD PARTY OPERATORS.**

 **Section 5.1** **_Generally_** **.**

 



 

(a) Any representation or warranty qualified "to the knowledge of Seller" or

circumstance in question.

 



 

(b) Inclusion of a matter on a Schedule to a representation or warranty which
addresses matters that are material or matters having a Material Adverse
Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter is, or may be,
material or does, or may, have a Material Adverse Effect. Likewise, the
inclusion of a matter on a Schedule in relation to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an indication that such matter

 



      
 

 



 

necessarily would, or may, breach such representation or warranty absent its
inclusion on such Schedule. Matters may be disclosed on a Schedule to this
Agreement for purposes of information only.

 



 

(c) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this **Section 5.1**, the

will be duly executed and delivered by Seller) and this Agreement constitutes,
and at the Closing such documents will constitute, the valid and binding
obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their
terms except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or
other similar laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally as
well as to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



 

 **Section 5.5** **_No Conflicts_** **.**

 



 

Except for Customary Post-Closing Consents and the Preference Rights and
Required Consents set forth in **Schedule 5.13**, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Seller, and the transactions contemplated by

contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 5.7** **_Litigation_** **.**

 



 

Except as set forth in **Schedule 5.7**, no investigation, proceeding,

delivered by Purchaser at Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.7** **_Financing_** **.**

 



 

Purchaser has sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of

Except for the representations and warranties expressly made by Seller in
**Article 5 **of this Agreement, the Conveyance or Term Royalty Deed, or in
any certificate furnished or to be furnished to Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, Purchaser represents and acknowledges that (a) Seller and its
Affiliates and its and their respective equity owners, members,
representatives, officers, employees or agents have not made and are not
making any representations or warranties of any kind or nature whatsoever,
oral or written, express, statutory or implied, with respect to Seller, the
Assets or the prospects thereof and (b) Purchaser has not relied upon any oral
or written information provided by any such Person. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser represents and acknowledges that Seller
has not made, and disclaims, any representation or warranty regarding any
matter or circumstance relating to Environmental Laws, Environmental
Liabilities, the release of Hazardous Materials or NORM into the environment
or protection of human health, safety, natural resources or the environment or
any other environmental condition of the Assets. Purchaser further represents
and acknowledges that it is knowledgeable of the oil and gas business and of
the usual and customary practices of producers such as Seller and that it has
had access to the Assets, the officers and employees of Seller, and the books,
records and files of Seller relating to the Assets, and in making the decision
to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, Purchaser has relied solely on the basis of its own independent due
diligence investigation of the Assets, except to the limited extent of the

5** herein, in the Conveyance or Term Royalty Deed, and in any certificate
required to be executed and delivered by Seller at the Closing.

 



 

 **Section 6.9** **_SEC Disclosure; Investment Experience_** **.**

continue to maintain, lease bonds, area-wide bonds or any other surety bonds

regulations governing the ownership and operation of such leases.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** **_Access_** **.**

 



 

Between the date of execution of this Agreement and continuing until the
Closing, Seller will give Purchaser and its representatives access to the
Assets and access to the Records in Sellers possession, for the purpose of
conducting an investigation of the Assets and copying the Records, subject to
the additional terms and conditions set forth in **Article 4** but only to
the extent that Seller may do so without violating any obligations to any
third party and to the extent that Seller has authority to grant such access
without breaching any restriction binding on Seller. Such access by Purchaser
shall be limited to Sellers normal business hours, and any weekends and after
hours requested by Purchaser that can be reasonably accommodated by Seller,
and Purchasers investigation shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes
interference with the operation of the Assets. All information obtained by
Purchaser and its representatives under this Section shall be subject to the
terms of **Section 11.4(b)(v) **and the terms of that certain confidentiality
agreement between Seller and Purchaser dated March 9, 2015, as amended (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

 



 

 **Section 7.2** **_Government Reviews_** **.**

 



 

Seller and Purchaser shall in a timely manner (a) make all required filings,
if any, and prepare applications to and conduct negotiations, with each
Governmental Body as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are
necessary or appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the HSR Act, (b) provide such information as each may
reasonably request to make such filings, prepare such applications and conduct
such negotiations, and (c) request early termination or waiver of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Each Party shall cooperate with
and use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other with respect
to such filings, applications and negotiations.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** **_Notification of Breaches_** **.**

 



 

Until the Closing,

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Seller prior to or on the Closing Date has not been
so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



 

(b) Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly after Seller obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement is untrue in any material respect or will be untrue in any material
respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be
performed or observed by Purchaser prior to or on the Closing Date has not
been so performed or observed in any material respect.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) If any of Purchasers or Sellers representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchasers or Sellers
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but
if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the
date set forth in **Section 10.1**), then such breach shall be considered not
to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** **_Letters-in-Lieu; Assignments; Operatorship_** **.**

 



 

(a) Seller will execute on the Closing Date letters in lieu of division and
transfer orders relating to the Assets on forms prepared by Purchaser and
reasonably satisfactory to Seller to reflect the transaction contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(b) If applicable, Seller will prepare and Seller and Purchaser will execute
on the Closing Date all assignments necessary to convey to Purchaser all
Leases in the form as prescribed by the applicable Governmental Body and
otherwise reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller.

 



 

(c) Seller makes no representations or warranties to Purchaser as to the
transferability or assignability of operatorship of any Seller Operated
Assets. Rights and obligations associated with operatorship of such Properties
are governed by operating and similar agreements covering the Properties and
will be decided in accordance with the terms of such agreements. However,
Seller will assist Purchaser in its efforts to succeed Seller as operator of
any Wells included in the Assets. Purchaser shall, promptly following Closing,
file all appropriate forms and declarations or bonds with Governmental Bodies
relative to its assumption of operatorship. For all Seller Operated Assets,
Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser and Purchaser shall promptly
file the appropriate forms with the applicable Governmental Bodies

 **Section 7.5** **_Public Announcements_** **.**

 



 

Until the Closing, neither Party shall make any press release or other public
announcement regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
disclosures by Purchaser or Seller which are (a) necessary, upon advice of
counsel, for such disclosing Party to comply with applicable securities or
other Laws or regulations or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates or (b) necessary for
a Party to perform this Agreement (including disclosures to Governmental
Bodies, a Partys attorneys, lenders or financial advisors; _provided_ such
advisors are obligated to keep such information confidential, or third parties
holding preferential rights to purchase, rights of consent or other rights
that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as
reasonably necessary to provide notices, seek waivers, amendments or
termination of such rights, or seek such consents); and _provided further_
that Purchaser may disclose the existence and contents of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby to the Standard and Poors and Moodys
rating agencies (provided that such agencies are obligated to keep such
information confidential). At or after Closing, the content of any press
release or public announcement shall be subject to the prior review and
reasonable approval of Seller and Purchaser.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser
is required to make a public announcement and filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission regarding this Agreement and the Midstream Purchase
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including
filing said agreements. Purchaser will provide Seller with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon such public announcement and filing,
including all exhibits thereto (and will consider Sellers reasonable comments
timely made thereto) prior to their release.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** **_Operation of Business_** **.**

 



 

Except as set forth on **Schedule 7.6**, until the Closing, Seller (a) will
operate its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practices as
a reasonably prudent operator, (b) will not, without the prior written consent
of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed, commit to any operation, or series of related operations, reasonably
anticipated by Seller to require future capital expenditures by the owner of
the Assets in excess of $200,000.00, net to Sellers working interest, or make
any capital expenditures in excess of $200,000.00, net to Sellers working
interest, or voluntarily terminate, materially amend or extend any Material
Contract, (c) will maintain insurance coverage on the Assets presently
furnished by nonaffiliated third parties in the amounts and of the types
presently in force, (d) will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all Leases, (e) will maintain all material
Governmental Authorizations, (f) will not transfer, farmout, sell,
hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any material Assets or material
rights related thereto, except for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbon
production and obsolete or worn out Equipment made in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices, (g) will not commit to do any of the
foregoing, (h) will not resign as operator of the operated Assets, (i) without
Purchasers written consent, will not make any non-consent elections with
respect to operations affecting any of the Assets, and (j) will promptly give
Purchaser notice of any written notice claiming any default or violation
received or given by Seller under any Lease, Contract or Law affecting any
Asset that would reasonably be expected to be material to the Assets, taken as
a whole. Purchasers approval of any action restricted by this **Section
7.6** shall be considered granted within ten (10) days (unless a shorter time
is reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified
in Sellers written notice) of Sellers notice to Purchaser requesting such
consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the contrary in writing during
that period. In the event of an emergency, Seller may take such action as a
prudent operator would take and shall notify Purchaser of such action promptly
thereafter.

 



 

Purchaser acknowledges that Seller may own an undivided interest in certain
Assets and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working
interest owners who are not affiliated with Seller shall not constitute a
violation of the provisions of this **Section** **7.6** nor shall any action
required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a violation so
long as Seller has voted its interest in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this **Section 7.6**.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 7.7** **_Preference Rights and Required Consents_** **.**

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall initiate all procedures which in
Sellers good faith judgment are reasonably required to comply with or obtain
the waiver of all Preference Rights, Required Consents and other consent to
assignment with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any out-
of-pocket cost or expense or incur any liability for the benefit of) the
holder of any Preference Right, Required Consent or other consent to
assignment in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.

 



 

(b) The portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to any Asset or portion
thereof affected by a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") or that
becomes a Retained Asset shall be the Allocated Value thereof. If a Preference
Property or a Retained Asset affects only a portion of a Property and a
portion of the Purchase Price has not been allocated specifically to such
portion of a Property in **Exhibit A-1** or in **Schedule 1.2(e)(i)** , then
the portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to such Preference Property
or Retained Asset shall be determined in a reasonable manner taking into
account the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) that the portion of
such Property affected by such Preference Property or Retained Asset bears to
the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire Property. Any
Preference Property or Retained Asset that is a Property shall include a pro
rata share of all of Sellers right, title and interest in, to and under all
Contracts, Surface Contracts, Equipment, Hydrocarbon production and Records
included in the Assets that are directly related or attributable to such
Preference Property or Retained Asset.

 



 

(c) If the holder of a Preference Right who has been offered a Preference
Property pursuant to **Section 7.7(a)** elects prior to Closing to purchase
such Preference Property in accordance with the terms of such Preference
Right, and Seller and Purchaser receive written notice of such election prior
to the Closing, such Preference Property will be excluded from the Assets and
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price
allocated to such Preference Property pursuant to **Section 7.7(b)**. Except
as provided in **Section 7.7(d)**, if the holder of a Preference Right who
has been offered a Preference Property or who has been requested to waive its
Preference Right pursuant to **Section 7.7(a)** does not elect to purchase
such Preference Property or waive such Preference Right with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement prior to the Closing Date and the
time in which the Preference Right may be exercised has not expired, such
Preference Property shall be conveyed to Purchaser at Closing subject to the
rights, if any, of the holder of such Preference Right. In such event, Seller
shall continue its efforts to obtain the waiver of such Preference Rights to
the extent provided in **Section 7.7(a)** and Purchaser shall cooperate with
such efforts. If the holder of a Preference Right elects to purchase a
Preference Property subject to its Preference Right and Closing has already
occurred with respect to such Preference Property, Purchaser shall be
obligated to comply with such Preference Right to the extent, if any, that the
same remains valid and enforceable with respect to this transaction and
Purchaser shall be entitled to the consideration for the sale of such
Preference Property from Purchaser to such Preference Right holder.

 



 

(d) If (i) a third party brings any suit, action or other proceeding prior to
the Closing seeking to restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby in connection with a claim to enforce
a Preference Right; or (ii) an Asset is subject to a Required Consent that is
not waived, complied with or otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied prior to the Closing Date, then, unless otherwise mutually agreed by
Seller and Purchaser, the Asset or portion thereof affected by such Preference
Right or outstanding Required Consent (a "Retained Asset") shall be excluded
from the Assets to be transferred and conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the
Purchase Price to be paid at Closing shall be reduced by the portion of the
Purchase Price allocated to such Retained Asset pursuant to **Section
7.7(b)**. Any Retained Asset so excluded at the Closing will be conveyed to
Purchaser within ten (10) days following the date on which, as applicable (A)
the suit, action or other proceeding, if any, referenced in clause (i) above
is settled or finally determined or (B) the outstanding Required Consent has
been obtained or waived. The date of such transfer shall become the "Closing
Date" with respect to such Retained Asset. At the time of such transfer,
Purchaser shall pay Seller the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced
at Closing on account of the exclusion of such Retained Asset (as adjusted
pursuant to **Section 2.2** through the new Closing Date therefor);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if all Preference Rights and Required Consents
with respect to any Retained Asset are not obtained, complied with, waived or
otherwise satisfied within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing,
then such Retained Asset shall become an Excluded Asset unless Purchaser
agrees to take such Retained Asset, in which case Purchaser shall be deemed to
have waived compliance with such Preference Right or Required Consent and
shall DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY SELLER INDEMNITEES FOR ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THE
HOLDER OF SUCH PREFERENCE RIGHT OR REQUIRED CONSENT RELATED TO ANY ALLEGED
FAILURE TO COMPLY THEREWITH, WHICH OBLIGATIONS SHALL BE ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

(e) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of the Assets and
would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchasers agreement to
purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is expressly
understood and agreed that Seller does not desire to sell any Preference
Property unless the sale of all of the Assets is consummated by the Closing
Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Sellers obligation hereunder to sell the Preference Properties to
Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the Closing Date
of the sale of all of the Assets in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, either by conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an
applicable Preference Right; _provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing herein is
intended or shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to any
portion of the Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby.

 



 

 **Section 7.8** **_Tax Matters_** **.**

Taxes related to the Assets (other than ad valorem, property, severance,
Hydrocarbon production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the
ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons
therefrom, which are addressed in **Section 1.4**) attributable to any period
of time on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall bear all Taxes
related to the Assets (other than ad valorem, property, severance, Hydrocarbon
production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or
operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, which are
addressed in **Section 1.4**) attributable to any period of time after the

payment to the appropriate Governmental Body of all Taxes with respect to the
Assets which are required to be paid on or prior to Closing Date and shall
file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) To the extent Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives a refund of (or
refundable credit against) Taxes for which Seller is responsible hereunder,
other than a refund (or credit) resulting from a carryback of losses or other
items from a period for which Purchaser is responsible hereunder, Purchaser
shall notify and remit to Seller an amount equal to the amount received or
credited promptly upon receipt or credit.

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees to cooperate (at no cost or liability to Purchaser) with
Seller so that Sellers transfer of the Assets to Purchaser shall, at Sellers
election, be accomplished in a manner enabling the transfer to qualify as a
part of a like-kind exchange of property by Seller within the meaning of
Section 1031 of the Code. If Seller so elects, Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller to effect such like-kind exchange, which cooperation
shall include, without limitation, taking such actions as Seller reasonably
requests in order to pay the Purchase Price in a manner which enables such
transfer to qualify as part of a like-kind exchange of property within the
meaning of Section 1031 of the Code, and Purchaser agrees that Seller may
assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to a
qualified intermediary as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii) under United States Treasury Regulations, to qualify
the transfer of the Purchase Price as a part of a like-kind exchange of
property within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code.

 



 

 **Section 7.9** **_Further Assurances_** **.**

 



 

After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to take such further actions

statements of the Assets that Purchaser or Legacy Reserves LP requires to
comply with their tax and financial reporting requirements and audits that may
be required by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act
of 1933 and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which cooperation will
include reasonable access during normal business hours to Sellers employees,
representatives and agents who were responsible for preparing the revenue and
expense statements and work papers and other supporting documents used in the
preparation of financial statements, as may be reasonably required by
Purchasers Auditor to perform an audit in accordance with generally accepted

its obligations under this **Section 7.10**, (iii) such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller or
its Affiliates, (iv) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents, consultants or representatives shall have any
liability for any statement, materials or information provided by Seller or
any such Person in connection with this **Section 7.10** and (v) Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that any financial information provided to Purchaser
pursuant to this **Section 7.10** shall be unaudited at the time it is
provided, and that Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to
provide audited financial information pursuant to this **Section 7.10**.

 



 

 **Section 7.11** **_Employment Matters_** **.**

inconvenient or disruptive to Seller or its Affiliates, with reasonable
advance notice being provided to Seller. It is understood that Purchaser shall
have no obligation to interview or make an offer of employment to any of the
Available Employees. Any offers of employment to Available Employees shall be
in writing (or an electronic document) with an identification of the
employees salary or hourly rate, bonus opportunity, any other incentive
compensation, and benefits. Purchaser shall send to Seller within 5 days after
offers of employment are made a schedule identifying the offers of employment
that were made and whether such offer was for compensation greater than, less
than or equal to the compensation currently being paid to such employee.

shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, based upon the best information
available to Seller, a preliminary settlement statement estimating the
Adjusted Purchase Price after giving effect to all Purchase Price adjustments
provided for in this Agreement. Such estimated Adjusted Purchase Price, less

Seller at the Closing (the "Closing Payment"). Purchaser may notify Seller of
disagreements regarding the calculation of the Closing Payment no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, and the Parties shall in
good faith attempt to resolve any such disagreements without delaying the
Closing. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on all
disputed items prior to the Closing, then the payment due at the Closing shall
nevertheless be based on the calculation of the Closing Payment prepared by
Seller, as adjusted to take into account any items on which the Parties do
reach agreement prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
later of (i) ninety (90) days following the Closing Date and (ii) the date on

setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price and showing
the calculation of each adjustment, based, to the extent possible, on actual
credits, charges, receipts and other items before and after the Effective Time
and taking into account all adjustments provided for in this Agreement. Seller
shall at Purchasers request supply reasonable documentation available to
support any credit, charge, receipt or other item. As soon as reasonably
practicable but not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt of
Sellers statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a written
report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made to such
statement. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the
Adjusted Purchase Price no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date, as may be reasonably extended if all Disputed Title Matters and
Disputed Environmental Matters are not resolved within one hundred twenty
(120) days following the Closing. In the event that the Parties cannot reach
agreement within such period of time, either Party may refer the remaining
matters in dispute to a nationally-recognized independent accounting firm as
may be acceptable to Purchaser and Seller, for review and final determination.
The accounting firm shall conduct the arbitration proceedings in Houston,
Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the
terms of this **Section 9.4**. The accounting firms determination shall be
made within thirty (30) days

 



      
 

 



 

after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding on
both Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper amount of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price, the accounting firm shall not increase the
Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor decrease the
Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as applicable.
The accounting firm shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may
not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case. Each Party shall bear one-half of the costs and
expenses of the accounting firm. Within ten (10) Business Days after the date
on which the Parties or the accounting firm, as applicable, finally determines
the disputed matters relating to the final calculation of the Adjusted
Purchase Price, (x) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the
Adjusted Purchase Price (less the Deposit) exceeds the Closing Payment or (y)
Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds
the Adjusted Purchase Price (less the Deposit), as applicable. Any post-
Closing payment pursuant to this **Section 9.4(b)** shall bear interest at
the Agreed Interest Rate from the Closing Date to the date both Purchaser and
Seller have executed the final settlement statement.

 



 

(c) To the extent the Well Dispute is not resolved by Seller and the
applicable third parties prior to the Closing, Seller may, in its sole
discretion and at its sole cost and expense, pursue and administer all Claims
or causes of action related to the Well Dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller does not make any representations or warranties with respect to the
likelihood or probability of success of such Claims or causes of action. To
the extent Seller elects to pursue such Claims and receives any proceeds in
respect of such Well Dispute, Seller shall be entitled to receive all proceeds
attributable to the period prior to the Effective Time and Purchaser shall be
entitled to receive all proceeds attributable to the period at and after the
Effective Time. Any proceeds received prior to the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to **Section 9.4(b)** shall be included in such
statement and calculation. To the extent Seller does not elect to pursue such
Claims within ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser may pursue
such Claims and receive all proceeds attributable to such Claims, whether
attributable to periods before or after the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing and for a period of 90 days following the Closing,
Seller shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the outstanding claims relating
to the Disputed Imbalance. To the extent the Disputed Imbalance is resolved
within 90 days following the Closing Date, the Purchase Price adjustment
described in **Section 2.2(i)** shall include the final amount of the
Disputed Imbalance determined by such resolution. To the extent the Disputed
Imbalance is not resolved within such time period, then the Purchase Price
adjustment described in **Section 2.2(i)** shall include the original amount
of the unresolved portion of the Disputed Imbalance, calculated as of the
Effective Date. Any adjustments made pursuant to this **Section 9.4(d)**
shall be reflected in the final determination of the Purchase Price pursuant
to **Section 9.4(b)** shall be included in such statement and calculation.

 



 

(e) All payments made or to be made hereunder to Seller shall be by electronic
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank and account as may be
specified by Seller in writing. All payments made or to be made hereunder to
Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller.

Midstream Purchase Agreement; or

 



 

(g) by Seller, if the Deposit is not received in accordance with Section 2.4.

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall be entitled to terminate this

agreements or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed

 **Section 10.3** **_Remedies Upon Default or Termination_** **.**

if Purchasers breach or failure to perform its representations, warranties,

other breaches and failures to perform that have not been waived in writing,

hereunder (subject to the following proviso), Seller shall retain the Deposit

the Deposit as liquidated damages, Seller may then pursue whatever legal or
equitable rights and remedies may be available to Seller, limited to an amount
not exceeding the amount of the Deposit plus reasonable attorneys fees. It is
expressly stipulated by the Parties that the actual amount of damages
resulting from such a termination would be difficult if not impossible to
determine accurately because of the unique nature of this Agreement, the
unique nature of the Assets, the uncertainties of applicable commodity markets
and differences of opinion with respect to such matters, and that the
liquidated damages provided for herein are a reasonable estimate by the
Parties of such damages.

 



 

(b) If Purchaser could terminate this Agreement pursuant to (i) **Section
10.1(b)**, if Sellers breach or failure to perform its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, individually or in the
aggregate, with all other breaches and failures to perform that have not been
waived in writing, are preventing or have prevented the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in **Section 8.2 **or (ii) **Section 10.1(e)**, then
as Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy hereunder, Purchaser, at its option,
may either (x) terminate this Agreement, in which case Seller shall refund to
Purchaser an amount equal to the Deposit, free of any claims by Seller or any
other Person with respect thereto or (y) seek an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reasons set
forth in **Section** **10.3(a) or (b)**, then Seller shall refund to
Purchaser an amount equal to the Deposit, free of any claims by Seller or any
other Person with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to receive interest on the
Deposit, whether the Deposit is applied against the Purchase Price or returned
to Purchaser pursuant to this **Section 10.3**.

the Assets which are not reflected in the adjustments to the Purchase Price
following the final adjustment pursuant to **Section 9.4(b)**

 



      
 

 



 

shall be treated as follows: (a) all Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable to the Assets (and all products and proceeds attributable
thereto) and all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with
respect to the Assets to which Purchaser is entitled under **Section 1.4**
shall be the sole property and entitlement of Purchaser, and, to the extent
received by Seller, Seller shall fully disclose, account for and remit the
same promptly to Purchaser, and (b) all Hydrocarbons produced from or
attributable to the Assets (and all products and proceeds attributable
thereto) and all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with
respect to the Assets to which Seller is entitled under **Section 1.4** shall

 **Section 11.2** **_Expenses_** **.**

 



 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any Property Costs which are
not reflected in the adjustments to the Purchase Price following the final
adjustment pursuant to **Section 9.4(b)** shall be treated as follows: (a)

paid by Purchaser, promptly reimburse Purchaser for, and hold Purchaser
harmless from and against, same; and (b) all Property Costs for which
Purchaser is responsible under **Section 1.4** shall be the sole obligation

costs for which Purchaser is liable without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with a copy of all applicable audit reports and written audit
agreements received by Seller and relating to periods for which Purchaser is
partially responsible.

Without limiting Purchasers rights to indemnity under this **Article 11**,
on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall assume and hereby agrees to fulfill,

environment, or any other environmental condition of the Assets, and (viii)

rights or assume any obligations or liabilities of Seller to the extent that
they are:

 



 

(a) attributable to or arise out of the Excluded Assets;

 



 

(b) Retained Liabilities;

 



 

(c) the continuing responsibility of the Seller under **Section** **11.1**
or **Section 11.2**; or

OR OTHER FAULT OF PURCHASER INDEMNITEES, SELLER INDEMNITEES, INVITEES AND/OR

 **A PRE-EXISTING DEFECT, WHETHER PATENT OR LATENT, OF THE PREMISES OF
PURCHASER S PROPERTY OR SELLERS PROPERTY (INCLUDING THE ASSETS), INVITEES
AND/OR THIRD PARTIES.**

 



 

(b) **_Purchaser Indemnity Obligation_**. If the Closing occurs, subject only
to **Section 11.4(**c) and the limitations contained in **Section 11.7**,
Purchaser shall be responsible for and indemnify, defend, release and hold
harmless Seller Indemnitees from and against all Claims relating to, arising
out of or resulting from:

(ii) the ownership, use or operation of the Assets after the Effective Time,
**REGARDLESS OF FAULT** ;

 



 

(iii) Purchasers breach of any of Purchasers covenants or agreements

FAULT**.

 



 

(d) **_Additional Provisions_**.

 



 

It is the intention of the Parties that this **Article 11** and the special
warranty of title in the Conveyance and Term Royalty Deed shall govern the
allocation of risks and liabilities between Purchaser and Seller.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to the special warranty of title in the Conveyance and Term Royalty
Deed, this **Section** 11.4 contains the Parties exclusive remedy against
each other arising under, related to or with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including breaches of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in **Article**
5 and **Article 6** and **Article 7** and the affirmations of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the
certificate delivered by each Party at Closing pursuant to **Section 9.2(c)
**or **Section 9.3(d)**, as applicable, except for actions for specific
performance or other equitable relief expressly permitted to be sought
pursuant to this Agreement or as set forth in the next paragraph, and no
Person will have any other remedy or recourse, whether in contract or tort or
otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties hereto to the fullest extent
permitted by Law.

 



 

Claims for Property Costs shall be exclusively handled pursuant to the
Purchase Price adjustments in **Section 2.2**, and pursuant to **Section
11.2**, and shall not be subject to indemnification under this **Section
11.4**. Claims for Title Defects (and Title Benefits) and Environmental
Defects shall be exclusively handled pursuant to **Article 3** and **Article
4**, as

 



      
 

 



 

applicable, and shall not be subject to indemnification under this **Section
11.4**. Claims relating to the final calculation of the Purchase Price shall
be exclusively handled pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of
**Section 9.4**.

 



 

In connection with Purchaser Indemnitees access to the Assets prior to
Closing, the Parties acknowledge that such access may be subject to boarding
agreements, releases or other agreements required by the operator of non-
Seller Operated Assets. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
such agreements and **Section 11.4(b)(v) **of this Agreement, **Section
11.4(b)(v) **of this Agreement shall control.

 



 

 **Section 11.5** **_Indemnification Actions_** **.**

 



 

All claims for indemnification under **Section 11.4** shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this **Article 11**, the term "Indemnifying Party" means
the party or parties having an obligation to indemnify another party or
parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The term "Indemnified Party"
means the party or parties having the right to be indemnified by another party
or parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification ("Indemnity Claim") under **Section
11.4**, and/or any other Article (or part thereof) expressly stating that it
controls over the terms of this **Article 11**, an Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of its Indemnity Claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its Indemnity
Claim (the "Claim Notice"). The Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim
for which it seeks indemnification and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this **Section
11.5** shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under
**Section 11.4** except to the extent such failure results in insufficient
time being available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend
against the Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Partys ability to
defend against the Claim. In the event that the Indemnity Claim is based upon
an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement,
the Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement which was inaccurate or breached.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the relevant Claim at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently
defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this **Section 11.5(d)**. An Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not
include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Claim, or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially
and adversely affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money
damages covered by the indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party or admits its liability but fails to diligently prosecute or
settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Claim
at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability for a Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten
(10) Business Days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing
its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the Claim
and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement.

 



 

 **Section 11.6** **_Release_** **.**

 



 

(a) EXCEPT FOR THE REMEDIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, PURCHASER RELEASES,
REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS,
KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR ARISING IN THE FUTURE, CONTINGENT OR
OTHERWISE, IN CONTRACT AND IN TORT, WHICH PURCHASER MIGHT NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY
MAY HAVE AGAINST SELLER INDEMNITEES, RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO THE
ASSETS AND ARISING OUT OF OR INCIDENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, ENVIRONMENTAL
LIABILITIES, THE RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR NORM INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
OR PROTECTION OF HUMAN HEALTH, SAFETY, NATURAL RESOURCES OR THE ENVIRONMENT,
INCLUDING RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL
RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED, REGARDLESS OF
FAULT.

 



 

(b) Purchaser covenants and agrees that it will not attempt to avoid the
effect of the release made by it hereinabove by later arguing that at the time
of the release it did not fully appreciate the extent of any such Claims,
including Claims arising under Environmental Laws.

 



 

 **Section 11.7** **_Limitation on Actions_** **.**

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in **Articles **5 and 6
and the corresponding representations and warranties given in the certificates
delivered at the Closing pursuant to **Section 9.2(c)** and **Section
9.3(c)**, as applicable, shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12)
months, except that (i) the representations and warranties in **Section 5.8**
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and (ii) the representations and warranties in **Section
5.22(b)** shall expire at the Closing. The remainder of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements provided for in this Agreement shall not
survive Closing except that

 



      
 

 



 

covenants and agreements contemplated to be complied with or performed
following the Closing shall survive indefinitely. Representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the
date of their expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any
bona fide Claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the breach
of such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on or before its
expiration date.

 



 

(b) The indemnities in **Sections** **11.4(b)(iii)** , **11.4(b)(iv)** ,
**11.4(c)(ii)** and **11.4(c)(iii)** shall terminate as of the termination
date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that
is subject to indemnification, except in each case as to Claims asserted
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the breach of such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on or before such termination date.
Purchasers indemnities in **Sections** **11.4(b)(i)** , **11.4(b)(ii)** ,
and **11.4(b)(v)** and Sellers indemnity in **Section 11.4(c)(i) **
continue without time limit.

 



 

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under
**Section 11.4(c)(ii)** or **Section 11.4(c)(iii)** until and unless the
amount of an individual Claim exceeds $100,000 and the aggregate amount of the
liability for all Claims exceeding such threshold, in each case, for which
Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser, exceeds one and a half percent
(1.5%) of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent the aggregate
amount of all such Claims exceeds one and a half percent (1.5%) of the
Purchase Price; _provided, however_ , that this **clause (c)** shall not
apply to liability for breaches of the covenant in **Section 7.8**. The
adjustments to the Purchase Price under **Section 2.2** and any payments in
respect thereof shall not be limited by this Section.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under this
**Article 11** for aggregate damages in excess of an amount equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of the Purchase Price; _provided, however_ , that this **clause
(d)** shall not apply to liability for breaches of the covenant in **Section
7.8**.

 



 

(e) The amount of any Claims for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnity under this **Article 11** shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds or Tax benefits, if any, realized by the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates (or direct or indirect owners) with respect to such Claims,
net of any collection costs and excluding the proceeds of any insurance policy
issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.

 



 

(f) Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification or any other remedy
under this Agreement with respect to any Claims to the extent attributable to
or arising out of the actions of Purchaser after Closing as owner and operator
of any of the Properties.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will the
Seller Indemnitees or the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to duplicate
recovery under this **Article 11** with respect to (i) any Claim, even though
the facts or series of related facts giving rise to such Claim may constitute
a breach of more than one representation, warranty or covenant or agreement
set forth herein, in the Conveyances or in any document delivered in
connection with the Closing or (ii) any adjustments to the Purchase Price
pursuant to **Section 2.2**.

 



 

(h) Neither Party shall have any liability as to the other Party, and each
expressly waives any claim for, punitive, exemplary, remote, or speculative
damages or damages that are

 



       
 

 



 

not the natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of a breach of
this Agreement, including damages arising from the special circumstances of
the Purchaser Indemnitee, as applicable, whether or not such special
circumstances were communicated to the Parties at the time this Agreement was
executed; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit such
damages to the extent they are recovered by any unaffiliated third party
against any Party hereto in a third party claim for which such Party would
otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this **Article 11**.

 **Section 11.9** **_Waiver of Trade Practices Acts_** **.**

 



 

(a) It is the intention of the Parties that Purchasers rights and remedies
with respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade
PracticesConsumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. § 17.41 _et
seq. _(the "DTPA"). As such, Purchaser hereby waives the applicability of the
DTPA to this transaction and any and all duties, rights or remedies that might
be imposed by the DTPA, whether such duties, rights and remedies are applied
directly by the DTPA itself or indirectly in connection with other statutes;
_provided_ , _however_ , Purchaser does not waive § 17.555 of the DTPA.
Purchaser acknowledges, represents and warrants that it is purchasing the
goods and/or services covered by this Agreement for commercial or business
use; that it has assets of $5 million or more according to its most recent
financial statement prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles; that it has knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of a transaction such
as this; and that it is not in a significantly disparate bargaining position
with Seller.

 



 

(b) Purchaser expressly recognizes that the price for which Seller has agreed
to perform its obligations under this Agreement has been predicated upon the
inapplicability of the DTPA and this waiver of the DTPA. Purchaser further
recognizes that Seller, in determining to proceed with the entering into of
this Agreement, has expressly relied on this waiver and the inapplicability of
the DTPA.

 



 

 **Section 11.10** **_Recording_** **.**

 



 

As soon as practicable after Closing, Purchaser shall record the Conveyance in
the appropriate counties and/or parishes and provide Seller with copies of all
recorded or approved instruments.

 



 

The Conveyance and Term Royalty Deed are intended to convey all of the
Properties being conveyed pursuant to this Agreement. Certain Properties or
specific portions of the Properties that are leased from, or require the
approval to transfer by, a Governmental Body are

 



      
 

 



 

conveyed under the Conveyance and also are described and covered by other
separate assignments made by Seller to Purchaser on officially approved forms,
or forms acceptable to such entity, in sufficient multiple originals to
satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. **The interests
conveyed by such separate assignments are the same, and not in addition to,
the interests conveyed in the Conveyance attached as Exhibit D. Further, such
assignments shall be deemed to contain the special warranty of title of Seller
and all of the exceptions, reservations, rights, titles, power and privileges
set forth herein and in the Conveyance as fully and only to the extent as
though they were set forth in each such separate assignment.**

 



 

 **ARTICLE 12 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 12.1** **_Counterparts_** **.**

 



 

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute
but one agreement. Either Partys delivery of an executed counterpart
signature page by facsimile (or email) is as effective as executing and
delivering this Agreement in the presence of the other Party. No Party shall
be bound until such time as all of the Parties have executed counterparts of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 12.2** **_Notice_** **.**

Either Party may change its address for notice by notice to the other in the
manner set forth above. All notices shall be deemed to have been duly given at
the time of receipt by the Party to which such notice is addressed.

 



 

 **Section 12.3** **_Sales or Use Tax Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and
Fees_** **.**

 



 

Purchaser shall bear any sales, use, transfer, goods and services,
registration, capital, documentary, stamp, recording or other similar Taxes
("Transfer and Recording Taxes") incurred and imposed upon, or with respect
to, the property transfers or other transactions contemplated hereby,
including any fees or payments to third parties under the Leases or Surface
Contracts (if any) and the transfer fees set forth on **Schedule 12.3**. If
such transfers or transactions are exempt from any Transfer and Recording
Taxes upon the delivery or filing of an appropriate certificate or other
evidence of exemption, Seller will cooperate with Purchaser in obtaining such
certificate or evidence and as otherwise reasonably requested by Purchaser to
minimize the imposition of such Transfer and Recording Taxes.

 



 

 **Section 12.4** **_Expenses_** **.**

 



 

Except as provided in **Section 12.3**, all expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation or execution of
this Agreement, the Conveyance delivered hereunder and the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing,
including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and financial advisers
employed by Seller, shall be borne solely and entirely by Seller, and all such
expenses incurred by Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely by
Purchaser.

 



 

 **Section 12.5** **_Change of Name_** **.**

 



 

As promptly as practicable, but in any case within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall eliminate in all material respects the names
"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation", "Anadarko" and any variants thereof from the
Assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement and, except with respect to such
grace period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any
logos, trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **Section 12.6** **_Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and
Guarantees_** **.**

 



 

The Parties understand that none of the bonds, letters of credit and
guarantees, if any, posted by Seller with Governmental Bodies and relating to
the Assets may be transferable to Purchaser. Promptly following Closing,
Purchaser shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Purchaser,
replacements for such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees, to the extent
such replacements are necessary to permit the cancellation of the bonds,
letters of credit and guarantees posted by Seller or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 12.7** **_Governing Law and Venue_** **.**

OF ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW
OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR
CLAIM BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT OR ANY DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE
MAINTENANCE OF SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A
JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON
THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

 



 

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.

provision of this Agreement.

Any failure by any Party or Parties to comply with any of its or their
obligations, agreements or conditions herein contained may be waived in
writing, but not in any other manner, by the Party or Parties to whom such
compliance is owed. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the

or consent to a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar),
nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise

No Party shall assign all or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any Party

inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 12.11** **_Entire Agreement_** **.**

 



 

The Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules
attached hereto, any Boarding Agreements executed by the Parties in connection
with Purchasers access to the Assets prior to Closing and the documents to be
executed hereunder constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

 **Section 12.12** **_Amendment_** **.**

 



 

This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing
executed by both Parties. No waiver of any right under this Agreement shall be
binding unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound thereby.

 



 

 **Section 12.13** **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_** **.**

 



 

Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle any Person other than Purchaser and
Seller to any Claims, remedy or right of any kind, except as to those rights
expressly provided to Seller Indemnitees and Purchaser Indemnitees and those
rights expressly provided in **Section 12.20** _provided_ , _however_ , that
any claim for indemnity hereunder on behalf of a Seller Indemnitee or a
Purchaser Indemnitee must be made and administered by a Party to this
Agreement. Each of Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise
indemnification rights under **Section 11.5** on behalf of the other
Indemnified Parties affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have
no liability to any such other Indemnified Parties for any action or inaction
under **Section 11.5**.

In this Agreement:

(b) References to the singular includes the plural, and vice versa;

 



 

(c) Reference to any Article or Section means an Article or Section of this
Agreement;

 



 

(d) Reference to any Exhibit or Schedule means an Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement, all of which are incorporated into and made a part of this
Agreement;

 



 

(e) Unless expressly provided to the contrary, "hereunder", "hereof, "herein"
and words of similar import are references to this Agreement as a whole and
not any particular Section or other provision of this Agreement;

 



 

(f) References to any Law will include all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and references to any Law will be construed as including any legal
and statutory provisions consolidating, amending, succeeding or replacing the
applicable Law;

 



 

(g) References to any document will include any amendment, restatement or
supplement to, or replacement or novation of, such document, but disregarding
any amendment, restatement, supplement, replacement or novation made in breach
of this Agreement;

 



      
 

 



 

(h) References to "days" are to calendar days unless otherwise indicated;

 



 

(i) Unless otherwise specified, currency amounts referenced herein are in
United States Dollars; and

 



 

(j) "Include" and "including" means include or including without limiting the
generality of the description preceding such term.

 



 

 **Section 12.15** **_Construction_** **.**

 



 

Purchaser is a Party capable of making such investigation, inspection, review
and evaluation of the Assets as a prudent purchaser would deem appropriate
under the circumstances including with respect to all matters relating to the
Assets, their value, operation and suitability. Each of Seller and Purchaser
has had substantial input into the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from equal bargaining
positions. In the event of a dispute over the meaning or application of this
Agreement, it shall be construed fairly and reasonably and neither more
strongly for nor against either Party.

 



 

 **Section 12.16** **_Conspicuousness_** **.**

 



 

The Parties agree that provisions in this Agreement in "bold" or "all caps"
type satisfy any requirements of the "express negligence rule" and any other
requirements at law or in equity that provisions be conspicuously marked or
highlighted.

 



 

 **Section 12.17** **_Severability_** **.**

 



 

If any term or other provisions of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced under any rule of law, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in a materially adverse manner with
respect to either Party.

 



 

 **Section 12.18** **_Time of Essence_** **.**

 



 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement with respect to all time periods and
notice periods. If the date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice
or taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any
notice is required to be given or any action taken expires on a date which is
not a Business Day), then the date for giving such notice or taking such
action (and the expiration date of such period during which notice is required
to be given or action taken) shall be the next day which is a Business Day.

 



 

 **Section 12.19** **_Equitable Remedies_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are unique and that
remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be inadequate in the event
it should default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event of any breach (i) by Purchaser, prior to the
Closing, of **Section 7.2**, **Section 7.5**, **Section 7.11**, or of the
Confidentiality Agreement or, following the Closing, any agreement or covenant
set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing; or (ii) by
Seller, prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

Closing, of **Section 7.1**, **Section 7.2**, **Section 7.5 **or **Section
7.7 **or of the Confidentiality Agreement or, following the Closing, any
agreement or covenant set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the
Closing, the other Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, without
the proof of actual damages, including in the form of an injunction or
injunctions or temporary orders for specific performance to prevent such
breaches of this Agreement and to order the defaulting Party to affirmatively
carry out such obligations under this Agreement, and each Party hereby waives
any defense to the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for
such breach. Such equitable relief shall be in addition to any other remedy to
which each Party is entitled to at law or in equity as a remedy for such
nonperformance, breach or threatened breach and shall in no way serve to limit
a Partys rights under **Section 10**. Each Party hereby waives any
requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such equitable
remedy. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver or
election of remedies by either Party, each of whom expressly reserves any and
all rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity in the event of
any such breach or default by the other Party under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the right of Seller to equitable relief as described in
**Section 12.19(a)**, Seller may not seek equitable relief to cause the
Closing to be consummated and the Purchase Price to be paid.

 



 

 **Section 12.20** **_Non-Recourse_** **.**

 



 

This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim, action, suit or
other legal Proceeding (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto. No Person who is not a
named party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, equity holder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this
Agreement ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to
impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation or execution, and each Party waives and releases
all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party
Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.
