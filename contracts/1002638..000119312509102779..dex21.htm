and acceptance by the  



 

14  Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in writing
by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate of

the Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Delaware Law and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided,
however_ , that at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "Vignette Corporation."

(b) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section
6.14, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective

2.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving

(b) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving

terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any of the following
securities, the following shall occur:

(a) _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of Common Stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and  



 

15  become 1,000 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Series A Preferred Stock
of the Surviving Corporation. In exchange for, and in consideration
of, Parent issuing and delivering (on behalf of the Merger Sub) at or
promptly following the Effective Time shares of Parent Common Stock for the
Merger and paying the Surviving Corporation $10.00 (or such other amount as is
agreed by the Surviving Corporation and Parent), the Surviving Corporation
will issue to Parent at the Effective Time 1,000 (or such other number as is
agreed to by the Surviving Corporation and Parent) fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Company Capital Stock_.

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Company Shares and
any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished and
automatically converted into the right to receive (1) $8.00 in cash, without
interest thereon (such per share cash amount being referred to herein as the
"Cash Consideration") and (2) 0.1447 of one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (such per share amount being
referred to herein as the "Stock Consideration"). The Merger Consideration
shall be paid thereon upon the surrender of the Certificate representing such
share of Company Common Stock (or the receipt of an agents message in the
case of Book-Entry Shares) in the manner set forth in Section 2.9 (or in the
case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner set forth in Section 2.11).
For all purposes of and under this Agreement, the term "Merger Consideration"
shall mean, with respect to a share of Company Common Stock representing the
right to receive such consideration, the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (A)
the Stock Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Parent
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
like change with respect to Parent Common Stock having a record date on or
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time; provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the Parent
Common Stock if (i) Parent issues additional shares of Parent Common Stock and
receives consideration for such shares, or (ii) Parent issues employee or
director stock grants or similar equity awards or stock exercisable pursuant
to equity awards; and (B) the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into shares of Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time (it being understood and agreed that
the inclusion of this clause (B) shall not be deemed to amend or modify in any
respect the restrictions set forth in Article V). Furthermore,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Cash
Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of (x) the
Stock Consideration _times _ (y) the per share amount of any cash dividend
declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock having a record date
on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.



 

16 (iii) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue
of the Merger or pursuant to this Agreement, and in lieu thereof each holder
of record of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to
a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder
of record) shall be entitled to receive from Parent, upon surrender of such
holders Certificate(s) in the manner set forth in Section 2.9, an amount of
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing prices of
Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq for the five (5) trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, any Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company (collectively, "Cancelled Company Shares"), in each
case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder who shall have neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly exercised such stockholders statutory rights of
appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.7. Any such stockholder shall be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in
accordance with the provisions of 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Company Shares held by a
stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such stockholders statutory right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
and such holder of Dissenting Company Shares shall receive the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner set forth
in Section 2.9. The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company
in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (y) the opportunity to direct and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares.

(vi) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition (including restrictions on transferability)
under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement
or arrangement with the Company that does not by its terms provide that such
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition lapses upon
consummation of the Merger ("Company Restricted Stock"), then notwithstanding
any other  



 

17  provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Restricted
Stock shall have the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
such shares in accordance with Section 2.7(b), and such shares shall be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.7(b), which Stock
Consideration or Cash Consideration shall also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition (including
restrictions on transferability), and the certificates representing any shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in respect thereof may be marked with
appropriate legends reflecting the foregoing. To the extent any shares of
Company Restricted Stock are converted into the right to receive Cash
Consideration, such Cash Consideration shall vest and become payable on
the date that the Company Restricted Stock would have otherwise vested
pursuant to its original vesting schedule as in effect prior to the Effective
Time, and such payment shall be made at the first regularly scheduled payroll
date of Parent (or a Subsidiary of Parent) following the vesting date
applicable to such payment.

2.8 _Company Options_.

(a) At the Effective Time, all Company Options outstanding and unexercised,
whether or not vested or exercisable, immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and no longer outstanding. All Company Options shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
applicable payment, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.8.

(b) Company Options with per share exercise prices less than the value of the
Cash Consideration, shall be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the
right to receive (A) an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Cash
Consideration reduced by the applicable per share exercise price of such
Company Option, and (ii) the number of shares subject to such Company Option
as of the Effective Time; and (B) such number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (i) the Stock Consideration, and (ii) the number of
shares subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time. For the
purposes of this Section 2.8(b), an amount necessary to satisfy the applicable
minimum withholding tax obligation shall first be reduced from the amount of
the cash payment to be received pursuant to subsection (A) of this Section
2.8(b) and then, if necessary, from the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to subsection (B) of this Section 2.8(b). For purposes
of this Section 2.8(b), the value of the Stock Consideration shall be based
on the most recent closing price of the Parent Company Common Stock prior to
the date of the Closing.

(c) Company Options with per share exercise prices less than the value of the
Merger Consideration, but greater than, or equal to, the Cash Consideration,
shall be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive, in
shares of Parent Common Stock, an amount equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the applicable
per share exercise price of such Company Option, and (ii) the number of shares
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time. For the purposes of
this Section 2.8(c), the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued shall
be reduced in an amount necessary to satisfy the applicable minimum
withholding tax obligation. For purposes of this Section 2.8(c), the value of
the Stock Consideration shall be based on the most recent closing price of the
Parent Company Common Stock prior to the date of the Closing.



 

18 (d) The Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Option Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or use its reasonable best
effort to take such other actions as are required to provide for the
cancellation of each Company Stock Option as provided in this Section 2.8.
Parent shall pay the applicable payment required by this Section 2.8 as soon
as practical after the Closing. Parent and the Company shall work together in
good faith to determine the most efficient manner to provide such payments in
order to ensure that all applicable payroll taxes which are required to be
remitted by the Company are properly paid.

(e) With respect to the Company Stock Purchase Plans, the Company shall take
all necessary action to (i) terminate the current Offering Period and

Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.12 _Taking of Necessary Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective

of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the
Company and Merger Sub shall take all such lawful and necessary action.

performance required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration
under, any Material Contract, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 3.3(b)(i), (ii) and (iii) and, in the case of the

respectively, set forth a complete and accurate list of (i) all material
"employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not

incorporated) which would be treated as a single employer with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"),
or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any

(A) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 required to have been filed

"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) a

beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. 

(c) Except as would not cause a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Employee
Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and with all applicable Law and Orders. To
the extent applicable, each International Employee Plan has been approved by
the relevant taxation and other Governmental Authorities so as to enable: (i)
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the participants and beneficiaries
under the relevant International Employee Plan and (ii) in the case of any
International Employee Plan under which resources are set aside in advance of
the benefits being paid (a "Funded International Employee Plan"), the assets
held for the purposes of the Funded International Employee Plans, to enjoy the
most favorable taxation status possible and the Company is not aware of any
ground on which such approval may cease to apply.

(d) To the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and there currently
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to be subject
to any material liability under the terms of any Employee Plan or any
applicable Law or Order, including without limitation ERISA or the Code.
Except as required by Laws, Orders or the terms of any Employee Plans, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has announced any intent (whether or
not binding) to amend or establish any new Employee Plan or to increase
materially any benefits under any Employee Plan.

(e) There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened on behalf of or against any Employee Plan, the assets of
any trust under any Employee Plan, or the plan sponsor, plan administrator or
any fiduciary or any Employee Plan, other than routine claims for benefits
that have been or are being handled through an administrative claims
procedure.



 

35 (f) Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, to the
Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has, with
respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-exempt
"prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 406 of ERISA, which could reasonably be expected to result in the
imposition of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any Employee Plan or for which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has any indemnification obligation.

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Employee Plan provides post-
termination welfare benefits to former employees of the Company or its
ERISA Affiliates, other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or any
similar Laws or Orders.

(h) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS to such
effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact, circumstance or event
has occurred or exists since the date of such determination letter that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the qualified status
of any such Employee Plan.

(i) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) result in any
payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any director, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee or
independent contractor, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation. Section
3.15(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code). No payment or benefit
which will be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will result in
any amount failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code.
There is no Contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate is a party or by which it is bound to compensate any
current or former employee or other disqualified individual for excise taxes
which may be required pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

(j) All Contracts of employment or for services with any employee of the
Company or any of it Subsidiaries who provide services outside the United
States ("Foreign Employees"), or with any director, independent contractor or
consultant of or to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, can be terminated
by no less than six (6) months notice or less given at any time without
giving rise to any material claim for damages, severance pay, or compensation
(other than a statutory redundancy or other payment applicable by virtue of
applicable Law or Order).

409A of the Code, including all employer tax withholding and

entitled to claim indemnification from the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to their respective charters or bylaws or as provided in an
indemnification agreement with any such Person.

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has not incurred any liability
under, and has complied in all respects with, the Worker

adequate for the operation of its business. All such insurance policies are in
full force and effect, no notice of cancellation or  



 

41  material premium increase (retroactive or otherwise) has been received, and

other similar claims against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case alleging that any Company product is materially defective or fails to
meet any product or service warranties, in each case which would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter and other than ordinary course
email from first level implementers, no third party has alleged in writing to
the Company, and to the knowledge of the Company, there are no current
material liabilities for warranty or returns or other material claims with

Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act in the Companys Form 10-K or proxy
statement pertaining to an annual meeting of stockholders.



 

42 3.25 _State Anti-Takeover Statutes_. Assuming that the representations of
Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 4.12 are true and correct, the
Company Board has taken all necessary actions such that the restrictions on
business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other
similar applicable "anti-takeover" Law or provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company will not be applicable to the Merger.
To the Knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation applies to or purports to apply to the Merger. The
Company and Company Board have approved all necessary action to render the
Stockholder Rights Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement and the Merger.
The rights granted pursuant to the Stockholder Rights Agreement shall not
become exercisable by reason of the execution or delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

3.26 _Brokers_. Except for JP Morgan Chase, there is no financial advisor,
investment banker, broker, finder, agent or other Person that has been

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Merger (each, an "Other Required Company Filing" and collectively, the "Other

all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

or inquiry. At all times from and after the Companys receipt thereof, the

be required to approve or effectuate any transaction that (i) may not be
reversed should the Merger not be consummated, (ii) would impose greater

the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall work expeditiously in good faith
to prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on
Form S-4 in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Merger (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the
"Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement shall include (i) a
prospectus for the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger,
and (ii) the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such

Representatives in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement, and shall furnish the other party hereto with all information
concerning it and its Affiliates as the other party hereto may deem reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement, and any amendment or supplement thereto,
and each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other party hereto with

applicable Law or Order, neither Parent nor the Company shall effect any
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration  



 

57  Statement without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided; however_
, that the Company, in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change
made in compliance with Section 6.9(b) hereof, may amend or supplement the
proxy statement for the Company pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect
such change, and in such event, the right of approval set forth in this
Section 6.7(c) shall apply only with respect to such information relating to
the other party or its business, financial condition or results of operations,
and shall be subject to the Companys right to have the deliberations and
conclusions of the Company Board accurately described. A "Qualifying
Amendment" means an amendment or supplement to the proxy statement for the
Company if and solely to the extent that it contains (i) a Company Board
Recommendation Change, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the Company Board
for making such Company Board Recommendation Change, and (iii) additional
information reasonably related to the foregoing. For avoidance of doubt, no
Qualifying Amendment shall remove the approval of this Agreement and the
Merger from the items to be voted upon at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(d) The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement shall comply in all
material respects as to form and substance with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the information supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement shall
not, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or declared
effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
stockholders, or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of
either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule
425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (each, a
"Regulation M-A Filing") shall not, at the time any such Regulation M-A Filing
is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall notify
each other as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or
circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement to,
the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement or any Regulation M-A Filing so
that any such document would not include any misstatement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as
promptly as practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the
stockholders of Parent and/or the Company. Parent and the Company shall each
notify the other as promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of any
written or oral comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the
Registration Statement, the Proxy Statement or  



 

58  any Regulation M-A Filing, and shall promptly supply the other with copies
of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC or
its staff with respect to any of the foregoing filings and provide the other
party with a reasonable opportunity to review and respond to such comments or
requests. Prior to filing the Registration Statement or mailing the Proxy
Statement to stockholders (or filing or mailing any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto), each of Parent and the Company, as the case may be, (i)
shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response, (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably and timely proposed by such other party and
(iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to
receiving such other partys approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) Parent and the Company shall make any necessary filings with respect to
the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. In addition, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under any
applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in connection
with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger.

6.8 _Company Stockholder Meeting_. Unless the Company Board shall
have effected a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to Section
6.9(b), the Companys Board shall recommend that the Company Stockholders vote
to approve this Agreement and the Merger, and the Company shall include such
statement in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall establish a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene, hold, and take a vote of the Company
Stockholders on the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the DGCL (the "Company Voting
Proposal") at a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof on a
date mutually agreeable to the Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_
, nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of insufficient shares of
the Company Common Stock present or represented by a proxy at the Company
Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting
and to enable additional time to solicit proxies from the Company
Stockholders, or (ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, Order or a request from
the SEC or its staff, or (iii) the Company Board or any authorized committee
thereof shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting in order to (A) give Company Stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has
sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to Company
Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or
otherwise (including in connection with any Company Board Recommendation
Change), _provided, however_ , that the Company may not postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholder Meeting for a period of more than five (5) Business
Days pursuant to this clause (iii)(A), or (B) to enable the additional time to
solicit proxies from Company Stockholders in favor of the Company Voting
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to
hold the Company Stockholder Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated
in accordance with Section 8.1.



 

59 6.9 _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall: (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent
in any material respect or in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
prevent, delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger, the
Company Board Recommendation, or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or
publicly disclose a proposal to approve, adopt or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal (each such item a "Company Board Recommendation Change").

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement (including the provisions of Section 6.1), at any time prior
to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board and/or any authorized committee thereof may, after the five (5) Business
Day period below, effect a Company Board Recommendation Change if the Company
Board and/or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to causing
a Company Board Recommendation Change to occur, the Company Board shall have
given Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice that the
Company Board intends to take such action and the opportunity to meet with
the Company Board and the Companys financial advisors and outside legal
counsel at such times as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith the Company Boards
rationale for proposing to effect such a Company Board Recommendation Change
and/or possible modifications of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
such manner that would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect such
Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that any such communication shall
be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board expressly publicly reaffirms its approval and recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger in such communication, (ii) providing a "stop, look
and listen" communication by the Company Board or any authorized committee
thereof to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act, provided that any such communication shall be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms its approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in
such communication, or (iii) making any disclosures to the Company
Stockholders that the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall
have determined to make in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, provided that any such communication shall be deemed to be a Company
Board Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms its approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in
such communication.



 

60 6.10 _Access; Notice and Consultation_.

(a) Subject to any restrictions imposed under applicable Law or Order, at all
times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company
shall afford Parent and its accountants, legal counsel and other
Representatives access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice,
to any assets, properties, contracts, books, records, substantially complete
draft financial statements and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as Parent may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (a) any applicable Law, Order or regulation (including any
Law, Order or regulation relating to security clearances) requires the
Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or
information, (b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a
material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information, or
(c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a
third party the right terminate or accelerate the rights under, such Contract.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.10 shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys
properties shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive
testing.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company
shall give prompt notice to the Parent upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of the Company to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Section 7.2(a) or
Section 7.2(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided, however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to
the parties hereunder; and provided further, that the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.10(b).

(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with  



 

61  or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the
extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably
be expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Section 7.3(a)
or Section 7.3(b) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the
parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this Section 6.10(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
information obtained pursuant to the access granted or notification provided
pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be deemed to (i) amend or otherwise modify
in any respect any representation or warranty of the party hereto providing
such access or notice, (ii) impair or otherwise prejudice in any manner
rights of the party receiving such access or notice to rely upon the
conditions to the obligations of such party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) impair or otherwise limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such access or notice. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
acquired or provided pursuant to this Section 6.10.

6.11 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Nondisclosure Agreement, dated May 1, 2009 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and
that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and Representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by
Section 6.10.

6.12 _Public Disclosure_. Except with regard to a disclosure permitted by and
effected pursuant to Section 6.9(b), none of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall issue any press release or make any public announcement or
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided, however_ ,
that either Parent or the Company may, without the prior consent of the other
party hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement as may be required by Law, Order or the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq or the Toronto Stock Exchange if such party first
notifies and (if practicable) consults with the other regarding the timing and
substance of such public announcement or statement. 

6.13 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to (and from and after the Effective Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) honor in accordance with their terms the existing
employment and severance agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director, officer or other employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.



 

62 (b) From and after the Effective Time, and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law or Order, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries of each Continuing Employee in connection with all employee
benefit plans, programs or policies of Parent or its Affiliates in
which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of
level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition would result in
duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents were not subject to
such preexisting conditions and limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under the comparable Employee Plans as of the time immediately preceding the
Closing, and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
deductibles paid under any Employee Plan that provides medical, dental or
vision benefits in the plan year in effect as of the Closing Date in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket requirements under any
medical, dental or vision plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time to the same extent that such expenses were recognized under the
comparable Employee Plan. The provisions of this Section 6.13(b) are not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, and nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Employee
Plan to reflect the terms of this Section 6.13(b). 

6.14 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all material respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
under any and all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and
officers and any Person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Persons"). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the charters and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the charters and bylaws (or other similar organizational documents)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such
six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise
modified in any manner except as required by applicable Law or Order.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 6.14(a),
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless
each Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses),  



 

63  judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the
extent such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or
indirectly out of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates for such action or omission, or alleged
action or omission, that occurred prior to or at the Effective Time;
_provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 6.14(b), then
the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified
Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto unless
it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification under Law or the DGCL), and (ii) each Indemnified Person shall
be entitled at his or her sole cost and expense to retain his or her own
counsel, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the
defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 6.14(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving Corporation nor any of its
Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or otherwise compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to
any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may
be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes a full release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
directors and officers liability insurance policy for its directors and
officers; provided that the aggregate cost of such policy shall not exceed
that amount set forth in Section 6.14 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Such a
"tail" policy shall provide coverage of not less than the existing coverage to
the Companys directors and officers under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance policy. The Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy
in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations
thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

(d) If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
(or Parent) set forth in this Section 6.14.

(e) The obligations set forth in this Section 6.14 shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any
Indemnified Person (or  



 

64  any other Person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in Section 6.14(c) (and their heirs and representatives))
without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other
Person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in Section 6.14(c) (and their heirs and representatives). Each of
the Indemnified Persons or other Persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.14(c) (and their heirs
and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.14(e), with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other Persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.14(c)
(and their heirs and representatives)) under this Section 6.14 shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such Persons
may have under the charters, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in
equity).

(f) The obligations and liability of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
their respective Subsidiaries under this Section 6.14 shall be joint
and several.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.14 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

6.15 _Resignation of Directors of Company Subsidiaries_. At or prior to the
Closing, upon the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the resignations of all directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, in each case to be effective as of the Effective Time.

6.16 _Section 16 Resolutions_. The Parent Board, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution prior to the
Effective Time providing that the receipt by Company Insiders of
Parent Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is intended to be exempt
from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated
thereunder. In addition, the Company Board, or a committee thereof consisting
of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution prior to
the Effective Time providing that the disposition by Company Insiders of
Company Common Stock in exchange for cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby are also intended to be
exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, and the term "Company
Insiders" shall mean those directors and officers of the Company who are
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

6.17 _Nasdaq Listing; Toronto Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Closing,
Parent shall (i) file a Notification of Listing of Additional Shares (or such
other form as may be required by Nasdaq) with Nasdaq with respect to the
shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and (ii) seek the
conditional approval to the listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange of the
shares of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.



 

65 6.18 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law, Order and
rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and the Deregistration of
the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10) days after
the Closing Date.

6.19 _Obligations of the Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub and the

breach set forth in any such written notice (A) at any time during such
thirty (30) day period, and (B) at any time after such thirty (30) day period
if the Company shall have cured such breach during such thirty (30) day
period); or 

(f) by Parent, if: (i) there shall have occurred a Company Board
Recommendation Change; (ii) an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
disclosed or otherwise  



 

69  become publicly known and the Company Board shall have failed to reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation (or taken a neutral position or failed
to recommend against such Acquisition Proposal) within ten (10) Business Days
after such Acquisition Proposal was first publicly disclosed or otherwise
became publicly known; (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes
or would constitute an Acquisition Proposal (other than by Parent) is
commenced, the Company shall have failed to issue a public statement
reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation and recommending that the Company
Stockholders not accept such tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10)
Business Days following commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer;
or (iv) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have intentionally
breached the provisions set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.8, or Section 6.9
of this Agreement in any material respect; or

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding
the prior receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval), in the event
that (i) the Company has not breached any of its material covenants under this
Agreement in any material respect, and (ii) Parent and/or Merger Sub shall
have breached any of their respective material covenants in this Agreement and
shall have failed to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days after
Parent and Merger Sub have received written notice of such breach from the
Company (it being understood that the Company shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) in respect of the
breach set forth in any such written notice (A) at any time during such
thirty (30) day period, and (B) at any time after such thirty (30) day period
if Parent and/or Merger Sub shall have cured such breach during such thirty
(30) day period); or

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to receiving the Requisite Company
Stockholder Approval, in the event that: (i) the Company shall have received
a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Company Board shall have given Parent at least
five (5) Business Days written notice (A) of the identity of the Person(s)
making such Superior Proposal and all of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal (and if such Superior Proposal is in written form, a
copy of such Superior Proposal and all related agreements, commitment letters
and other material documents provided or otherwise furnished by the
Person(s) making such Superior Proposal in connection therewith), and (B)
that the Company Board intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.1(h) in response to such Superior Proposal and the opportunity to
meet with the Company Board and its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel at such times as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith such Superior
Proposal, this Agreement and the terms and conditions hereof, and any
modifications of the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent may
propose in response thereto; (iii) after the foregoing five (5) Business Day
period and, if requested by Parent, meetings with Parent and its financial
advisors and legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
standing and its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Superior
Proposal and after good faith consideration of all proposals by Parent, the
failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h) in
response to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to be a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (iv) the Company Board shall
have authorized the Company to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate
the transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal; and (v) concurrently
with the termination of this Agreement, the Company pays Parent the Company
Termination Fee contemplated by Section 8.3(b)(iii) and enters into the
definitive agreement to consummate the transaction contemplated by such
Superior Proposal.



 

70 The party hereto terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall
deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other party(ies) hereto setting

this Agreement is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the
basis for such termination under such provision.

8.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 shall be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to
the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
be of no further force or effect without liability of any party or parties
hereto, as applicable (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party or parties) to the other party
or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of Section 6.12,
this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and ARTICLE IX, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (b) that nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve any party or parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any
breach of, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a)  _Generally_. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated.

(b) _Company Payments_.

(i) In the event that (A) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(c) or 8.1(d), a Competing Acquisition Transaction shall have been publicly
announced, (B) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c)
or Section 8.1(d), (C) at the time of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d), neither Parent nor Merger Sub
has breached any of its material obligations under or in connection with this
Agreement in any material respect, and (D) within 365 calendar days following
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or Section
8.1(d), either any Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the
Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for any
Competing Acquisition Transaction (which is subsequently consummated, whether
or not within the preceding 365 calendar day period), then the Company shall
pay to Parent an amount in cash equal to $10,850,000 (the "Company Termination
Fee"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after
the consummation of a Competing Acquisition Transaction. Any amount previously
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b)(iv) or Section 8.3(b)(v) shall
be deducted from the Termination Fee otherwise payable pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b)(i).



 

71 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(f), the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after the
Company receives a written demand for payment from Parent.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1(h), the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, as a condition to the effectiveness of such
termination.

(iv) In the event this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(c) the Company shall pay to Parent an amount in cash equal to up
to $2,000,000 of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses actually incurred and paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger
Sub of their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
Merger, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after
the Company receives a written demand for payment from Parent; _provided,
however_ , that the cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section
8.3(b)(iv) shall not be payable by the Company in the event that Parent has
breached its material obligations under this Agreement and such breach shall
have been the cause of, or resulted in, either (i) the failure to satisfy the
conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate the
Merger set forth in Article VIII prior to the Termination Date, or (ii) the
failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to the Termination Date.

(v) In the event this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(d) the Company shall pay to Parent an amount in cash equal to up to
$2,000,000 of the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
actually incurred and paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of
their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after the
Company receives a written demand for payment from Parent.

(vi) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.3, and in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fee
set forth in this Section 8.3 or any portion of such fee, the Company shall
pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee
at the prime rate as reported in the Money Section of the Wall Street Journal
(or comparable publication if the Wall Street Journal is not in publication)
on the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment.



 

72 (c) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, whether nor not the Company Termination Fee may
be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

(d) _Liquidated Damages_. In the event that Parent shall receive the Company
Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company or any of
its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination;
_provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall release any party from
liability for fraud.

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law or Order and subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ ,
that in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders without
such approval.

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to the
Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent
legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
or parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable; and such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance
with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any
delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute
a waiver of such right.

74 9.3 _Assignment_. No party may assign (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties hereto and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any purported assignment
hereof not in compliance with this Section 9.3 shall be null and void.

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements, documents,
instruments and certificates among the parties hereto as contemplated by
or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided, however_ , the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded, shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect.
EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON THE ONE HAND,
NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES TO
THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
OTHER INFORMATION, MADE (OR MADE AVAILABLE BY) BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS
REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT TO
THE CONTRARY, NO PARTY SHALL BE RELIEVED FROM ACTIONS OF FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL
MISREPRESENTATION.

9.5 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except
(a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section
6.14, (b) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock to pursue claims for damages (including
damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transaction to Company
Stockholders) and other relief (including equitable relief) for any material
breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, whether or not this
Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to Article VIII, which right
is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, and (c)
from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the
Company Common Stock to receive the merger consideration set forth in Article
II. The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 9.5 shall only
be enforceable on behalf of Company Stockholders by the Company in its sole
and absolute discretion, as agent for the Company Stockholders, it being
understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach
to such shares of the Company Common Stock and subsequently transfer therewith
and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or
received by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred
by the Company in connection therewith) may, in the Companys sole and
absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole or in part, by the
Company to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock of record as of any
date determined by the Company or (B) retained by the Company for the use and
benefit of the Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company
deems fit. 



 

75 9.6 _Severability_. In the event that any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be
illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, and the application of such provision to
other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.7 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts to
be made and performed entirely therein, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof.

9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy
for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as applicable), and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this Agreement, and this right
shall include the right of any party to cause the other party to cause the
Merger to be consummated. The parties hereby agree not to raise any objections
to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any party
hereto, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement. The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 9.9, a party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under
this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
Section 9.9 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing
set forth in this Section 9.9 shall require any party hereto to institute any
proceeding for (or limit any partys  



 

76  right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this
Section 9.9 prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under Article VIII (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall
the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.9 or
anything set forth in this Section 9.9 restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article VIII or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
accordance with this Section 9.10 or in such other manner as may be permitted
by applicable Law or Order, and nothing in this Section 9.10 shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law or Order, including the ability to serve legal process on the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (b) irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets
in any action or proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the
Delaware Chancery Court in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, (c) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (d) agrees that any actions or
proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in the
Delaware Chancery Court, (e) waives any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
agrees not to plead or claim the same and (f) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law or Order.

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties
need not sign the same counterpart.

9.13  _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
parties intention that no term  



 

77  contained in or omitted from any prior written draft of this Agreement be
used as extrinsic evidence under any state law or judicial interpretation
to determine the intent of the parties hereto.

7.6 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision
in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties hereto agree that the court
making such determination shall have the power to limit such term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the Parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

7.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Proxy between a Stockholder and
Open Text collectively set forth the entire understanding of Open Text and
each Stockholder relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between Open
Text and such Stockholder relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

7.8 Assignment; Binding Effect. Except as provided herein (including in
accordance with the transfer provisions set forth in  _Section 2_ hereof),
neither this Agreement nor any of the interests or obligations hereunder may
be assigned or delegated by any Stockholder, and any attempted or purported
assignment or delegation of any of such interests or obligations shall be
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon
each Stockholder and his or her heirs, estate, executors and personal
representatives and his, her or its successors and assigns, and shall inure to
the benefit of Open Text and its successors and assigns. Without limiting any
of the restrictions set forth in _Section 2_ or elsewhere in this Agreement,
this Agreement shall be binding upon any Person to whom any Subject Securities
Owned by such Stockholder are transferred. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to confer on any Person (other than Open Text and its successors and
assigns) any rights or remedies of any nature.

7.9 Fiduciary Duties. Each Party hereto acknowledges and agrees that no
Stockholder is making any agreement or understanding herein in any capacity
other than in her, his or its capacity as a stockholder of Vignette. If any
Stockholder is or becomes an officer or member of the Board of Directors of
Vignette, nothing herein shall in any way limit or affect actions taken by him
or her in such capacity, and no action taken in his or her capacity as such
as  



 

7  officer or director in furtherance of his or her fiduciary duties as an
officer or director of Vignette shall be deemed to be a breach of the
provisions of this Agreement.

7.10 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement or the Proxy
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Each Stockholder agrees that, in the event of any breach by any
Stockholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or in
the Proxy, Open Text shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that
may be available to it, including monetary damages) to seek (a) a decree or
order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach.
Each Stockholder further agrees that neither Open Text nor any other Person
shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 7.10_, and each Stockholder irrevocably waives
any right he, she or it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

7.11 Non-Exclusivity. The rights and remedies of Open Text under this
Agreement are not exclusive of or limited by any other rights or remedies
which it may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of
which shall be cumulative (and not alternative). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the rights and remedies of Open Text under this
Agreement, and the obligations and liabilities of each Stockholder under this
Agreement, are in addition to their respective rights, remedies, obligations
and liabilities under common law requirements and under all
applicable statutes, rules and regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall
limit any Stockholders obligations, or the rights or remedies of Open Text,
under any other agreement between Open Text and such Stockholder; and nothing
in any such other agreement shall limit any Stockholders obligations, or any
of the rights or remedies of Open Text, under this Agreement.

7.12 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws. In any action or suit between any of the parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the actions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement: (a) each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal
courts located in the State of Delaware; and (b) if any such action or suit is
commenced in a state court, then, subject to applicable Law, no Party shall
object to the removal of such action or suit to any federal court located in
the District of Delaware.

7.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN  



 

8  INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 7.13_.

7.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all
such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

7.15 Attorneys Fees. If any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this
Agreement or the rights of any of the parties under this Agreement, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its
attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such
action or suit.

7.16 Waiver.

(a) No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy.

(b) No Party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied
in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement
and Exhibits to this Agreement.



 

9 (e) The bold-faced headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of

not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement.

hereunder shall be individual and not joint or several and no Stockholder
shall be liable for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any

FORM OF IRREVOCABLE PROXY

The undersigned Stockholder (the _"Stockholder"_ ) of Vignette Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ( _"Vignette"_ ), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) appoints and constitutes Open Text Corporation, a
Canadian corporation ( _"Open Text"_ ), Paul McFeeters and John Trent, and
each of them, the attorneys and proxies of the Stockholder with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the Stockholders
rights with respect to (i) the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Vignette owned of record by the Stockholder as of the date of this proxy,
which shares are specified on the final page of this proxy, and (ii) any and
all other shares of capital stock of Vignette which the Stockholder may
acquire on or after the date hereof. (The shares of the capital stock of
Vignette referred to in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" of the immediately preceding
sentence are collectively referred to as the  _"Shares"_.) Upon the execution
hereof, all prior proxies given by the Stockholder with respect to any of the
Shares are hereby revoked, and the Stockholder agrees that no subsequent
proxies will be given with respect to any of the Shares until after the
Voting Covenant Expiration Date (as defined in the Voting Agreement).

This proxy is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest and is granted in
connection with the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the
_"Voting Agreement"_ ), among Open Text, Merger Corp., a Delaware Corporation
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Open Text ( _"Merger Sub"_ ), the Stockholder
and the other stockholders of Vignette appearing as signatories thereto, and
is granted in consideration of Open Text entering into the Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof, among Merger Sub and Open Text (the
_"Merger Agreement"_ ). This proxy will terminate, and be of no further force
and effect, automatically on the Voting Covenant Expiration Date (as defined
in the Voting Agreement). 

The attorneys and proxies named above will be empowered, and may exercise this
proxy, to vote the Shares at any time between the date hereof and the Voting
Covenant Expiration Date, at any meeting of the stockholders of Vignette,
including the Company Stockholder Meeting, however called, or at any
adjournment thereof or under any other circumstances upon which a vote,
consent or approval (including any action by written consent) by stockholders
of Vignette is sought, as applicable:

(a) in favor of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and such other matters
contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

(b) against any action or agreement (other than the Merger Agreement and the
actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) that would result in a breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Vignette under the
Merger Agreement; and

(c) against the following actions (other than the Merger and the actions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement): (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction; and (ii) any other action (including amendment to
Vignettes certificate of incorporation or bylaws) which is intended, or could
reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this
Agreement.

The Stockholder may vote the Shares on all other matters not referred to in
this proxy, and the attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this
proxy with respect to such other matters.

This proxy shall be binding upon the heirs, estate, executors, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the Stockholder (including any
transferee of any of the Shares).

Any term or provision of this proxy that is invalid or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity
or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation
or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the Stockholder agrees that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
proxy shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event such court
does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence,
the Stockholder agrees to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to
the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid
or unenforceable term or provision.
