Sellers representatives with full access to the books, records, facilities

and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all relevant books,
records and employees of Seller and Sellers Affiliates to the extent
reasonably required to complete their review of the Closing Date Working

Purchasers receipt of the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule and Closing
Date Inventory Schedule and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and
Closing Inventory, which notice specifies in reasonable detail the amount,
nature and basis of all disputed items, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or
Closing Inventory. If Purchaser so notifies Seller of its objection to
the calculation of Closing Working Capital and/or Closing Inventory, Seller
and Purchaser shall, within sixty (60) calendar days following such notice
(the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and
any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be set forth in
writing and shall be final, binding and conclusive. If, at the conclusion of
the Resolution Period, the aggregate net effect of all amounts remaining in
dispute would result in an aggregate adjustment to Closing Working Capital
and Closing Inventory under Section 3.3 of less than $250,000, then no
adjustment shall be made to the calculation of Closing Working Capital or
Closing Inventory delivered by Seller to Purchaser. 

(d) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the aggregate net effect
of all amounts remaining in dispute would result in an aggregate adjustment
to Closing Working Capital and Closing Inventory in excess of $250,000, then
all amounts remaining in dispute shall be submitted to Ernst and Young LLP, or
such other nationally recognized accounting firm that is  



 

12  not then the independent auditor for either party and is selected by mutual
agreement of Seller and Purchaser (the " _Neutral Auditors_ "), within ten
(10) calendar days after the expiration of the Resolution Period. Each party
agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable
engagement letter, including customary indemnities. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be
shared equally between Seller and Purchaser. The Neutral Auditors shall act as
an arbitrator to determine, based solely on the provisions of this Section
3.3 and the presentations by Seller and Purchaser (such presentations to
contain the information deemed relevant by Seller or Purchaser, each in their
sole discretion), and not by independent review, only those issues still in
dispute and only as to whether such amounts were arrived at in conformity
with the same accounting principles, procedures, policies and methods that
were employed in preparing the Reference Working Capital as set forth on
_Schedule 3.3(a)_ or Sellers inventory policies as set forth on _Schedule
3.2_ , as applicable, and this Section 3.3. The Neutral Auditors
determination shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days of their
selection, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Seller and
Purchaser and shall be final, binding and conclusive. The term " _Final
Closing Working Capital_ " and " _Final Closing Inventory_ " shall mean the
definitive Closing Working Capital and Closing Inventory, in each case, as
agreed to (or deemed to be agreed to) by Purchaser and Seller in accordance
with the terms of Section 3.3(c) or resulting from the determinations made by
the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this Section 3.3(d) (in addition to
those items theretofore agreed to by Seller and Purchaser).

(e) Provided that the sum of (i) the difference between (W) Final Closing
Working Capital and (X) Reference Working Capital (the " _Working Capital
Difference_ "), _plus_ (ii) the difference between (Y) Final Closing
Inventory and (Z) the Inventory Purchase Price (the " _Inventory Difference_
"), is $250,000 or more, then the Share Purchase Price shall be (iii)
increased dollar for dollar to the extent that the Working Capital Difference
is a positive number and (iv) decreased dollar for dollar to the extent that
the Working Capital Difference is a negative number, and the Inventory
Purchase Price shall be (v) increased dollar for dollar to the extent that the
Inventory Difference is a positive number, and (vi) decreased dollar for
dollar to the extent the Inventory Difference is a negative number. Any
adjustments to the Share Purchase Price or Inventory Purchase Price made
pursuant to this Section 3.3(e) shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, within five Business Days after the Final Closing Working Capital
and Final Closing Inventory is agreed to by Purchaser and Seller or any
remaining disputed items are ultimately determined by the Neutral Auditors.

are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which it was incorporated and has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on,
in all material respects, the Business. Seller and Eastman EPC are each duly
qualified, authorized or licensed to conduct business under the laws of each
jurisdiction in which the conduct of the Business or the ownership or lease of
the assets owned or leased by it in respect of the Business requires such
qualification, authorization or license, except where the failure to be so

Material Adverse Effect on the Business.

Section 5.2. _Authorization of Agreement_. Each of Seller and Eastman EPC has
all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
each other agreement, document, instrument or certificate contemplated hereby
to be executed and delivered by it in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (all such other agreements,
documents, instruments and certificates required to be executed by Seller or
Eastman EPC being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the " _Seller
Documents_ ") and to perform its obligations contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and  



 

15  performance by Seller of this Agreement and each Seller Document to which it
is a party, and the execution, delivery and performance by Eastman EPC of
each of the Seller Documents to which it is a party, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller and Eastman
EPC. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and
(assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Purchaser)

against Seller in accordance with its terms, except that (i) the
enforceability hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally,
and (ii) the availability of equitable remedies may be limited by equitable
principles of general applicability. Each of the Seller Documents will be, on
or prior to the Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by, as applicable,
Seller and/or Eastman EPC and (assuming the due authorization, execution and

with their respective terms, except that (A) the enforceability thereof may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, and (B) the

Seller or Eastman EPC with any of the provisions of any of the Seller
Documents, will (a) result in the breach of any provision of Sellers
Organizational Documents or the Organizational Documents of Eastman EPC; (b)
violate, result in the breach or termination of, or constitute (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) a default or give rise to any right
of consent, cancellation, termination or acceleration or right to increase the

Contract, other than those Material Business Contracts identified on _Schedule
5.3_ hereto; (c) to the Knowledge of Seller, constitute a violation of any Law

or imposition of any Lien (other than any Lien in favor of Purchaser and
Permitted Exceptions) upon any of the assets of Eastman EPC, except in the
case of subsections (c) and (d) as is not reasonably likely to have a

approval, Permit or authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or
notification to, any Person or Governmental Body is required on the part of
Seller or Eastman EPC in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Seller Documents, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or the compliance by Seller and Eastman
EPC with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, except (y) for such
consents, waivers, approvals, Permits or authorizations of, or declarations or
filings with, or notifications to, any Person or Governmental Body, the
failure to receive or make is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Business, and (z) for compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _HSR Act_ ").

Section 5.4. _Capitalization; Equity Interests_. _Schedule 5.4_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules sets forth the authorized and outstanding capital
stock of Eastman EPC. All of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital
stock of Eastman EPC have been duly authorized  



 

16  and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned of
record by Seller. Seller is the sole record and beneficial holder of the
Purchased Shares. Seller owns the Purchased Shares free and clear of all
Liens and Restrictions and such shares represent all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Eastman EPC. There are no outstanding (a)
securities of Eastman EPC convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or voting securities of Eastman EPC, or (b) options or other
rights in favor of third parties to acquire from Eastman EPC, and no
obligation of Eastman EPC to issue, any capital stock, voting securities, or

the Year End Balance Sheets, the " _Full Year Financial Statements_ ") and (b)
the unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of June 30, 2006 and the
related unaudited statements of income for the quarter ended as of June 30,

statements of Seller which were prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition of Eastman EPC at
each of the dates of the Full Year Financial Statements and the results of
operations for each of the periods covered thereby. The Interim Financial
Statements were derived from the unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements of Seller which were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except
insofar as they do not reflect normal, recurring year-end adjustments and do
not contain footnote disclosures) and fairly present in all material respects
the financial condition of Eastman EPC at the date of the Interim Financial
Statements and the results of operations for the period covered thereby. The
Full Year Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements have been
prepared in a manner customary for divisions reporting into a consolidated
group within Seller and compiled in accordance with the accounting principles,
adjustments and exceptions described in _Schedules 3.2 and 5.5_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules. The Full Year Financial Statements and the
Interim Financial Statements have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP
standards for presentation on a standalone basis, and both include certain
items that are eliminated in consolidation as described therein and exclude
certain items that may customarily be included in consolidations as described

advisors) and any Governmental Body and any other information supplied by
such party and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Body in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,

unless (a) such information is otherwise publicly available other than as a
result of a disclosure by Seller made in breach of this Section 7.4 or (b) the
release thereof is, in the reasonable judgment of Seller, required by any
Law (including any rule of any securities exchange on which Sellers
securities are traded) or Order to which Seller is bound or subject;
_provided_ , _however_ , in the case of this clause (b), that Seller take all
reasonable endeavors to notify Purchaser prior to making any such disclosure
and shall restrict such disclosure to the minimum required by Law (in the

divulged by Seller or any of its Affiliates to any other Person without the
prior written consent of

through no fault of Seller or any of its Affiliates is or becomes generally
known in the relevant industry, (b) is disclosed to Seller or any of its
Affiliates by a third party having a bona fide right to disclose the
information or the disclosure of which is legally required or (c) is

disclosure and use its reasonable efforts to limit the amount of such
information so disclosed to protect its confidentiality to the extent
possible.

Section 7.7. _Preparation of Financial Statements_. In the event that
Purchaser reasonably determines, based upon the advice of its
independent accountants or a request by the SEC, that it requires any
financial statements (audited or otherwise) with respect to the Business in
addition to the financial statements described in Section 5.5 hereof in order
to comply with the requirements of the SEC, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to afford Purchaser and its auditors access to (a) the
books and records of Eastman EPC and Mustang Pipeline Company (to the extent
related to the Business only) and (b) Sellers auditors and personnel to the
extent reasonably required by Purchaser to prepare and/or audit all such

accordance with their terms), Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that:

Section 8.1. _Confidentiality_. As of the Closing Date, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate and cease to be of effect to the extent information
and materials relate to the Business. From and after the Closing, none of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall use or  



 

30  disclose any non-public or proprietary information of Seller and its
Affiliates that do not relate to the Business except as permitted under the

Section 8.1 shall not apply to any Seller Proprietary Information which (a)
through no fault of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates is or becomes
generally known in the relevant industry, (b) is received after the Closing
from a third party free of any limitations on its use or disclosure and not,
to Purchasers knowledge, through violation of any confidentiality agreement
or (c) is independently developed after the Closing without any reference to

disclosure of the Seller Proprietary Information, but Purchaser shall notify
Seller before making any such legally required disclosure and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to limit the amount of Seller Proprietary
Information so disclosed to protect its confidentiality to the extent
possible.

release or otherwise make any public statement concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser shall so advise and cooperate
with Seller and shall not release such information without Sellers consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless (a) such information is otherwise publicly available other
than as a result of a disclosure by Purchaser made in breach of this Section
8.2 or (b) the release thereof is, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser,
required by any Law (including any rule of any securities exchange on which
Purchasers securities are traded) or Order to which Purchaser is bound or
subject; _provided_ , _however_ , in the case of this clause (b), that
Purchaser shall take all reasonable endeavors to notify Seller prior to
making any such disclosure and shall restrict such disclosure to the minimum
required by Law (in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser).

Section 8.3. _Consents and Conditions_.

(a) Purchaser shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with Seller in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable, including, but not limited to: (i) obtaining all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from, and giving any necessary
notifications to, third parties; (ii) making all registrations and filings as
promptly as practicable with, and obtaining all necessary actions or non-
actions, waivers, consents and approvals from, all Governmental Bodies
(including those in connection with the HSR Act as further provided below and
any other applicable Law) and using all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, a
Governmental Body; (iii) responding to any information requests from
Governmental Bodies as soon as reasonably practicable; and (iv) defending any
Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction entered by
any Governmental Body vacated or reversed.

(b) Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
promptly furnishing Seller with copies of notices or other communications
received by Purchaser or by any of its Affiliates from any third party and/or
any Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.
Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly furnish to the other such  



 

31  necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may
request in connection with the foregoing and shall each promptly provide
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings made by such party,
and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) and any
Governmental Body and any other information supplied by such party and such
partys Affiliates to a Governmental Body in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and
Seller may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other as for "outside
counsel only," and materials may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Business and (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements. Materials designated as for "outside counsel only"
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission
is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Seller,
as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each party shall, subject to
applicable Law, permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity
to review in advance, and consider in good faith, the views of the other
party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Body. Purchaser and Seller agree not to participate, or to permit
their affiliates to participate, in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Body in connection
herewith and the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the
other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Body, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be deemed to have breached
this covenant if (x) Purchaser uses efforts reasonable under the
circumstances to contact Seller or its representatives, but is nonetheless
unable to reach any such designated representatives prior to the time at which
such Governmental Body proposes to conduct such meeting or discussion, or (y)
any such designated representatives are unable to participate in such meeting
or discussion at the proposed time.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Purchaser
contained in Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(b), Purchaser shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and not to extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act (except with the prior written consent of Seller,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or enter into any
agreement with the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice not
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall offer to
take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all steps that it is
capable of taking to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted or threatened by any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or by
any private party) so as to enable the Effective Time to occur no later than
the expiration of the time period set forth in Section 14.1(c) (the "
_Termination Date_ "), and shall defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in any court by any party, including appeals. In addition to
and without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall cooperate in all respects
with Seller and use all its best efforts to propose, negotiate, offer to
commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Purchaser or its Affiliates, or
otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is
capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such
action, that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, any of Business as a whole, in order to avoid the filing of any suit
or proceeding or the  



 

32  entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order, which would otherwise
have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond
the Termination Date, or which may be necessary to allow the Effective Time
to occur prior to the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 8.3(c) shall limit
a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE XIV so long
as such party has complied with its obligations under this Section 8.3(c)
immediately prior to any termination.

Section 8.4. _Seller s Access to Documents_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, afford to Sellers representatives, upon reasonable notice
and without undue interruption to Purchasers business, access during normal
business hours to the books and records of the Business pertaining to the
operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date for a period of five (5)
years (or such longer period as may necessary to enable Seller to comply with
provisions of applicable Law) following the Closing Date for the purposes of
(a) allowing Seller to comply with SEC reporting obligations, and (b) other
reasonable business purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Section 8.4 shall affect either partys discovery rights in the event of a
dispute between them. Purchaser agrees to hold all of the books and records
of the Business existing on the Closing Date in accordance with Purchasers
standard record retention policies provided that Purchaser shall not destroy,
alter or dispose of any of such books and records for a period of ten (10)
years from the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law
without first offering in writing at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to
such destruction or disposition to surrender them to Seller.

Section 8.5. _Further Actions_. Purchaser shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied as promptly
as practicable its obligations hereunder and the conditions precedent to
Closing.

Section 8.6. _Use of Seller s Names and Marks_. Purchaser agrees that: (a)
effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall change the name of Eastman
Ethylene Polymers Company, to a name that is not confusingly similar to the
foregoing name, and specifically removing the name "Eastman" from the
entitys name; (b) as of the Closing date, Purchaser agrees that it will not
further use, distribute or display, and/or will cease to further use,
distribute or display, any article or instrument of any kind, including
signs, invoices, labels, letterhead, or business cards, that reflects or
includes any logo, trademark, trade name, trade dress, or those confusingly
similar thereto to the extent depicting or suggesting an Erlenmeyer flask, or
similar designation of Seller that was not specifically assigned to Purchaser
under the Technology Transfer Agreement or the Trademark Assignment Agreement;
(c) Purchaser agrees, within a reasonable time following the Closing date (not

pursuant to Sections 12.2(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), and Sections
12.3(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) exceed the aggregate cap of $25,500,000 as set

operations of the Business or the Eastman EPC Leased Real Property. Without
in any way limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, Seller covenants that
it will continue to timely and fully perform and be financially responsible
for the investigation and remediation of the soil and groundwater
contamination that is currently being performed by Seller pursuant to the
requirements of Compliance Plan No. 50043, which is incorporated into Sellers
Hazardous Waste Facility Permit No. 50043 as issued  



 

43  by the TCEQ. Seller also covenants that it will timely and fully perform and
be financially responsible for any expanded or modified investigation
or remediation that may be required by the TCEQ or the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to the extent that such modification or expansion is
designed to address contamination existing at Sellers Longview, Texas
facility as of the Closing Date.

(ii) Where required by Environmental Law or where subject to indemnification
by Purchaser hereunder, Purchaser shall design and conduct the Response to a
Purchasers Release. Purchasers Response shall comply with the applicable
standards of Environmental Law and shall conform with prudent and generally
accepted industry practices to address a potential risk to human health or
the Environment. Purchasers Response may incorporate risk-based corrective
action, where applicable. Prior to the implementation of any material phase of
the Response, Purchaser shall provide Seller with written proposed
plans, workplans, sampling location maps and schedules for Sellers review
and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser shall
design and conduct any Response to a Purchasers Release in a manner that
minimizes, to the maximum extent feasible, any material disruption of or
interference with the operations of the Sellers business.

(iii) Purchaser and Seller shall consult, and otherwise cooperate, with each
other in good faith to assure that any Response conducted by either party is
conducted as required by the provisions of this Section 12.3 and in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Environmental Law.

(e) _Negotiations with Governmental Agencies_. The party performing a Response
hereunder (the " _Responsible Party_ ") shall have the right to negotiate and
reach agreement with Environmental Authorities as to the nature, timing and
scope of that Response provided that: (i) the Responsible Party shall share
with the other party in a timely matter all material correspondence received
from or submitted to an Environmental Authority relating to any Response
hereunder; (ii) the Responsible Party shall afford the other party timely
access to any non-privileged, material final studies, reports, protocols,
drawings, charts, workplans, reports, risk assessments, schedules or other
documentation relating to any Response; (iii) the Responsible Party shall
provide the other party with timely notice of and an opportunity to attend
and participate in any material meetings or in any hearings with Environmental
Authorities (including, without limitation, material telephonic conferences)
relating to any Response; and (iv) the Responsible Party shall consult with,
and consider in good faith any comments of, the other party in preparing all
material strategies and plans concerning a Response as contemplated hereunder.
When planning or performing a Response to a Release, the Responsible
Party shall not reach agreement with an Environmental Authority on a material
element of that Response without the other partys prior consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

(f) _Conduct of Response Actions_. During any Response in or on the Eastman
EPC Leased Property, the Responsible Party shall be solely responsible for
compliance by that Partys employees, contractors and subcontractors with all
laws and professional standards applicable to its work.



 

44 (g) _Investigations and Assessments_.

(i) Without Sellers prior written consent (to be granted at Sellers sole
discretion), Purchaser shall not conduct or arrange to have conducted a
Voluntary or Discretionary Assessment of the Eastman EPC Leased Property or
any property on or adjacent to Sellers Longview, Texas facility. If Purchaser
receives an Order from an Environmental Authority to conduct any type of
assessment of the Environment at or around the Eastman EPC Leased Property or
if Purchaser reasonably determines that it is required by Environmental Law to
conduct such assessment, Purchaser shall notify Seller of the Order or of its
determination within 48 hours after receiving the Order or making such a
determination. Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with Seller to minimize
the scope of the assessment required by the Environmental Authority or
Environmental Law.

(ii) In the event that Purchaser conducts a Voluntary or Discretionary
Assessment of the Eastman EPC Leased Property or any property on or adjacent
to Sellers Longview, Texas facility without Sellers prior written consent,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek indemnification under Section
12.3(a)(iv) for Losses incurred (a) in the particular area that was
investigated or assessed or (b) in any area subsequently investigated or
remediated as a result of the Voluntary or Discretionary Assessment. Purchaser
shall indemnify Seller for any Losses incurred by it as a result of any
Voluntary or Discretionary Assessment performed in violation of this Section
12.3(g).

(h) _Releases_. Purchaser shall notify Seller immediately, and in no case
more than 24 hours, after becoming aware of any Release of Hazardous
Substances by Purchaser into the Environment, or the discovery by Purchaser of
the presence of Hazardous Substances in the Environment in, on, around or
emanating from the Eastman EPC Leased Property in such quantity, nature or
condition that could reasonably be expected to (i) require a report to an
Environmental Authority, (ii) require a Response under Environmental Law, or
(iii) adversely affect human health (including but not limited to the safety
of workers at the Eastman EPC Leased Real Property) or the Environment. Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser upon becoming aware of any Release that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect human health (including but not
limited to the safety of on-site workers) at the Eastman EPC Leased Property.

(i) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and
Exhibits hereto (including, but not limited to, the Ground Lease, the Other
Agreements and the Services Agreement), the remedies provided under this
Section 12.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties with
respect to Losses arising under, related to or associated with, Environmental
Laws and involving the Business, the Eastman EPC Leased Real Property and
Sellers Longview, Texas facility.

(j) _Cost Sharing for Dallas/ Fort Worth SIP Compliance_.

(i) Purchaser and Seller will work together to develop and agree upon the most
cost-effective compliance strategy for the Business in meeting requirements
associated with the forthcoming proposed amendments to 30 TAC Part 1 Chapter
117 as they relate to the implementation of certain nitrogen oxide emissions
specifications for certain stationary,  



 

45  gas-fired, reciprocating internal combustion engines in the forty-county
area of east Texas (hereinafter referred to as the "Amendments"). Purchaser
and Seller will work together to submit comments on the Amendments during the
comment period in an attempt to mitigate the financial impact of the
Amendments on both the Purchaser and Seller in light of the cost sharing
agreement provided for in paragraph (ii) of this Section 12.3(j). In the
event the Parties jointly retain a third party to assist them in commenting on
the proposed Amendments or contesting any final Amendments, the Parties shall
equally split the costs of retaining such third party.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this Section 12.3(j),
in the event that Purchaser is required to incur capital costs (for example,
costs to replace or modify any of the existing gas-fired engines used in the
Business as of the Closing Date) in order to comply with the Amendments when
and if they become effective, these capital costs, including but not limited
to, the costs of replacing or modifying any engines (and the costs of any
upgrading of any utilities to provide electric service to any of the newly
installed electric engines) shall be allocated fifty percent (50%) to Seller
and fifty percent (50%) to Purchaser.

(iii) Costs subject to the cost sharing agreement under paragraph (ii) of
this Section 12.3(j) will be set forth in one of Purchasers Authorization for
Expenditure ("AFE") forms or comparable form (a copy of which is set forth in
Exhibit M) that has been approved by Seller and Purchaser on or prior to
December 31, 2008. The approval by Seller or Purchaser of an AFE will not be
unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed. The parties acknowledge that it
may be necessary to approve an AFE in advance of December 31, 2008 in order
for a particular project to be installed to comply with deadlines required by
the Amendments, but the parties agree that no AFE shall be issued or approved
before the effective date of the Amendments. The cost sharing agreement
under paragraph (ii) of this Section 12.3(j) will terminate on January 1,
2009 provided, however, that any funds set forth in an AFE that was approved
prior to or on December 31, 2008 will be subject to the cost sharing agreement
under paragraph (ii) of this Section 12.3(j) until such funds have been
expended. In the event that the Amendments become effective but are
subsequently stayed as a result of a challenge in litigation or in another
applicable administrative proceeding, the term of the cost sharing agreement
shall be tolled during that period of the stay and shall resume on the date
that the stay is terminated and shall continue for the amount of time
remaining in the term of the cost sharing agreement as of the start of the
stay. Costs expended by Westlake during the tolling period to meet deadlines
that are not stayed by any judicial or adminstrative challenge of the
Amendments will be eligible for retroactive approval as part of an AFE.
Once the cost sharing agreement under paragraph (ii) of this Section 12.3(j)
is terminated, the responsibility for compliance by the Business with the
Amendments shall be borne solely by Purchaser.

(iv) During the term of the cost sharing agreement under paragraph (ii) of
this Section 12.3(j), the Parties shall attempt to resolve through informal
negotiations any disputes between them involving the Dallas/Fort Worth Ozone
Plan, including but not limited to what constitutes the most cost-effective
strategy for complying with the Amendments, whether a particular cost should
be included in an AFE, and whether a Party has unreasonably withheld or
delayed its approval of an AFE . In the event the Parties cannot resolve such
a dispute by informal negotiation, the dispute shall be governed by Article 7
of the Operating Agreement.



 

46 (v) This Section 12.3(j) and the cost sharing agreement provided herein shall
terminate automatically and be deemed null and void in the event that
Purchaser contracts to sell or sells or otherwise transfers the Business or
assigns the Ground Lease between the parties to an unaffiliated third party,
in which case, upon contracting to sell or otherwise transferring the
Business or assigning the Ground Lease, the Purchaser shall immediately bear
the full cost of complying with the Amendments and the Dallas/Fort Worth Ozone
Plan as they affect the Business, and upon closing on such sale, transfer or
assignment, the unaffiliated third party shall bear all such costs.

Section 12.4. _Procedures for Indemnification_. Whenever a claim shall arise
for indemnification under Section 12.2 or Section 12.3, with the exception of
claims under Section 12.3(a) and 12.3(b), which are governed by the terms of
that Section, and with the exception of claims for litigation expenses in
respect of litigation as to which a notice of claim, as provided in this
Section 12.4, has previously been given, which expenses shall be funded on an
ongoing basis, the Person entitled to indemnification (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party from which indemnification is sought
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of such claim and, when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim. In the event of any claim for
indemnification hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or
Proceeding by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall give such notice
thereof to the Indemnifying Party not later than ten (10) Business Days prior
to the time any response to the asserted claim is required, if possible, and
in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days following receipt of notice
thereof (provided that failure to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to the Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced by such failure). Following receipt of notice of a claim
or Proceeding by a third party, and unless counsel to the Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably determined in good faith that the assumption of such
defense by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to a conflict of
interest, the Indemnifying Party shall have the option, at its cost and
expense, to assume the defense of such matter and to retain counsel (not
reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party) to defend any such claim or
Proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses (except as expressly
provided to the contrary herein) with respect to the defense of such claim or
litigation, other than reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has
not assumed the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall have the option
of joining the defense of such claim or Proceeding (which shall be at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party) with counsel not reasonably
objected to by the Indemnifying Party and counsel for each party shall, to the
extent consistent with such counsels professional responsibilities, cooperate
with the other party and any counsel designated by that party. In effecting
the settlement or compromise of, or consenting to the entry of any judgment
with respect to, any such claim or Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party, or the
Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall act in good faith, shall consult
with the other party and shall enter into only such settlement or compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment as the other party shall consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. An
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement, compromise or
judgment not made in accordance with the preceding sentence.



 

47 ARTICLE XIII

NONCOMPETITION; NONSOLICITATION

Section 13.1. _Noncompetition_.

(a) Subject to Sections 13.1(a)(i) through (vi), Seller covenants and agrees
that for a period of 5 years following the Closing Date (the " _Covenant
Term_ ") it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to enter into or
acquire any new, separate or different business engaged in the manufacture,
sale or distribution of Polyethylene (PE) Products,  _Epolene TM_ Products,
and Ethylene-Acrylate Derivative Products, all of which are defined in
_Exhibit C_ (collectively, the _"Competitive Business"_ ). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in _Exhibit C_ :

(i) in the event that during the Covenant Term, Seller completes a business
combination transaction with a Person that is engaged in any
Competitive Business, which transaction results in the holders of the voting
securities of Seller outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction owning less than 50% of the voting power of the voting securities
of Seller or the surviving entity in the transaction or any parent thereof
outstanding immediately after the consummation of such transaction, the
provisions of _Exhibit C_ shall terminate and cease to be of any further force
or effect;

(ii) Seller may directly or indirectly hold interests in or securities of any
Person to the extent that such investment does not directly or
indirectly confer on Seller more than 10% of the voting power of such Person;

(iii) Seller may maintain and continue the operations of Seller and
its Affiliates that are not being transferred to Purchaser hereunder; and it
is expressly understood that Seller may continue to make, have made, use,
sell, offer for sale and import any product not being transferred to Purchaser
hereunder for any purpose, use or application (e.g., including the _Eastoflex
TM_ brand of amorphous polyolefins, the _Eastotac TM_ brand of hydrocarbon
resins, the maleated polypropylene products formerly sold by Eastman under the
_Epolene TM_ G series, as well as other polymer products and product lines
made in Eastmans facilities other than those located in Longview, Texas); 

(iv) Seller may complete a business combination transaction with a Person that
is engaged in any Competitive Business if the purpose of such combination is
not to avoid the restrictions set forth in _Exhibit C_ , in which case such
acquired business shall not be subject to _Exhibit C_ and may engage in any
activity otherwise prohibited or restricted by Section _Exhibit C_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such acquired business derived in excess of
10% of its net income for the last completed fiscal year prior to such
business combination from activities that constitute Competitive Businesses,
Seller shall use reasonable efforts to divest that portion of such Person that
engages in activities constituting Competitive Businesses on commercially
reasonable terms as soon as reasonably practicable following the
acquisition; 

(v) Seller may produce, acquire or use any product for internal uses or to
conduct Sellers or its Affiliates other businesses that consume, use,
contain, depend upon or otherwise incorporate any such product; and



 

48 (vi) Seller may perform any act or conduct any business contemplated by the
Transition Services Agreement.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that nothing herein shall be
deemed to require Seller to give notice to or obtain the consent of Purchaser
in order to engage in any transaction of the types described in this Article
XIII or otherwise.

Section 13.2. _Nonsolicitation of Transferred Business Employees_. Seller
covenants and agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing
Date it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, solicit, directly
or indirectly, any Transferred Business Employee (at a time when such person
is an employee of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) to terminate his or her
employment relationship with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; _provided_
,  _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries from (a) generalized solicitations of potential employees by use
of advertisements in the media that are not targeted at Transferred Business
Employees, (b) incidental solicitations by search firms that have not been
encouraged or requested to solicit Transferred Business Employees, (c) hiring
individuals not solicited in contravention of this Section 13.2 or (d) re-
hiring Transferred Business Employees whose employment has been terminated by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Transferred Business
Employees listed on  _Schedule 13.2_ the applicable period shall be five (5)
years instead of two (2) years.

Section 13.3.  _Nonsolicitation of Seller s Employees_. Purchaser covenants
and agrees that for a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date it
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, solicit, directly or
indirectly, any employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (at a time when
such person is an employee of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries) to terminate
his or her employment relationship with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries from (a) generalized solicitations of potential employees
by use of advertisements in the media that are not targeted at the employees
of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) incidental solicitations by search
firms that have not been encouraged or requested to solicit employees of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) hiring individuals not solicited in
contravention of this Section 13.3 or (d) solicitations of such employees
contemplated under the Operating Agreement.

ARTICLE XIV

TERMINATION

Section 14.1.  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned any time prior to the Closing:

(a) upon the written agreement of Purchaser and Seller;

(b) by Purchaser or Seller if the other party shall have breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein that would
result in the failure of the closing conditions set forth in Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2, or Section 10.1 or Section 10.2, respectively, and such breach
cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after the
giving of a written notice by the terminating party to the other party of such
breach; and



 

49 (c) by Purchaser or by Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to
November 30, 2006 (subject to any extension of such date to accommodate the
cure period under Section 14.1(b)); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 14.1(c) shall not be available to
any party hereto whose failure to perform any covenant or obligation
hereunder has caused or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before such date; _provided_ , _further,_ that in the event that all of the
conditions of Articles IX and X have been satisfied or are capable of being
satisfied, other than Sections 9.3 and 10.4, then neither party may terminate
this Agreement under this Section 14.1(c) before January 31, 2007.

Section 14.2. _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of
termination by either party under Section 14.1(b) or Section 14.1(c), written
notice thereof shall be given to the other party and this Agreement shall
terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without
further action by either party, upon delivery of such notice, except that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in accordance with its terms and
Section 14.2, Section 15.2, Section 15.3, Section 15.4 and Section 15.7 shall
also survive such termination. Upon any termination hereof pursuant to
ARTICLE XIV, no party hereto shall thereafter have any further liability or
obligation hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability for any willful breach of any term
hereof prior to the date of such termination.

ARTICLE XV
