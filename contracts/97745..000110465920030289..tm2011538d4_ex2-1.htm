---|---|---

---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| pay the aggregate Offer Consideration (including any increase

conditions of this Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| pay on the Settlement Date all fees and expenses incurred by
the Buyer or the Offeror in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions including the Offer that are due on the Settlement Date (the
amounts of cash needed for such payments referenced in this clause 2.3.1, the
"Settlement Amounts"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.3.2| The Buyer shall confirm in the Joint Announcement that it will
have satisfied the certain funds requirements of Section 13 of the German
Takeover Act on the date of filing and publication of the Tender Offer
Document and shall procure that the statement of an independent investment
services enterprise pursuant to Section 13 para. 1 sentence 2 of the German
Takeover Act (the "Cash Confirmation"), confirming that the Buyer has the
necessary means at its disposal to fully finance the Offer as well as the
related transaction costs, is available prior to filing of the Offer for
clearance with BaFin. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.3.3| The Buyer has received a fully executed (i) debt commitment
letter dated as of the date hereof, among the Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources party thereto (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes to such
letter in effect as of the date hereof) pursuant to which such Debt Financing
Sources have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend to
the Buyer the amount set forth therein for the purposes of financing the
Transactions (the "Debt Commitment Letter") and (ii) fee letter, which is the
fee letter referenced in the Debt Commitment Letter (the "Fee Letter") (the
documents set forth in the foregoing clause (i) and (ii), the "Financing
Documentation"). The Buyer has delivered to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the executed 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 12 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Financing Documentation (except that, with respect to the Fee Letter, the fee
amounts, pricing caps, flex and other economic terms set forth therein may be
redacted; provided, however, that such redactions do not permit the imposition
of any new conditions (or the expansion of any existing conditions)). As of
the date of this Agreement, the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources to
fund their commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to
any condition precedent other than the conditions expressly set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter and there are no other agreements, side letters or
arrangements relating to the Debt Financing (other than the Financing
Documentation) that would adversely affect the availability of, or the
conditions to, funding the full amount of the Debt Financing.

  



   | 2.3.4| As of the date of this Agreement, (a) the Financing
Documentation is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of the Buyer and, to the knowledge of the Buyer, each
other person party thereto (subject to applicable Bankruptcy and Equity
Exceptions) and (b) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse
of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or
breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of the Buyer
under the terms and conditions of the Financing Documentation. The Buyer has
fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees
in connection with the Financing Documentation that are required to be
paid on or prior to the date hereof and has otherwise satisfied all other
terms and conditions required by the Financing Documentation to be satisfied
prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Financing Documentation
has not been modified, amended or altered and none of the commitments under
the Debt Commitment Letter have been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.3.5| From the date hereof until the earlier of the Completion Date
or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
arrange and obtain the Financing and the proceeds therefrom in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with Buyer's other sources of funds on
the Completion Date, to permit it to pay the Settlement Amounts due on such
date. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.3.6| The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of any
financing is not a condition to the Buyer\'s obligation to complete the Offer
and the Share Transfer and consummate the other Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, if any financing has not been obtained, the Buyer shall

false or misleading in any material respect or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, to promptly inform the

and its counsel reasonably informed as to the discussions and status of such
request for SEC Relief and will provide the Company with a copy of the letter
providing SEC Relief as soon as possible after Buyer\'s receipt thereof. The

the Intervening Event in such a manner that the failure of any of the

of the Netherlands; and

  



   | (b)| no earlier than the end of such four (4) Business Day period, the
Boards shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that, in light of such
Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by the
Buyer, the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would
continue to be inconsistent with the respective fiduciary duties of the
Boards under the Laws of the Netherlands (it being understood and agreed that
any material change to the circumstances giving rise to the Intervening Event
that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new
notice to the Buyer as provided above; provided, that, with respect to each

deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting (and the Company shall cooperate with the
Buyer prior to the Settlement to prepare to take, or to cause to be taken,
all actions, and prepare to do or to cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to procure such delisting and deregistration);
and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| amend the Company's articles of association, if deemed desirable
by the Buyer, by executing the Company Articles. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.1.2| As long as the Company remains listed on either the NYSE or the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, it shall continue to comply with the Dutch
Corporate Governance Code (except for current and future deviations from the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code in accordance with the "explain" requirement
in respect of such deviations). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.2| Statutory Squeeze-Out Proceedings 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If, following the Settlement Date, the Buyer, alone or together with its
Affiliates, holds at least 95% of the Company\'s aggregate issued and
outstanding share capital ( _geplaatst en uitstaand kapitaal_ ), the Buyer
may commence a compulsory acquisition procedure ( _uitkoopprocedure_ ) in
accordance with Section 2:92a or 2:201a of the DCC to buy out the remaining
holders of the Company Shares. The Company shall provide the Buyer with any
reasonable assistance as may be required, including, if needed, joining such

   | 7.3| Post-Closing Restructuring 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3.1| Taking account of the strategic and business rationale of the
Offer, the Company acknowledges that the terms of the Offer are predicated
on, and the importance for the Buyer to achieve, the acquisition of 100% of
the Company Shares or the entirety of the Company\'s assets and operations.
This importance is based, inter alia, on: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the fact that having a single shareholder and operating without a
public listing increases the Group\'s and the Buyer\'s ability to achieve the
goals of the Transactions and implement the actions of its strategy and
reduces the Group\'s costs; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the ability of the Company and the Buyer to terminate the listing
of the Company Shares from the NYSE and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and all
resulting cost savings therefrom; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| the ability to achieve an efficient capital structure (both from
a tax and financing perspective), which would, amongst others, facilitate
intercompany transactions and dividend distributions. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3.2| In light of the above and the fact that the Buyer\'s
willingness to pay the Offer Consideration and pursue the Transactions is
predicated on the acquisition of 100% of the Company Shares or the entirety of
the Company\'s assets and operations and the willingness of the Buyer to have
an Acceptance Threshold of less than 95%, the Company expresses an
interest in and its support for the Merger and Liquidation or Asset Sale and
Liquidation (as applicable) and the Top Up Option as contemplated in clause
7.3.3 and the Post-Closing Measures as contemplated in clause 7.7. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3.3| The Top Up Option shall be exercisable immediately once, in
whole or in part upon and promptly following Settlement, and subject to the
Back-End Resolution having been adopted. The Top Up Option shall terminate on
the second Business Day after the Settlement Date. In the event that the
Offeror Top Up Affiliate wishes to exercise the Top Up Option, it shall so
notify the Company in writing (the "Top Up Option Exercise Notice"), and shall
set forth in such Top Up Option Exercise Notice the number of Company
Ordinary Shares for which the Offeror Top Up Affiliate exercises the Top Up
Option and subscribes for. Upon receipt of the Top Up Option Exercise Notice,
the Company shall immediately, and in any event on the Settlement Date, issue
the relevant number of Company Ordinary Shares to the Offeror Top Up
Affiliate. At the Subsequent EGM, the Offeror Top Up Affiliate shall not vote
on the Company Ordinary Shares it acquired through exercise of the Top Up
Option. At any other general meeting of the Company, the votes on such shares
shall be cast proportional to the votes in favour and against any
proposal cast on the other Company Ordinary Shares, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 37 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

except that the Offeror Top Up Affiliate may decide in its discretion how to
vote on such shares with respect to any proposals to appoint, suspend or
dismiss members of the Boards.

  



   | 7.3.4| The Buyer shall cause the Offeror Top Up Affiliate to pay the
Top Up Amount (i) in cash, (ii) by contribution in kind of a promissory note
issued by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) by any combination of
the foregoing. The Company shall or shall cause Company Newco, as the case
may be, to cooperate with the Offeror Top Up Affiliate and execute or cause
to be executed any documents and take or cause to be taken any other actions
as may be reasonably requested by the Offeror Top Up Affiliate to effect on
the Settlement Date the issuance of the Company Ordinary Shares in connection
with the exercise of the Top Up Option, and record such issuance in the
Company\'s shareholders register on the Settlement Date. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3.5| After and subject to (i) the Merger Resolution having been
adopted and (ii) Settlement having occurred, the Buyer may determine to, or,
if the Top Up Option has been exercised, in whole or in part, must implement
the Merger and Liquidation, in which case: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| The Company shall procure that the Company, Company Newco and
Company Newco Sub shall effect the Merger in accordance with the provisions
set forth in the Merger Proposal immediately after adoption of the Merger
Resolution. The Buyer shall procure that the Offeror Top Up Affiliate shall,
only vote the Company Newco Class A Shares allotted for the Company Ordinary
Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the Top Up Option in favour and
against any proposal on the Company Newco Class A Shares proportional to the
votes in favour and against such proposal cast on the other Company Newco
Class A Shares, except that the Offeror Top Up Affiliate may decide in its
discretion how to vote on such shares with respect to any proposals to
appoint, suspend or dismiss members of the board of Company Newco; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The Buyer shall procure that the Offeror makes to Company Newco
Sub a cash payment (the "Cash Payment") in an amount equal to (x) the Offer
Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of Company Shares (whereby,
for the avoidance of doubt, a Fractional Share counts as one-twenty-seventh
(1/27th)) held beneficially or of record by the Minority Shareholders minus
(z) any cash paid pursuant to clause 7.3.4 (the amount obtained by
multiplying (x) and (y), the "Cash Distribution Amount") in exchange for a
loan note substantially in the form as included in _Schedule 7-A_ (the
"Company Newco Sub Note"), immediately after the Merger becoming effective. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The Company shall: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 38 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (i)| inform the Buyer of the amount of the Cash Distribution Amount no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date of the Subsequent EGM; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| if the Top Up Option was exercised, procure that Company Newco
Sub reorganizes its issued share capital effective immediately prior to the
execution of the Share Transfer Agreement, such that, pursuant to the
consummation of the Share Transfer Agreement, the Offeror and the Offeror Top
Up Affiliate (or their respective nominees nominated in accordance with the
Share Transfer Agreement) shall acquire all issued shares in the capital of
Company Newco Sub in proportion to their respective relative shareholdings in
the Company (determined at the time of the execution of the Share Transfer
Agreement, disregarding any preference shares of the Company held by either
of them) (such proportion, the "Relevant Transfer Proportion" and such
reorganization, the "Company Newco Sub Capital Reorganization"); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| procure that Company Newco enters into a share transfer
agreement with the Buyer, the Offeror and, if the Top Up Option was
exercised, the Offeror Top Up Affiliate, substantially in the form as included
in _Schedule 7-B_  (the "Share Transfer Agreement"), pursuant to which the
issued shares in the capital of Company Newco Sub will be sold and, subject
to and immediately after the Cash Distribution having been made, be
transferred to the Offeror and, if applicable, the Offeror Top Up Affiliate
(or their respective nominees nominated in accordance with the Share Transfer
Agreement in accordance with the Relevant Transfer Proportion); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| procure that Company Newco Sub executes and provides to the
Offeror the Company Newco Sub Note, immediately after the Merger becoming
effective; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| procure that Company Newco Sub makes a cash distribution to
Company Newco (the "Cash Distribution") in an amount equal to (i) the Cash
Distribution Amount plus (ii) the amount of the distribution in connection
with the Preference Shares Cancellation (if applicable), immediately after
the Merger becoming effective and the Cash Payment having been made; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| procure that Company Newco Sub makes an entity classification
election to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal Tax 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 39 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

purposes, immediately after the Cash Distribution having been made (the
"Company Newco Sub Election");

  



   | (vii)| if there are any issued preference shares in the capital of
Company Newco, procure that Company Newco cancels all preference shares in
its capital against payment of a distribution to which the holders of such
preference shares are entitled pursuant to the articles of association of
Company Newco, immediately after the Company Newco Sub Election having been
made (the "Preference Shares Cancellation"); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (viii)| procure that Company Newco transfers the issued shares in the
capital of Company Newco Sub to the Offeror and, if applicable, the Offeror
Top Up Affiliate (or their respective nominees nominated in accordance with
the Share Transfer Agreement) in accordance with the Relevant Transfer
Proportion by means of the execution of a notarial deed of transfer
immediately after (i) the Company Newco Sub Election having been made and
(ii) the Preference Shares Cancellation having occurred (if applicable), and
that Company Newco Sub acknowledges the transfers in such notarial deed of
transfer (the "Share Transfer"); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ix)| adopt prior to the Settlement Date, in its capacity as sole
shareholder of Company Newco, a resolution to, subject to and immediately
following completion of the Share Transfer, (i) dissolve Company Newco in
accordance with Section 2:19 of the DCC (the "Company Newco Dissolution"),
(ii) appoint the Liquidator as the liquidator of Company Newco in accordance
with Section 2:19 of the DCC, (iii) approve reimbursement of the Liquidator\'s
reasonable salary and costs and (iv) appoint an Affiliate of the Buyer as the
custodian of the books and records of Company Newco in accordance with Section
2:24 of the DCC; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (x)| effectuate the Company Newco Liquidation, and make, with respect
to the outstanding shares in the capital of Company Newco not held by the
Offeror or the Offeror Top Up Affiliate (or their respective nominees
nominated in accordance with the Share Transfer Agreement), an advance
liquidation distribution in cash (x) per Company Newco Class A Share in an
amount equal to the Offer Consideration (the "Company Newco Class A
Liquidation Distribution") and (y) per Company Newco Class B Share in an
amount equal to 1/27th of the Offer Consideration (the "Company Newco Class B
Liquidation

Distribution" and, together with the Company Newco Class A Liquidation
Distribution the "Company Newco Liquidation Distributions"), in each case less
any applicable withholding Taxes.

  



   | 7.3.6| After the Subsequent EGM has been held and subject to (i) the
Merger Resolution not having been adopted at the Subsequent EGM and (ii)
Settlement having occurred, the Buyer may determine to, or, if the Top Up
Option has been exercised, in whole or in part, must implement the Asset Sale
and Liquidation, in which case the Company shall: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| enter into an asset sale agreement with the Buyer, the Offeror
and, if the Top Up Option was exercised, the Offeror Top Up Affiliate,
substantially in the form as included in Schedule 7-C (the "Asset Sale
Agreement") and the Parties shall promptly implement the asset sale as
contemplated by the Asset Sale Agreement (the "Asset Sale"), and take (or
cause to be taken) the steps to complete the actions and transactions set
forth in the Asset Sale Agreement. The purchase price to be paid by the
Offeror in the Asset Sale shall be equal to (i) the Offer Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the total number of Company Ordinary Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to completion of the Asset Sale; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| effectuate the Liquidation, and make an advance liquidation
distribution per Company Share in cash on the Company Shares not held by the
Offeror or the Offeror Top Up Affiliate (or their respective nominees
nominated in accordance with the Asset Sale Agreement) in an amount equal to
the Offer Consideration less any applicable withholding Taxes (the
"Advance Liquidation Distribution"). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3.7| The board of directors of the Liquidator shall initially
consist of the Company, and the Buyer and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (i) procure that the board of directors
of the Liquidator shall, prior to the contemplated Merger, consist of one or
more professional liquidator(s) or similar service provider(s)
(natural person(s) or a professional liquidator service provider(s)) and (ii)
reach agreement with such service provider as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.4| Financing

Non-Financial Covenants Period. The Buyer shall in such case procure that the
governance of the Company as described in clause 6 is, in accordance with its

currently vested) as of immediately prior to the Settlement shall, without any
action on the part of the Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or any other
Person, be cancelled and (consistent with the Company Equity Plans) converted
into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Consideration
over the applicable per share exercise price of such Company Option multiplied
by (y) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Settlement.

  



   | 11.2| Unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs that Will Vest at
Settlement 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as otherwise agreed with the applicable award holder, at the
Settlement, each unvested Company RSU and Company PSU that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Settlement and that vests at the Settlement in
accordance with its terms or the terms of any applicable employment agreement
in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall, without any
action on the part of the Buyer, the Company, the holder thereof or any other
Person, be cancelled and (consistent with the Company Equity Plans) converted
into and

  



  

   

 | | 53 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Offer Consideration by (y) the
total number of Company Shares subject to such Company RSU or Company PSU as
of immediately prior to the Settlement (which, in the case of Company PSUs
with respect to which the applicable Performance Determination Date (as
defined in the Company Equity Plans) has occurred, will be the number of
Company PSUs earned based on actual performance through the applicable
Performance Determination Date as determined under the Company Equity Plans,
and which, in the case of Company PSUs with respect to which the applicable
Performance Determination Date has not occurred, will be the number of Company
PSUs that would be earned assuming 100% achievement of applicable performance
targets as set forth in the Company Equity Plans).

  



   | 11.3| Unvested Company RSUs and Company PSUs 
---|---|--- 
  



  

At the Settlement, each Company RSU and Company PSU that is outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Settlement and that does not vest
pursuant to clause 11.2 shall without any action on the part of the Buyer,
the Company, the holder thereof or any other Person, be cancelled and
(consistent with the Company Equity Plans) converted into a time-vesting
restricted stock unit award (an "Adjusted SUA"), with substantially the same
terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting) as were applicable to
such Company RSU or Company PSU immediately prior to the Settlement, with
respect to a number of shares of the Buyer\'s common stock that is equal to
the product (rounded to the nearest whole share) obtained by multiplying (x)
the Exchange Ratio by (y) the total number of Company Shares subject to such
Company RSU or Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Settlement (which,
in the case of Company PSUs with respect to which the applicable Performance
Determination Date has occurred, will be the number of Company PSUs earned
based on actual performance through the applicable performance period as
determined under the Company Equity Plans, and which, in the case of Company
PSUs with respect to which the applicable Performance Determination Date has
not occurred, will be the number of Company PSUs that would be earned
assuming 100% achievement of applicable performance targets as set forth in
the Company Equity Plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any
Adjusted SUA in respect of a converted Company PSU, the applicable vesting
period shall be the duration of the originally scheduled performance period
relating to such Company PSU or any longer period set forth in an applicable
award agreement, subject to any applicable provisions relating to
acceleration of vesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adjusted SUAs (i)
will not be subject to any minimum Commitment Share Ownership Requirements
(as defined in a Company RSU or

  



  

   

 | | 54 / 107

to and in accordance with the terms of their respective employment
agreements.

  



   | 11.5| Timing of Payments

As soon as reasonably practicable after the Settlement (but no later than the

Company Equity Awards that settle pursuant to clauses 11.1 or 11.2 and
employees entitled to a Transaction Payment shall receive the payments
described in clauses 11.1, 11.2 and 11.4 from the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary or Affiliate through its payroll system or payroll provider.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such payment owed to a holder of such a
Company Equity Award or employee entitled to a Transaction Payment cannot be
made through the Company\'s (or its applicable Subsidiary\'s or
Affiliate\'s) payroll system or payroll provider, then the Company (or its
applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate) shall issue a check for such payment to
such holder or employee as soon as reasonably practicable following the

---|---|--- 
  



  

The payments in respect of Company Equity Awards and the Transaction Payments
described in clauses 11.1, 11.2 and 11.4 shall be subject to clause
2.11. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any
Company Equity Award or Transaction Payment that constitutes nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that
payment of the amounts described in clauses 11.2 or 11.4 would otherwise
cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
such payment shall instead be made at the earliest time permitted that shall
not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty. The Parties shall
cooperate in good faith prior to the Settlement Date with the goal of (i)

(ii) determining the appropriate settlement mechanics in respect of any such
Tax withholding obligations.

the compensation committee of the Supervisory Board, as applicable, shall

necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this clause 11\. The
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide
that the Company shall not be required to deliver the Company Shares or other
shares in the share capital of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Equity Awards after the Settlement Date. On or as soon
as reasonably practicable following the Settlement Date (but in any event
within 5 Business Days after), the Buyer shall file one or more appropriate
registration statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8, or any successor or other
appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of common stock of the Buyer
underlying the Adjusted SUAs.

as a " _beschermingsmaatregel_ " under Section 4.2.6 of the Dutch Corporate
Governance Code) that may be invoked or implemented by the Company (or any of
its Affiliates), or that has been granted by the Company (or any of its
Affiliates) to a third party, including the Foundation, that may be invoked or
implemented by such third party (each, an "Anti-Takeover Measure") is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions. Without prejudice to any
remedies available to the Buyer under applicable Law, if any Anti-Takeover
Measure becomes applicable to any of the Transactions or if the Foundation
breaches any of its obligations under its support agreement with the Company
as referred to in clause 3.5, the Company and the Boards (and any applicable
committees thereof) shall grant such approvals and take such actions within
their power and authority as are necessary or appropriate so that any such
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and any such breach shall be remedied as

officers, other than initiated by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
relating in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions ("Transaction
Litigation"); _provided_ , that the Company shall give the Buyer the right to
(i) review and comment in advance on all filings or responses to be made by
the Company in connection with any Transaction Litigation (and any amendments
thereto) and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments proposed
by the Buyer, (ii) fully participate in (at the Buyer\'s sole expense), but
not control, the defense of such Transaction Litigation, (iii) consult on any
settlement with respect to such Transaction Litigation and (iv)
fully participate in any negotiations or mediation with respect to any

The Company shall promptly notify the Buyer of any such Transaction Litigation
brought, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the
Company, members of the Boards or any Subsidiary of the Company and shall keep
the Buyer informed on a current basis with respect to the status thereof.
Nothing in this clause 12.7.2 shall oblige the Company to take any actions or
provide any information if such would harm its client-attorney privilege in

Authorities and any other Person that may be, or become, necessary for the
performance of their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof
(obtaining such approvals, expiration or termination of any waiting period

all information required or requested to be included in any application,
filing, notification, or submission to be made pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Relevant Antitrust Authorities in connection with
obtaining Antitrust Clearance, including with regard to any Remedy Action as
defined in clauses 13.1.5 and 13.1.6 herein, and pursuant to the Antitrust
Laws. Each of the Parties shall consult and cooperate with the other in good
faith, and have the right to review in advance any application, filing,

Authorities or any third party in connection with the Transactions, including
with regard to any Remedy Action as defined in clauses 13.1.5 and 13.1.6
herein, or under all applicable Antitrust Laws (and any amendments thereto),
and shall consider in good faith comments proposed by the Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be; provided, that with respect to any such
documents or materials that contain information (i) that is commercially
sensitive or (ii) the provision of which would infringe Antitrust Laws, such
information may be provided solely to those individuals acting as outside
legal counsel for the other; provided, further, that such counsel shall not
disclose such information to such other Party and shall enter into a joint
defense agreement in customary form with outside legal counsel for the
providing Party, if requested. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.1.3| Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party
shall give the other prompt notice of any pending or threatened request,
inquiry, or Action brought by any of the Relevant Antitrust Authorities, or
brought by a third party under any of the Antitrust Laws, in each case with
respect to the Transactions, including with regard to any Remedy Action as
defined in Clauses 13.1.5 and 13.1.6 herein (an "Antitrust Investigation").
With respect to any such Antitrust Investigation, and subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 63 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

appropriate agreements to limit disclosure to outside counsel and consultants
retained by such counsel and to preserve the attorney-client or other legal
privileges, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) keep the
other informed as to the status of any such Antitrust Investigation, (ii)
promptly inform the other of any communication (excluding non-material
communications) to or from the European Commission, the United States Federal
Trade Commission, United States Department of Justice or any of the Relevant
Antitrust Authorities, in connection with any such Antitrust Investigation
(and, if in writing, furnish the other with a copy of such communication),
(iii) give the other reasonable advance notice of all meetings or
teleconferences (excluding non-material teleconferences) with any of
the Relevant Antitrust Authorities in connection with any such Antitrust
Investigation and, to the extent not prohibited by Law and permitted by the
Relevant Antitrust Authorities, gives the other, including its outside
counsel, an opportunity to attend and participate and (iv) consult in advance
and cooperate with the other and consider in good faith the views of the other
in connection with (including providing reasonable opportunity for the other

The Parties further agree that materials provided pursuant to this clause 13
may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (y) as is necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as is necessary to
address reasonable legal privilege concerns.

  



   | 13.1.4| In the event that any Action is commenced challenging the
Transactions as violating any Antitrust Law, each Party shall cooperate with
each other in good faith and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order resulting therefrom, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions; provided, however, that the obligations in
this clause 13 shall expire as of the Long Stop Date. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 13.1.5| Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take
all actions necessary to promptly, and in any event prior to the Long Stop
Date, (a) secure Antitrust Clearance and (b) resolve any objections asserted
with respect to the Transactions under applicable Antitrust Laws raised by any
Relevant Antitrust Authority, in each case, to the extent necessary in order
to prevent the entry of any Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or
delay the consummation of the Transactions, including agreeing to (1) sell,
divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold
separate and sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber before or after the consummation of the Transactions, any assets,

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

product lines, businesses or interest therein of the Company and any of its
Affiliates and Subsidiaries or the Buyer and any of its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries (and to provide consent to any such sale, divestiture, lease,
license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by the Company and any of
its Affiliates and Subsidiaries or the Buyer and any of its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries of any of their respective assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interest therein), (2) any material
changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or
other impairment of the Buyer's, the Company's or any of their respective
Affiliates' and Subsidiaries' ability to own or operate, any such assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein
or the Buyer's ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or
otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the capital stock of
the Company and (3) other structural, behavioral or conduct relief with
respect to the behavior of the Buyer or the Company and any of their
Affiliates and Subsidiaries, provided, however, that any such actions with
respect to the Company and any of its Affiliates and Subsidiaries is
conditioned on the occurrence of, or shall become effective only upon and
after, the consummation of the Offer (collectively, the actions described in
the preceding clauses (1), (2) and (3), the "Remedy Actions").
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not agree to (other than at the written request of the
Buyer, in which case the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (subject to the
proviso at the end of the definition of Remedy Actions)) undertake any such
Remedy Action, taken together with all other Remedy Actions undertaken with
respect to the matters contemplated by this clause 13, which would reasonably
be expected to result in a Substantial Detriment.  "Substantial Detriment"
means: (A) any Remedy Action with respect to the business set forth on
Schedule 13-A, or (B) any Remedy Actions contemplated by clause (1) or (2) to
the extent such Remedy Actions, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in, require or constitute a Specified Effect;
provided, that any Remedy Action with respect to the products set forth on
Schedule 13-B (the "Buyer Specified Business") shall not be deemed to be a
Substantial Detriment.

  



   | 13.1.6| Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if reasonably requested by the Buyer so as to permit (or as identified by the
Buyer as reasonably likely to be necessary to permit) the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or to
secure approval of the Transactions under the EU Merger Regulation and to
obtain Antitrust Clearance, and resolve any objections asserted with respect
to the Transactions under any applicable Antitrust Laws or by the Relevant
Antitrust Authorities, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to, as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of such
request, agree to any Remedy Action with respect to assets or businesses of
the Company or its Affiliates and Subsidiaries; provided, however, that any
such Remedy Action (each, a "Potential Company 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 65 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Remedy Action") is conditioned on the occurrence of, or shall become
effective only upon and after, the consummation of the Offer. In furtherance
of the foregoing, to the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the
Buyer to facilitate any Potential Company Remedy Action, including by, to
the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, (a) entering into
confidentiality agreements containing customary terms with any Persons whom
the Buyer identifies to the Company as potential purchasers in a Potential
Company Remedy Action (such potential purchasers to be referred to as
"Potential Purchasers"), (b) permitting Potential Purchasers to conduct (and
cooperate with such Potential Purchasers') reasonable documentary and other
reasonable investigations with respect to such Potential Company Remedy
Action (provided that any such Potential Purchaser executes and delivers to
the Company a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms), (c)
complying with any applicable right of first refusal, right of first offer,
right of approval and similar provisions that may be applicable to a proposed
transfer in connection with a Potential Company Remedy Action and (d)
delivering such notices and executing such contracts relating to the Potential
Company Remedy Action as reasonably requested by the Buyer; provided,
however, that in the event that the Company reasonably asserts that anything
in this clause 13 would require the Company or any of its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries to take any action or provide any cooperation that would (i)
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the disclosure of any trade secret of any
third party or violate the terms of any confidentiality provision in any
agreement with a third party or any applicable Law or (iii) cause a risk of
loss or waiver of the protection of any attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product or other legal privilege, the Company may withhold such
cooperation; provided, that if the Company withholds such cooperation on the
basis of the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), the Company shall promptly
inform the Buyer as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the
Company and the Buyer shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure as promptly as reasonably practicable that does not suffer and
would not reasonably be expected to suffer from any of the foregoing
impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts
(without payment of any consideration, fees or expenses) to (A) obtain the
required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such
information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures
to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove the basis
for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean room
procedures, redaction of text from documents or entry into a customary joint
defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the
Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without such impediments. The Company, as it deems advisable and
necessary, may reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided
pursuant to the preceding sentence as

  



  

   

 | | 66 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

"Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. The Buyer shall
be permitted to control any sales process relating to a Potential Company
Remedy Action, including the selection of financial advisors to the Company
in connection thereto, but shall consider in good faith the views of, and
consult with, the Company in connection with any Potential Company Remedy
Action and any related sales process. The Company shall provide the Buyer, to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws, with information and access to data
and personnel reasonably necessary to permit the Buyer to (i) expeditiously
market the assets or businesses that are the subject of such Potential Company
Remedy Action, (ii) prepare, negotiate and finalize documentation effecting
such Potential Company Remedy Action and (iii) conduct and complete
discussions with the Relevant Antitrust Authorities related to such Potential
Company Remedy Action; provided that in each case such action does not
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries. The Company shall not permit any of its officers or any other
representatives or agents to participate in any material meeting or material
teleconference with any Potential Purchasers unless it consults with the
Buyer in advance and, to the extent practicable and permitted by Law,
gives the Buyer the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. The Buyer
shall provide the Company with reasonable notice prior to making any request
under this Section 13.1.6 to agree to any Potential Company Remedy Action and
assist with the implementation of such Potential Company Remedy Action.

  



   | 13.1.7| Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Buyer shall have principal responsibility for determining
the timing, sequence and strategy of seeking Antitrust Clearance, but shall
consider in good faith the views of, and consult with, the Company on such
strategy. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14| Exclusivity 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.1.1| For the purposes of this Agreement, the "Exclusivity Period"
shall mean the period commencing on the date of this Agreement and ending on
the date of a valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with clause
16.1, unless the Offer has been launched in accordance with this Agreement,
in which case the Exclusivity Period shall end on the earlier of the
Settlement Date and the date of a valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with clause 16.1. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 14.1.2| During the Exclusivity Period, except as expressly permitted
pursuant to clause 15: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the Company shall not and shall not publicly announce an

 | | 67 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

members of the Boards, shall or shall publicly announce an intention
to, directly or indirectly, approach, initiate, enter into or continue
discussions or negotiations with (other than informing Persons of the
provisions contained in this clause 14), or provide any non-public information
relating to the Group to, or otherwise approach, solicit or knowingly
encourage any third-party with respect to a potential offer or proposal that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a potential offer for
the acquisition of more than 20% of the Company Shares or assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries
of the Company and any entity surviving any merger or combination including
any of them) of the Company or its Subsidiaries representing more than 20% of
the revenues, net income or assets (in each case, on a consolidated basis) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each an "Alternative
Proposal");

  



   | (b)| the Company shall not approve or recommend, or authorize, execute
or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other contract with respect to an
Alternative Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
and shall make reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their
respective directors, officers and other Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to
any Alternative Proposal, and shall not modify, amend or terminate, or waive,
release or assign, any provisions of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement (or any similar agreement) to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party relating to any such Alternative Proposal and shall
enforce the provisions of any such agreement; provided, that the
Company shall, subject to and in accordance with clause 15 be permitted to
release or waive any such standstill obligations prior to the End of the
Acceptance Period solely to the extent necessary to permit the party
referenced therein to submit an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative
Proposal to the Boards on a confidential basis conditioned upon such Person
agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from providing any
information to the Buyer regarding any such Alternative Proposal in accordance
with the terms of this clause 14 and clause 15\. The Company shall promptly
(and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement) request each Person that has, prior to the date of this Agreement,
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
any Alternative Proposal to, in accordance with the terms of such

 | | 68 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

agreement, return or destroy all confidential information furnished prior to
the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it
shall promptly inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in
this clause 14.

  



   | 15| Competing Offer 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.1.1| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clauses
3.2 or 14, prior to the End of the Acceptance Period, in the event that the
Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal
(whereby for purposes of this clause, any reference in the definition of
"Alternative Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "fifty percent (50%)") that did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of clauses 14 or 15, made by a Person who, in the
reasonable opinion of the Company (including the Supervisory Board), is a
_bona fide_  third-party and which proposal the Boards determine in good
faith, after consultation with their outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, would reasonably be expected to become a Competing Offer,
then, the Company may take the following actions: 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (a)| the Company shall be permitted to provide non-public information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person(s) making such
Alternative Proposal, but only if (A) such Person(s) has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company containing terms at least as
restrictive to such Person(s) as the terms contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement are to the Buyer, and which shall not contain any exclusivity
provision or other term that would restrict, in any manner, the Company\'s
ability to consummate the Transactions or to comply with its disclosure
obligations to the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and (B) prior to or
contemporaneously with furnishing any such non-public information to such
Person(s), it furnishes such non-public information to the Buyer to the extent
the Buyer has not previously been provided with such information; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| the Company shall be permitted to consider such Alternative
Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding such Alternative
Proposal. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.1.2| In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
clauses 14 and 15, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any request for
non-public information or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to
lead to any Alternative Proposal, the Company shall provide the Buyer with

inquiry, and the identity of the Person(s) making any such Alternative
Proposal, request or inquiry, if not previously provided. Commencing upon the
provision of any notice referred to above and continuing until such
Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry is withdrawn, (i) the Company (or
its outside legal counsel) shall keep the Buyer (or its outside legal counsel)
reasonably informed regarding the status and material terms (including
changes to the material terms) of discussions and negotiations relating to any
such Alternative Proposal, request or inquiry (and within forty-eight (48)
hours of any changes to the status or material terms thereof) and (ii)
the Company shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within forty-
eight (48) hours following the receipt or delivery thereof), provide the
Buyer (or its outside legal counsel) with unredacted copies of all written
materials, proposals or proposed transaction agreements (including all
schedules and exhibits thereto) relating to any such Alternative Proposal.

  



   | 15.1.3| A "Competing Offer" means a bona fide unsolicited written
Alternative Proposal that is binding on the relevant third party (subject
only to the valid termination of this Agreement) and that did not result
from a breach of clauses 14 or 15 (where such breach proximately caused such
Competing Offer being received by the Company), and that the Boards have
determined in good faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel
and financial advisors), taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory, financing, certainty, timing and other relevant aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal (and taking into account any
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the Buyer): (i)
is more favorable to the Company and its shareholders, employees and other
stakeholders than the Transactions; (ii) is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms proposed; and (iii) to the extent third party
financing is required, such financing is then fully committed with available
funds certain evidenced by fully enforceable and binding financing commitments
from a financial institution of internationally recognized reputation;
provided, that for purposes of this definition of "Competing Offer", the term
"Alternative Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term herein,
except that each reference to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed to be a
reference to "fifty percent (50%)". 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 15.1.4| As soon as any of the Boards has determined that an
Alternative Proposal constitutes a Competing Offer at any time prior to the
End of the Acceptance Period, any of the Boards shall be allowed to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(x) the Company has not breached any of its material obligations under
clauses 14 and 15 (where such breach proximately caused such Competing Offer
being received by the Company);

  



  

(y) the Company shall have (A) provided to the Buyer four (4) Business Days\'
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
Competing Offer, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Competing Offer

  



  

   

 | | 70 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person(s) making the Competing Offer), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the definitive agreement in
respect thereto and all other written materials, proposals, agreements or
documents related to the Competing Offer (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or condition
of such Competing Offer shall require a new notice and a new two (2) Business
Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause (z) below, the Boards have
determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate
this Agreement in accordance with clause 16.1(g) as applicable, and the
Boards have determined, in good faith, after consultation with their outside
legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement in accordance with
clause 16.1(g) as applicable, would be inconsistent with the Boards\'
fiduciary duties under the Laws of The Netherlands and (B) prior to making
such an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminating this Agreement in
accordance with clause 16.1(g), as applicable, to the extent requested in
writing by the Buyer, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Buyer
during such four (4) or two (2) Business Day period, as applicable, to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Proposal ceases to
constitute a Competing Offer; and

  



  

(z) no earlier than the end of the four (4) or two (2) Business Day period,
as applicable, the Boards shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with their outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that, in
light of such Competing Offer and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by the Buyer, such Competing Offer continues to constitute a
Competing Offer and that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and/or terminate this Agreement in accordance with clause 16.1(g)
would continue to be inconsistent with the Boards\' fiduciary duties under
the Laws of The Netherlands.

  



   | 15.1.5| Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company, the Boards or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Company\'s shareholders a position contemplated by Rule14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or
from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder (or any similar communication to shareholders in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer),
and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change if such disclosure is made in accordance with clause
3.2(c)(ii) (provided, however, that if such disclosure has the effect of
withdrawing or adversely modifying or qualifying the Company
Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change), (ii) disclosing in accordance with applicable
disclosure requirements under Law to the Company\'s shareholders 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 71 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

any factual information regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company, (iii) to the extent required by
Applicable Rules, disclosing the fact that an Alternative Proposal has been
made, the identity of the party making such Alternative Proposal or the
material terms of such Alternative Proposal, or other information required by
applicable Law (and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change if such disclosure does not have the effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying or qualifying the Company
Recommendation) or (iv) communicating with any Person (or the Representatives
of such Person) that makes any Alternative Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry to
the extent necessary to direct such Person to the provisions of this clause 15
and/or to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of an Alternative
Proposal made by such Person; provided, however, that the Company Board shall
not be permitted to make any Adverse Recommendation Change except in
accordance with clauses 3.4 or 15.1.4.

   | 17.1.2| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (a) in the event that the Buyer shall receive full payment of the

Agreement, the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for any

   | 17.2| Reverse Termination Payment 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.2.1| The Buyer shall pay to the Company, within five (5) calendar
days of a first written request from the Company a termination payment equal
to $575 million (the "Reverse Termination Payment") in cash, exclusive of
VAT, if any, if this Agreement is validly terminated by (i) the Buyer pursuant
to clause 16.1(h) if such termination is based upon or relating to any Order
or other Law that is either an Antitrust Law or is based upon, promulgated
under or issued pursuant to Antitrust Laws; provided the issuance of any such
final and nonappealable Order, decree, ruling or other action was not
attributable to, and proximately caused by, a failure on the part of the
Company to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in
clause 13 of this Agreement required to be performed by it, or (ii) the Buyer
or the Company pursuant to clause 16.1(d) because the Offer Condition set out
in clause 4.1.1(b) is not satisfied due to the absence of Antitrust Clearance
from the Relevant Antitrust Authorities, or waived, by the Long Stop Date, or
as a result of any final and nonappealable Order, decree, ruling or other
action or other Law that is either an Antitrust Law or is based upon,
promulgated under or issued pursuant to Antitrust Laws (provided the issuance
of any such final and nonappealable Order, decree, ruling or other action
was not attributable to, and proximately caused by, a failure on the part of
the Company to perform in any material respect any covenant or obligation in
clause 13 of this Agreement required to be performed by it) and each of the
other Offer Conditions has been satisfied at the time of termination or as of
the End of the Acceptance Period, as applicable; provided, that (a) failure to
satisfy the Offer Condition set out in clause 4.1.1(b) was not proximately
caused by a material breach by the Company under clause 13 and (b) no failure
of an Offer Condition to be satisfied shall relieve Buyer from its obligation
to pay the Reverse Termination Payment if such failure was proximately caused
by a material breach by the Buyer under this Agreement (subclause (i) and (ii)
hereunder collectively being referred to as "Antitrust Termination"). If (A)
the Buyer pays the Reverse Termination Payment in accordance with this clause
17.2, and (B) prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months from the date of
the Antitrust Termination, the Company or any of its Affiliates enters into a
definitive and binding contract that includes all the terms for any
transaction specified in the definition of "Alternative Proposal," (whereby
for purposes of this clause any reference in the definition of "Alternative
Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed a reference to
"fifty percent (50%)"), on terms and conditions that constitute a "Threshold
Value Contract" (as defined below) (such transaction, a "Threshold Value
Transaction"), and (C) such Threshold Value Transaction is subsequently
consummated, then the Company shall on the date on which such Threshold Value
Transaction is consummated, pay to the Buyer, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 76 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

a payment in the amount equal to either (i) the Reverse Termination Payment
received by the Company if the Company or any of its Affiliates has entered
into a definitive and binding contract that includes all the terms for a
Threshold Value Transaction within twelve (12) months following the Antitrust
Termination or (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the Reverse Termination Payment
received by the Company, if the Company has entered into a definitive and
binding contract that includes all the terms for a Threshold Value
Transaction between twelve (12) months and fifteen (15) months following the
Antitrust Termination, in each case, subject to the other terms and condition
of this clause 17.2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall not
be entitled to any repayment of the Reverse Termination Payment or any
portion thereof if (i) failure to satisfy the Offer Condition set out in
clause 4.1.1(b) was proximately caused by a material breach by the Buyer of
clause 13, (ii) following the termination of this Agreement, the Buyer makes
a proposal to acquire the Company or knowingly encourages the Company's
management, Managing Board, or Supervisory Board to initiate a process to sell
itself that results in the Company or any of its Affiliates entering into a
definitive and binding contract that includes all the terms for a Threshold
Value Transaction or (iii) the Buyer takes any action to materially delay the
Company or its applicable Affiliate from entering into or subsequently
consummating the Threshold Value Transaction, including, without limitation,
any filing, submission or appeal to a Governmental Authority seeking to delay
or impede the transaction underlying the Threshold Value Transaction or
initiating any Action with respect to the transaction underlying the Threshold
Value Transaction (other than any Action relating in any way to this
Agreement or the Transactions).

  



  

A "Threshold Value Contract" means a binding contract with a third party,
other than the Buyer or any Affiliates of the Company or the Buyer, that
includes all the terms for any transaction specified in the definition of
"Alternative Proposal" (whereby for purposes of this definition of Threshold
Value Contract any reference in the definition of "Alternative Proposal" to
"twenty percent (20%)" shall be deemed a reference to "fifty percent (50%)")
and that provides for a purchase price in cash and/or stock on a per Company
Share basis as of the date of execution of such Threshold Value Contract
representing no less than a 10% cumulative annual growth rate on the Offer
Consideration (as of the date hereof) measured from the date hereof until the
date on which the Company or any of its Affiliates enters into a binding
contract for any transaction specified in the definition of such Alternative
Proposal. For purposes of this clause, in the event that, during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the date the Company or any of its
Affiliates enters into a binding contract for any transaction specified in the
definition of Alternative Proposal (i) the number of outstanding Company
Shares is changed into a different number of Company Shares as a result of a
reclassification, stock split, including a reverse stock split, capital
increase through company funds, stock dividend or distribution,

  



  

   

 | | 77 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

recapitalization, stock buyback or other similar transaction, then the Offer
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect
such change and (ii) the value of any milestone, contingent value right, or
any deferred or contingent payments or other consideration in any such
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be included at the estimated fair
value for purposes of determining the consideration offered by the Threshold
Value Transaction.

  



   | 17.2.2| Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (a) in the event that the Company shall receive full payment of
the termination payment pursuant to this clause 17.2, the receipt of such
payment shall substitute for payment of any and all losses or damages
suffered or incurred by the Company or its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions (or the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination of this
Agreement, the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for any
breach or failure to perform hereunder or in connection with this Agreement
or otherwise, and none of the Company or its Affiliates shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or the Buyer Related Parties arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, any of the Transactions (or the abandonment thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination and (b) the Company\'s
right to receive the termination payment pursuant to this clause 17.2
shall be the sole and exclusive claim for monetary damages of the Company or
its Affiliates against the Buyer, each of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners,
stockholders, optionholders, managers, employees, members, Affiliates, agents
or advisors (collectively, "Buyer Related Parties") for any losses or damages
suffered or incurred as a result of, arising out of or in connection with the
termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or in connection
with this Agreement or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount(s), none of
the Buyer Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation,
actual or contingent or otherwise relating to or arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall release any Party from liability arising out of any Fraud or
Willful Breach by such Party of any covenant or obligation of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the Buyer be required to pay the Reverse Termination Payment on
more than one occasion.

   | 17.3| Termination Payment and Tax 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.3.1| Parties shall take the position that any termination payment
as referred to in clauses 17.1 and 17.2 is (i) not treated as a supply of
goods or a supply of services under the Law governing VAT of any applicable
European Union member state or (ii) otherwise exempt from VAT. Each Party
shall act in a manner 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

 | | 78 / 107

consistent with the foregoing (including filing Tax Returns consistent
therewith) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to contest any
contrary position in a Tax audit or similar proceeding.

  



   | 17.3.2| Any claim or defence by a Party for offset, withholding, or
any other reduction or negation of any termination payment described in
clauses 17.1 and 17.2 (including any repayment thereof), whether for breach or
any other reason, may be pursued only in the form of a refund of (part of)
such payment from the other Party after it has been made, which payment must
be made according to the terms of this clause 17. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.3.3| Notwithstanding clause 17.3, if any VAT is due by the Company
in respect of any termination payment referred to in clause 17.1 by way of
reverse charge mechanism ( _BTW verleggingsregeling_ ), such VAT shall be for
the account of the Company. In no event shall any VAT be deducted from the
termination payment as referred to in clause 17.1.1 or added to the Reverse
Termination Payment, and the Buyer shall be under no obligation to reimburse
the Company for any such VAT levied from the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.4| Specific Performance and Related Provisions 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.4.1| Each Party shall have the right to demand specific performance
( _nakoming vorderen_ ) of the provisions of this Agreement by the Company or
the Buyer, as the case may be. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.4.2| The provisions of Section 6:92, paragraphs 1 and 3 of the DCC
shall, to the maximum extent possible, not apply. Each Party hereby waives
any (potential) right it might have to request mitigation of such liability in
any manner (in legal proceedings or otherwise). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 17.4.3| Unless explicitly provided otherwise in this Agreement, any
payment obligation of the Company or the Buyer under clauses 17.1 and 17.2
shall exist regardless of whether there is an attributable failure (
_toerekenbare tekortkoming_ ) by the Company or the Buyer, as the case may
be.

   | 19| Assignment 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 19.1| No Assignment 
---|---|--- 
  



  

With the exception of clauses 19.2 and 19.3, none of the Parties can assign,
delegate or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement

---|---|--- 
  



  

The Buyer is entitled to assign any and all of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement, with the exception of its rights and obligations under

jointly and severally liable with the designated assignee for the proper
performance of any obligations assigned to the designated assignee under this
clause 19.2.

  



   | 19.3| Assignment to Affiliates by the Company after Liquidation or

and consents and the passing of all resolutions reasonably required, to

provisions of this clause 19.3.

  



  

   

 | | 81 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | 20| Costs 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except where this Agreement provides otherwise, each Party shall pay its own
costs relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and any documents executed pursuant thereto.

  



   | 21| No waiver 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The rights of any Party shall not be prejudiced or restricted by any
indulgence or forbearance extended to any other Party and no waiver by any
Party in respect of any breach shall operate as a waiver in respect of any
subsequent breach. No single or partial exercise of any right preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. No provision of this
Agreement may be waived or extended except by a written instrument signed by
the Party against whom the waiver or extension is to be effective.

  



   | 22| No recission 
---|---|--- 
  



  

To the extent permitted by Law, the Parties waive their rights, if any, to
(i) in whole or in part annul, rescind or dissolve (including any

demand in legal proceedings the annulment, rescission or dissolution in whole
or in part of this Agreement, including on the basis of Section 7:17 of the
DCC and (ii) invoke Section 6:228 of the DCC in the sense that an error (
_dwaling_ ) shall remain for the risk and account of the Party in error as
referred to in Section 6:228, subsection 2 of the DCC. Furthermore, each of
the Parties waives its rights, if any, to in whole or in part seek the
alteration of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6:230 of the DCC.

  



   | 23| Further assurances 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Parties undertake to each other to execute and perform all such deeds,
documents, assurances, acts and things and to exercise all powers and rights
available to them, in whatever capacity, including the giving of all waivers
and consents and the passing of all resolutions reasonably required to ensure
that the Parties and their Representatives give effect to the provisions of
this Agreement.

  



   | 24| Invalidity 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If any term, covenant, provision or restriction of this Agreement is or is
held to be invalid, void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other Governmental Authority, then so far as it is invalid, void or
unenforceable it has no effect and is deemed not to be included in this
Agreement. This shall not invalidate any of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement, to the extent that, given this Agreement\'s substance and purpose,
such remainder is not

  



  

   

 | | 82 / 107 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

inextricably related to the (wholly or partially) invalid, void or
unenforceable provision. The Parties shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable provision by a
valid provision the effect of which is as close as possible to the intended
effect of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision.

  



   | 25| Third-party rights 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Except as set out in clauses 6.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3, 8 and 10.2.2 this Agreement
does not contain any stipulation in favour of any third-party ( _derdenbeding_

Letter), together with the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire
agreement between and understanding of the Parties in respect of the Offer

applicable Law) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or
in good standing when taken together with all other such failures,

to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate, company or similar power and
authority to own and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power
or authority when taken together with all other such failures, individually or

to provide funds to, or to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise, which does not include providing credit for trade
payables) in, any other Person (other than as contemplated by the
Transactions).
