In the event a Company Product is sold as part of a Combination Product in a

multiplying the Net Sales amount for the Combination Product during the
applicable reporting period, calculated as set forth above, by the fraction
A/(A+B), where A is the weighted average sale price (by sales volume) of the
Company Product when sold separately, and B is the weighted average sales
price of the other active ingredient(s) or product(s) in the Combination
Product when sold separately, in each case in the same dosage and dosage form
and in the same country as the Combination Product during the applicable
reporting period. In the event that a generic version of the other active
ingredient(s) or product(s) included as B is launched in the current period,
then the fraction A/(A+B) would revert to the most recent calculation prior to
the generic launch and remain constant for the duration of the applicable
reporting period. If the other active ingredient(s) or product(s) in the
Combination Product (i.e., other than the Company Product) is not sold
separately during the applicable reporting period in a country, Net Sales
shall be calculated by multiplying actual Net Sales of such Combination
Product by a fraction A/C where A is the weighted average sale price (by sales
volume) of the Company Product in such country when sold separately, and C is
the weighted average sale price (by sales volume) of the Combination Product
in such country. If neither the Company Product nor the other active
ingredient(s) or

 product(s) were sold separately during the applicable reporting period, then
the respective average sales prices during the most recent reporting period in
which sales of both occurred in the same country as the Combination Product
shall be used. In the event that the weighted average sale price (by sales
volume) of the Company Product is not available in a given country for any
reporting period (including if the Company Product is not sold separately
during the applicable reporting period in a country), then the average sales
prices (weighted by sales volume) of the respective products described above
(in the same dosage and dosage form as the Combination Product) in a proxy
country as agreed upon by both Parties will be used (such agreement not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and if the Parties cannot
agree upon such proxy country, or no such comparable sales figures are
available in an appropriate proxy country, Net Sales for the applicable
Combination Product shall be allocated based on the relative value contributed
by each component (such relative value as agreed upon by the Parties or, if
the Parties cannot agree, to be determined by the dispute resolution
procedures set forth on Schedule 1.1(g).

and without any action on the part of the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company

including, for the avoidance of doubt, Shares of Company Common Stock subject
to Company Options to the extent exercised at least one (1) day prior to the

certificate representing any such Shares ("Certificates") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive amounts payable

of whether such holder's Certificates are delivered at Closing. From and after
the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of

 transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of capital stock of the Company which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(whether vested or unvested) shall be canceled and extinguished at the
Effective Time and shall be converted into the right to receive payment from
the Purchaser (such aggregate amount, the "Company Option Consideration") (A)

agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, subject to such
adjustments to which the Parties reasonably agree (an "Option Surrender
Agreement").

(iii) Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of
the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common
Stock") shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
("Surviving Corporation Common Stock"). Each certificate representing
outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall at the Effective Time
represent an equal number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all Shares that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock and all Shares that are owned by the Purchaser
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Purchaser or
Merger Sub or the holders of securities thereof, be automatically canceled and
retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist and no payment
or other consideration shall be made or delivered with respect thereto.

Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is
held by a Stockholder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 2.2(f)(i) but shall be
entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that

 if such Stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses the
right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, each Share of such Stockholder
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section
2.2(f)(i), and such Share shall no longer be a Dissenting Share.

(ii) The Company shall give the Purchaser prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other instruments
served pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL relating to the
appraisal process received by the Company. The Company shall direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Purchaser shall have the
opportunity to participate with the Company in any and all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demand. Prior to the Effective Time, neither
the Company nor the Purchaser shall, without the prior written consent of the
other Party, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal and will not, settle or offer to settle such demands.

(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate or other instruments representing
Shares shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen, or destroyed and, to the extent required by Purchaser in its sole
discretion, such Persons agreeing to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser
from and against any losses in connection therewith, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed certificate or instrument, the
consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(f).

(j) Exchange Procedures. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent or the Company shall provide to each
Stockholder a letter of transmittal and instructions to the letter of
transmittal for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
otherwise complying with Section 4.1(b)) in exchange for the payment of the
consideration described in Section 2.2(f)(i), in substantially the form of
Exhibit C hereto (the "Letter of Transmittal"); provided, that no later than
seven (7) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have
delivered to Purchaser such information as may be reasonably requested by the
Paying Agent in connection with distribution of the Letters of Transmittal.

to the Stockholders at Closing under Sections 2.2(f)(i)(1)(A), Section
2.2(f)(i)(2)(A) and (B), and Section 2.2(f)(i)(3)(A) and (B).

(i) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall make cash payments to, or on behalf
of, the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the Company prior to the Closing Date, in an
aggregate amount necessary to enable the Company to pay and satisfy the

Payroll Taxes on the Closing Date, in each case in the amounts set forth on
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet (provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, amounts payable in respect of the Change of Control Payments shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation for further distribution directly to the

held and used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Holder
Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement and
the agreements ancillary hereto. The Participating Holders will not receive

negligence or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative will hold the

Reimbursement Set-Aside (or any remaining portion thereof) for its operating
expenses or any other corporate

 purposes and will not voluntarily make the Representative Reimbursement Set-
Aside (or any remaining portion thereof) available to its creditors in the
event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Holder Representative's responsibilities, any remaining balance of the
Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside shall be distributed by the Holder
Representative to the Participating Holders pro rata based on their respective
Participating Holder Percentages as follows: (A) deposit the portion of such
remaining amount payable to the Stockholders with the Paying Agent for payment
directly to the Stockholders (pro rata in accordance with their respective
Participating Holder Percentages) and (B) deposit the portion of such
remaining amount payable to the holders of Company Options that are
outstanding at the Effective Time with the Surviving Corporation, for further
distribution directly to the holders of such Company Options (pro rata in
accordance with their respective Participating Holder Percentages) or, if
applicable, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system. For tax
purposes, the Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside will be treated as having
been received and voluntarily set aside by the Participating Holders at the
time of Closing.

(iii) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deposit in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Deposit,
to be held in trust by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an Escrow Agreement in a
form to be mutually agreed by the parties hereto, which the Purchaser, the
Holder Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders) and the Escrow
Agent shall execute and deliver simultaneously with the Closing (the "Escrow
Agreement").

(b) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall direct the Paying Agent to make (on

such Stockholder\'s Letter of Transmittal, in an amount equal to the portion
of the Closing Consideration that such Stockholder is entitled to hereunder in
respect of the Shares held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Paying Agent shall not be required to pay any amount of
the Merger Consideration to a particular Stockholder until receipt from such
Stockholder of the Stockholder Materials. In the event that any Stockholder
delivers its Stockholder Materials to the Purchaser after the Effective Time,
the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) Business
Days after delivery of the Stockholder Materials) direct the Paying Agent to
make a cash payment to each Stockholder who has so delivered the Stockholder
Materials to the Purchaser, by wire transfer in immediately available funds or
by check, as designated in writing by such Stockholder to the Paying Agent in
such Stockholder\'s Letter of Transmittal, in an amount equal to the portion
of the Closing Consideration that such Stockholder is entitled to hereunder in

Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make a cash payment

Consideration that such holder of Company Options is entitled to hereunder in
respect of the Company Options held by such holder of Company Options at the
Effective Time and converted to a right to receive payment accordance with
Section 2.2(f)(ii); provided that, such payment will be conditioned on

(d) (i) Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver for purposes of the payments to be made in connection
with Closing and (ii) no later than five (5) Business Days following receipt
of a written request from Purchaser in connection with a post-Closing payment
to the Participating Holders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Holder Representative shall deliver, in each case, to the Purchaser and the
Paying Agent a consideration spreadsheet in the form attached hereto as
Schedule 4.1(d) (the "Allocation Schedule"), which Allocation Schedule (a)
shall be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Company's
Organizational Documents, (b) in the case of an Allocation Schedule to be
prepared and delivered in connection with a post-Closing payment, shall set
forth (i) Additional Transaction Expenses (provided the Holder Representative
may rely on the aggregate amount of the Development Milestone Payment or
Commercial Milestone Payment provided by Purchaser to the Holder
Representative for such calculation), if any and (ii) updated payment or wire
information for the Participating Holders, if such information is different
from the information set forth on such Participating Holder's Letter of
Transmittal and (c) shall contain (i) the mailing addresses and, if known to
the Company or the Holder Representative, as the case may be, email addresses
for each Participating Holder; (ii) in the case of the Stockholders, (A) the
number of each class or series of Shares owned by each Stockholder, and (B)

(iii) in the case of the holders of Company Options, (A) the number of Shares
subject to such Company Options, (B) the portion of such Company Options that
constitute incentive stock options and (C) an indication of whether such
holder is, as of the date such Allocation Schedule is delivered, an employee
or independent contractor subject to reporting on IRS Form 1099 or IRS Form
W-2; (iv) the portion of the Closing Consideration attributable to such
Participating Holder's Shares and Company Options; (v) in the case of any
Allocation Schedule to be prepared and delivered in connection with a post-
Closing payment, the portion of any post-Closing payment payable to each
Participating Holder (provided the Holder Representative may rely on the
aggregate amount of the Development Milestone Payment or Commercial Milestone
Payment provided by Purchaser to the Holder Representative for such
calculation); and (vi) each Participating Holder's Participating Holder
Percentage. The Holder Representative shall provide any other information
reasonably required by Paying Agent to complete required cost basis tax
reporting, which may include date of acquisition, cost basis and covered/non-
covered status ("Cost Basis Information"). Each of the Parties hereto agree
that (1) the Purchaser and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely on the
Allocation Schedule

 and Cost Basis Information for all payments made hereunder and shall not bear
any responsibility or Liability with respect to inaccuracies or errors in the
Allocation Schedule or Cost Basis Information and (2) neither the Company nor
any Stockholder shall have any recourse or redress against the Purchaser or
the Paying Agent for any payments hereunder made in reliance on the Allocation
Schedule or Cost Basis Information or any Letter of Transmittal, or may bring
any claim against the Purchaser or the Paying Agent for any payment hereunder
made in reliance on the Allocation Schedule or Cost Basis Information or any

4.2. Estimated Closing Balance Sheet.

(a) Not later than the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an estimated Closing
Balance Sheet (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall include the
Company's good faith calculations of the Estimated Closing Liability Amount
and the Estimated Closing Cash Amount. The Company shall promptly provide all
invoices, evidence and other information reasonably requested by the Purchaser
in connection with its review of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and shall
consider in good faith and incorporate the Purchaser's reasonable comments
into the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet.

(b) On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall make available to the Company,
from a portion of the Closing Consideration, the amount of cash in immediately
available funds necessary to enable the Company to pay and satisfy the
Transaction Expenses, Change of Control Payments and the Transaction Closing
Payroll Taxes on the Closing Date, and the Company shall utilize such amounts
to pay and satisfy the Transaction Expenses and Change of Control Payments and
Transaction Closing Payroll Taxes on the Closing Date, subject to Section 4.4.
Any Transaction Expenses, Change of Control Payments or Transaction Closing
Payroll Taxes not included in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet will be
included in the Final Closing Liability Amount.

4.3. Post-Closing Adjustment to Closing Consideration.

(a) Within ninety (90) days subsequent to the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Holder Representative an adjusted Closing
Balance Sheet (the "Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall include the
Purchaser's good faith calculations of the Closing Liability Amount and the
Closing Cash Amount, together with documentation setting forth, in reasonable
detail, any differences between the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet and the basis for such difference.

(b) Upon receipt of the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet, the Holder
Representative shall have thirty (30) days to review the Adjusted Closing
Balance Sheet. The Purchaser shall afford the Holder Representative and its
advisors reasonable access to the books and records of the Company, and to the
appropriate personnel at the Company, upon reasonable prior notice and during
normal business hours, for purposes of confirming the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet. Unless the Holder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice (as defined
below) to the Purchaser within such thirty (30) day period, the Holder
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet and such Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet shall be conclusive and binding
on the Purchaser, the Holder Representative and the Participating Holders.

 (c) If the Holder Representative believes that the Adjusted Closing Balance
Sheet was not prepared in accordance with this Agreement, the Holder
Representative may notify the Purchaser of such exception in writing,
including the basis of the objection for each item and the proposed adjustment
(a "Dispute Notice") on or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day after the Holder
Representative's receipt of the Adjusted Closing Balance Sheet. Unless
resolved by the Purchaser and the Holder Representative within thirty (30)
days thereafter, either the Holder Representative or the Company may elect to
submit such exception or exceptions to a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm (the "Neutral Auditor"). The Neutral Auditor shall be a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm selected by mutual agreement
of the Purchaser and the Holder Representative or, in the absence of such
mutual agreement, by a firm of nationally recognized independent public
accountants selected by lot after eliminating the Company's principal outside
accountants prior to the Closing and Purchaser's principal outside
accountants. Each Party agrees to execute a reasonable engagement letter, if
requested to do so by the Neutral Auditor. All fees and expenses relating to
the work performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be borne by the Purchaser or
the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders) based on
the inverse proportion of (x) the portion of the Neutral Auditor's
determination (before such allocation) successfully awarded to such Party and
(y) the total amount of the Neutral Auditor's determination (before such
allocation) as originally submitted to the Neutral Auditor. For example,
should items in dispute total One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) and the Neutral
Auditor awards Six Hundred Dollars ($600) in favor of the Holder
Representative's position, sixty percent (60%) of the fees and expenses of the
Neutral Auditor's review would be borne by the Purchaser and forty percent
(40%) of the fees and expenses would be borne by the Holder Representative.
The Neutral Auditor, as promptly as practicable after their selection (and the
Purchaser and the Holder Representative shall instruct the Neutral Auditor to
complete its calculation and determination of the Final Closing Liability
Amount or Final Closing Cash Amount within thirty (30) days after being
retained), shall make a determination of all issues in dispute pursuant to
this Agreement and GAAP, which determination shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to the Purchaser and the Holder Representative and shall
be binding and conclusive on the Purchaser, the Participating Holders and the
Holder Representative for all purposes under this Agreement, absent fraud or
manifest error. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the
Neutral Auditor: (i) the Holder Representative and the Purchaser shall have a
reasonable opportunity to meet with the Neutral Auditor to provide their views
as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Liability Amount and/or the Closing Cash Amount. In determining the Closing
Liability Amount or Closing Cash Amount that is the subject of a dispute
hereunder, (A) the Neutral Auditor shall be limited to addressing only those
particular disputed items referred to in the Dispute Notice, and (B) such
calculation shall, with respect to any disputed item, be no greater than the
higher amount calculated by the Purchaser or the Holder Representative, as the
case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by the Purchaser or
the Holder Representative, as the case may be. Any such Closing Liability
Amount or Final Closing Cash Amount shall reflect in detail the differences,
if any, between the Purchaser's calculation as reflected in the Adjusted
Closing Balance Sheet and the Dispute Notice as set forth in the Neutral
Auditor's determination of such amounts.

(d) If the Final Closing Liability Amount is greater than the Estimated
Closing Liability Amount (such excess, the "Liability Excess Amount") or the
Final Closing Cash Amount is less than the Estimated Closing Cash Amount (such
shortfall, "Cash Shortfall Amount"), then

 the Purchaser shall be entitled to receive, pursuant to Section 4.3(f), an
aggregate amount equal to the sum of (1) the Liability Excess Amount, if any,
plus (2) the Cash Shortfall Amount, if any (the "Negative Adjustment Amount").

(e) If the Final Closing Liability Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Liability Amount (such shortfall, the "Liability Shortfall Amount") or the
Final Closing Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash Amount (such
excess amount, the "Cash Excess Amount"), then each Participating Holder shall
be entitled (after complying with the requirements described in Section
4.1(b)) to receive, pursuant to Section 4.3(f), its Participating Holder
Percentage of an aggregate amount equal to sum of the (i) Liability Shortfall
Amount, if any, and (ii) the Cash Excess Amount, if any (the "Positive
Adjustment Amount").

(f) Within five (5) Business Days following the first to occur of (i) the
acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Holder Representative, as
evidenced by written notice thereof to the Purchaser, (ii) the deemed
acceptance of the Closing Balance Sheet by the Holder Representative pursuant
to Section 4.3(b), or (iii) the resolution of the Parties or the delivery of
the statement of the Neutral Auditor pursuant to Section 4.3(c), (A) if the
Negative Adjustment Amount exceeds the Positive Adjustment Amount, the Holder
Representative and the Purchaser shall deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser an amount equal to such excess
from the Escrowed Funds or (B) if the Positive Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Negative Adjustment Amount, the Purchaser shall (1) deposit with the Paying
Agent the portion of such excess payable to the Stockholders, for further
disbursement to the Stockholders (pro rata in accordance with their respective
Participating Holder Percentages) and (2) deposit the portion of such excess
payable to the holders of Company Options that are outstanding at the
Effective Time with the Surviving Corporation, for further distribution
directly to the holders of such Company Options (pro rata in accordance with
their respective Participating Holder Percentages) or, if applicable, through
the Surviving Corporation's payroll system.

4.4. Transfer Taxes; Withholding of Tax.

(a) All transfer, sale and use, registration, documentary recording, value
added, stamp and similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred, imposed, assessed or payable in connection with or as a result of
this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the
"Transfer Taxes") shall be borne equally by the Participating Holders and the
Purchaser, and the Person(s) legally responsible for filing the Tax Returns
related to such Transfer Taxes shall properly file on a timely basis all
necessary Tax Returns, reports, forms and other documentation with respect to
any Transfer Taxes; provided that any Tax penalties and interest shall be
borne solely by the Person legally responsible therefor.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement (but subject to the
provisions of the final sentence of this Section 4.4(b)), each of the
Purchaser, Paying Agent, Company and Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amount, if any, as the Purchaser, Paying Agent, Company or Surviving
Corporation (or any Affiliate thereof), as applicable, is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation and paid over to the appropriate

 Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Shares or
Company Options, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Purchaser, Paying Agent, Company or Surviving
Corporation, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any compensatory amounts payable pursuant to or contemplated by
this Agreement shall be remitted to the Company for payment to the applicable
recipient through regular payroll procedures.

4.5. Unclaimed Amounts. Any portion of the Closing Consideration that remains
undistributed to the Participating Holders on the date that is one year after
the Effective Time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be
delivered to the Purchaser, upon demand. Any Participating Holders who have
not theretofore complied with Section 4.1(b) (including any holders of Company
Options that are outstanding at the Effective Time who have not theretofore
delivered their Option Surrender Agreements) shall thereafter look only to the
Purchaser for payment of the Merger Consideration payable to such
Participating Holder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
IV, none of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any Participating Holder for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

4.6. Further Assurances. If at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation determines that any deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or the Purchaser
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or the
Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement. At any time or
from time to time after the Closing, each of the Parties hereto shall, at the
expense of the Party making such request, execute and deliver such other
documents and instruments, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as may reasonably be necessary, proper or advisable, to the
extent permitted by law, to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

4.7. Milestone Payments.

(a) Development Milestones. Subject to Sections 4.1(b) and 4.4, Purchaser
shall make the payments described in Table 1 below less (i) any Additional
Transaction Expenses payable in connection with such payment and (ii) the

in connection with such payment (each, a "Development Milestone Payment")
following achievement or first occurrence by the Company, its Affiliates, or a

disbursement to the Participating Holders (pro rata in accordance with their
respective Participating Holder Percentages) as promptly as practicable (and
in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Paying Agent's or

Corporation for further distribution directly to the holders of such Company

(i) Each Commercial Milestone Payment is payable only once. In no event shall

the number of times the Company Products achieve the corresponding Commercial
Milestone Event.

(ii) The Purchaser shall pay to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, for further disbursement to the Participating Holders (pro rata
in accordance with their respective Participating Holder Percentages), the
applicable Commercial Milestone Payment within ninety (90) days (or seventy-

of (i) the JandJ Calendar Quarter in which the milestone was achieved or (ii) if
applicable, the delivery by the Neutral Auditor of an audit report containing
a final determination of the Neutral Auditor that any Commercial Milestone
Event has been achieved. Each such payment will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Paying Agent for further disbursement to
the Participating Holders, or, in the case of holders of Company Options that
are outstanding at the Effective Time to the Surviving Corporation for further
distribution directly to the holders of such Company Options, or, if
applicable, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system.

(i) If more than one Commercial Milestone Event described in this Section
4.7(b) is achieved during the same JandJ Calendar Year, the Purchaser shall pay
each Commercial Milestone Payment that corresponds to such Commercial
Milestone Events.

 (ii) With respect to sales of Company Products reported in a currency other
than US dollar, such amounts and the amounts payable hereunder shall be
expressed in US dollar equivalent calculated using the following method:

(1) For each upcoming JandJ Calendar Year, Purchaser shall provide a JandJ
Currency Hedge Rate(s) to be used for the local currency of each country in
which Net Sales are reasonably expected in writing to Holder Representative
(A) not later than ten (10) Business Days after the JandJ Currency Hedge Rate(s)
are available from the Purchaser's treasury Affiliate which is customarily at
the beginning of December, or (B) promptly following Net Sales in any country
for which a JandJ Currency Hedge Rate for such JandJ Calendar Year was not
previously provided. Such JandJ Currency Hedge Rate(s) will remain constant
throughout the applicable JandJ Calendar Year. Purchaser shall use the JandJ
Currency Hedge Rate(s) to convert reported Net Sales to US dollars.

(c) Net Sales Reporting and Audit Rights.

(i) Until the earlier of (i) all Commercial Milestone Events having been
achieved and (ii) the first JandJ Calendar Quarter following the first JandJ
Calendar Year during which Net Sales of all Company Products decreased by
thirty percent (30%) or more as compared to the immediately preceding JandJ
Calendar Year, provided in the case of subclause (ii) that the Purchaser does
not then have an IND pending with the FDA for a Company Product, following
Regulatory Approval of the first Company Product, Purchaser will provide the
Holder Representative with a written report within ninety (90) days after the
conclusion of each JandJ Calendar Year setting forth in reasonable detail the
analysis and computation of the Net Sales of the Company Products during the
preceding JandJ Calendar Year (the "Net Sales Report"). If the Purchaser
determines that a Commercial Milestone Event has been achieved during any JandJ
Calendar Year, within thirty (30) days following the end of such JandJ Calendar
Year, the Purchaser shall provide notice to the Holder Representative that
such Commercial Milestone Event, as applicable, has been achieved. If after
delivery of such Net Sales Report, the Holder Representative requests in
writing a meeting with representatives of the Purchaser to discuss such
report, the Purchaser shall make available in person or by phone (at the
Holder Representative's option and cost (on behalf of the Participating
Holders) if applicable) for such a meeting an appropriate senior management
employee of Purchaser or an Affiliate (who has knowledge sufficient to discuss
such Net Sales Report in reasonable detail) as determined by the Purchaser in
its reasonable discretion. The Purchaser shall keep (and shall cause its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation to keep), for so long as
required under Purchaser's internal records retention policies, books and
records pertaining to the Net Sales of the Company Product with respect to
each JandJ Calendar Year.

(ii) The Holder Representative may engage the Neutral Auditor to conduct an
audit of the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) for the purposes of confirming whether a Commercial Milestone
Payment has been achieved for the prior JandJ Calendar Year and the Purchaser's
compliance with the Commercial Milestone Payments provisions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the other provisions of this Section 4.7(c).

(iii) The Purchaser shall afford the Neutral Auditor reasonable access to and
an opportunity to examine such books and records of the Purchaser as it
reasonably requests,

 during regular business hours, in a manner designed to avoid disruption to the
Purchaser's business and subject to execution and delivery to Purchaser of a
confidentiality agreement substantially similar to the terms set forth in
Section 10.13 hereof for the sole purpose of determining compliance with the
Commercial Milestone Payments provisions of this Agreement; provided that such
access need not be provided earlier than forty-five (45) days following the
Holder Representative's request of an audit pursuant to this Section 4.7(c).

(iv) Each of the Holder Representative and the Purchaser will be entitled to
receive (substantially simultaneously) a full written report of the Neutral
Auditor with respect to its findings directly from the Neutral Auditor.

(v) The Holder Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders) will
bear the full cost of such audit, unless such audit discloses that a
Commercial Milestone Event was achieved but not reported by the Purchaser, in
which case, the Purchaser shall bear the cost of the Neutral Auditor for such
audit not to exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).

(vi) Within ninety (90) days after the delivery by the Purchaser of written
notice (or, if applicable, the delivery by the Neutral Auditor of an audit
report containing a final determination of the Neutral Auditor), that any
Commercial Milestone Event has been achieved, the Purchaser will pay to the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for further
distribution to the Participating Holders (pro rata in accordance with their
respective Participating Holder Percentages) the applicable Commercial
Milestone Payment. Each such payment will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Paying Agent for further disbursement to
the Participating Holders, or, in the case of holders of Company Options that
are outstanding at the Effective Time, to the Surviving Corporation for
further distribution directly to the holders of such Company Options or, if
applicable, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system.

(vii) In the event of any dispute between the Holder Representative and
Purchaser regarding the findings of an audit under this Section 4.7(c), the
Parties will initially attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute amicably
between themselves, and if the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days after delivery to both Parties of the Neutral
Auditor's report, Purchaser will select, subject to the Holder
Representative's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, an internationally recognized independent certified public accounting
firm (other than the Neutral Auditor) to resolve such dispute in accordance
with such procedures as such independent accounting firm may determine, and
such accounting firm's determination will be binding on both Parties absent
manifest error by such accounting firm. The Purchaser will bear the full cost
of such audit, unless such audit discloses that a Commercial Milestone Event
previously determined by the Neutral Auditor to be achieved is determined by
such audit to have not been achieved, in which case, the Holder Representative
(on behalf of the Participating Holders) shall be responsible for the costs
and expenses of such audit, not to exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000).

(viii) The Holder Representative's exercise of its audit rights under this
Section 4.7 may not (A) be conducted with respect to any JandJ Calendar Year
more than three (3) years after the end of such JandJ Calendar Year, (B) be
conducted more than once in any twelve (12)

 month period (unless a previous audit during such twelve (12) month period
revealed a material underpayment with respect to such period), or (C) be
repeated for any JandJ Calendar Year.

(i) In the event that the Purchaser does not pay a Milestone Payment within
the period required for such payment, interest at the Applicable Interest Rate
shall accrue and be paid on each Milestone Payment from and after the date
Purchaser is required to pay such Milestone Payment to the Participating
Holders pursuant to Section 4.7(b)(ii) or Section 4.7(c)(vi), as applicable,
until the date that such Milestone Payment is paid in full. In addition to the
interest paid pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, a portion of
each Milestone Payment shall be reported on Tax Returns as imputed interest to
the extent required by Tax Law.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that, following the Closing, it is the intention
of the Parties that the development, marketing, commercial exploitation and
sale of the Company Products shall be exercised by Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates and transferees in accordance with its or
their own business judgment and in its or their sole and absolute discretion.
Following the Closing, by execution of this Agreement, in exchange for the
consideration set forth herein, the Participating Holders and their Affiliates
and the Holder Representative acknowledge, understand and agree as follows:

(i) Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates and transferees
shall have complete control and sole discretion with respect to the
development, commercial exploitation, marketing and sale of Company Products,
and that this will have a material effect upon the Net Sales of the Company
Products, the achievability of the Milestones and the payment of the Milestone
Payments that may be payable hereunder and such control and discretion by
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates could result in some
or all of the Milestone Payments not being made. The Parties acknowledge that
the achievement of the Milestones is uncertain and that the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates may not achieve results requiring
the payment of any Milestone Payment at all, and it is therefore not assured
that Purchaser will be required to pay any Milestone Payments.

(ii) Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates and transferees
have no duty to develop, market, commercially exploit or sell any Company
Product, to exert any level of efforts in marketing, commercially exploiting
or sale of any Company Product or to achieve the Milestones;

(iii) that whether or not Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates or transferees develop, market, commercially exploit or make any
sales of any Company Product, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates and transferees are not prohibited from developing, manufacturing,
marketing, selling, or acquiring assets or businesses related to other
products that may compete with a Company Product or reduce the Net Sales;

(iv) that personnel of Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates and transferees are only required to take actions in connection
with the development, marketing, commercial exploitation and sale of any
Company Product that such personnel believe to be in the best interests of
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates and transferees and
that they are not required to take into account the interests of the
Participating Holders;

 (v) neither Purchaser, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates or
Representatives has furnished or provided, whether written or oral, any
assurances or commitments regarding the achievability of the condition to the
payment of any of the Milestone Payments set forth in this Section 4.7 or the
likelihood thereof, and each Participating Holder expressly disclaims any
rights with respect to any such assurances or commitments; and

(vi) not to challenge in any subsequent claim or action any decision regarding
the development, marketing, commercial exploitation or sale of any Company
Product made by any director, officer, employee or agent of Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates or transferees in what such
individual subjectively believes to be the best interests of Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates and transferees.

(e) Before signing this Agreement the Parties (other than the Holder
Representative) and certain Participating Holders have had numerous
conversations and have generated correspondence and other writings, in which
such parties discussed the transaction which is the subject of this Agreement
and their aspirations for success. In such conversations and writings, such
Parties and individuals representing them may have expressed their judgments
and beliefs concerning the intentions, capabilities, and practices of the
Parties, and may have forecasted future events. The Parties recognize that
such conversations and writings often involve an effort by both sides to be
positive and optimistic about the prospects for the transaction. However, each
Party acknowledges that all business transactions contain an element of risk,
as do the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that it is normal
business practice to limit the legal obligations of contracting parties to
only those promises and representations which are essential to their
transaction so as to provide certainty as to their respective future rights
and remedies. Accordingly, other than the Ancillary Agreements entered into
between the Parties, this Agreement is intended to define the full extent of
the legally enforceable undertakings of the parties hereto, and no promise or
representation, written or oral, which is not set forth explicitly in this
Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement is intended by any Party to be legally
binding. Each of the Parties acknowledge that in deciding to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger none of them has relied upon any
statements or representations, written or oral, other than those explicitly
set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any obligations
assumed by Purchaser pursuant to or arising from the NYU Amendment (or the
underlying agreement in connection therewith) shall have no effect on the
provisions of this Section 4.7, and nothing herein, expressed or implied,
shall give or be construed to give the Participating Holders or any of their
Affiliates any rights as a third party beneficiary of the NYU Amendment (or
the underlying agreement in connection therewith) after the Closing; provided,
however, that the foregoing is not intended to limit or abrogate any rights
granted under the NYU License to the parties thereto.

(f) After the Closing, no Participating Holder may sell, exchange, transfer or
otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion of any
Milestone Payment that becomes due and payable in accordance with this Section
4.7, other than (i) upon death by will or intestacy; (ii) by instrument to an
inter vivos or testamentary trust in which the right to receive the Milestone
Payment or portion thereof is to be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of
the trustee; (iii) made pursuant to a court order; (iv) made by operation of
law (including a consolidation or merger) or without consideration in
connection with the dissolution, liquidation or termination of

 any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity; (v)
to any other Participating Holder; (vi) in the case of any Participating
Holder that is a partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trustee
or similar entity, (x) to one or more partners, shareholders, members,
beneficiaries or similar owners of or investors in such Participating Holder
or (y) a successor entity upon the sale of substantially all of the assets of
such Participating Holder; or (vii) to any Person, with Purchaser's consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Any
transfer in violation of this Section 4.7(f) shall be null and void and shall
not be recognized by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation.

(g) Rights Transfer Event. In connection with a Rights Transfer Event,
Purchaser may, with the prior written consent of the Holder Representative
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), amend the
definition of "Net Sales" and other provisions of this Agreement in a manner
that is not adverse to the Participating Holders to align such provisions with
corresponding concepts set forth in the definitive documentation for such
Rights Transfer Event, in furtherance of harmonizing provisions of this
Agreement with the definitive agreement effecting such Rights Transfer Event.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, to the extent a
Rights Transfer Event does not occur in connection with a sale of all or
substantially all of the oncology assets, or exclusive license of the
oncology-related Intellectual Property, of the Purchaser, Purchaser shall
cause the acquirer in such Rights Transfer Event to assume Purchaser's
obligations under this Section 4.7 in a writing enforceable by the Holder
Representative. Upon any such assumption, the Purchaser shall be relieved and
discharged from any obligations hereunder to the extent so assumed.

Article V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to the Purchaser that, except as set forth
in the Disclosure Letter, the following statements are true and correct as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date:

5.1. Corporate Organization and Standing; Subsidiaries. The Company is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

the Purchaser complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Company. The Company is duly qualified, licensed or
registered to do business in each of the jurisdictions set forth in Schedule
5.1 hereto, which are the only jurisdictions in which the nature of the
business being presently conducted by it or its Assets and Properties makes
such qualification, licensing or registration necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other business
association or entity. The Company has no Subsidiaries.

5.2. Capitalization of the Company.

 (a) Schedule 5.2(a) hereto sets forth as of the date of this Agreement, (a)
the number of Shares of each class or series of authorized capital stock of
the Company, (b) the name of each record owner of Shares and the number and
class or series of Shares owned of record by each such Stockholder and (c)
with respect to any outstanding Company Options (whether vested or unvested as

Options, (ii) the number of Shares and class or series of Shares subject to
each such Company Option, (iii) the exercise price thereof, and (iv) the tax-

issued in violation of any preemptive rights, and are owned as of the date of
this Agreement by the record holder thereof listed on Schedule 5.2(a) hereto,
free and clear of all Liens other than (a) restrictions on transfer under
federal and state securities laws, (b) Liens that will be released prior to
the Closing or (c) Liens created or approved by the Purchaser in writing.
Except for the Shares listed as issued and outstanding on Schedule 5.2(a)
hereto, no Shares of capital stock of the Company are issued, outstanding or
reserved for issuance other than Shares of Company Common Stock issued upon
exercise of Company Options after the date of this Agreement. Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.2(a) hereto, there are no preemptive, first refusal or
similar rights on the part of any holder of any Shares or other securities of
the Company, or obligating the Company to issue or sell any Shares, or other
equity interests in the Company. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.2(a) hereto
or for Company Options issued in compliance with Section 7.9, no options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, warrants, subscriptions, conversion,
exchange or other rights, agreements or commitments of any kind obligating the
Company, contingently or otherwise, to issue or sell any Shares or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for any such Shares, or any other
equity or voting interest in the Company, are outstanding, and no
authorization therefor has been given. There are no outstanding or authorized
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, profit participation or similar
rights with respect to the Shares, or other equity or voting interest in, the
Company. There are no Contracts, arrangements or agreements to which the
Company is a party or by which it is bound, to (i) repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Shares, or other equity or voting interest in, the
Company or any other Person or (ii) vote or dispose of any Shares, or other
equity or voting interest in, the Company. The Company has not redeemed any of
its shares of capital stock within the past twelve (12) months. Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.2(a) hereto, there are no irrevocable proxies and no
voting agreements with respect to any Shares, or other equity or voting
interest in, the Company.

(b) The Allocation Schedule is true, correct and complete and sets forth
payments with respect to which the amount to be received by the holders of the
Shares and Company Options is consistent with this Agreement and is consistent
with the Company's Organizational Documents.

5.3. Power and Authorization.

(a) The Company has full right, power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to perform fully its obligations hereunder, subject to receipt
of the Stockholder Approval in the case of the consummation of the Merger.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is the
valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as enforcement may be limited by equitable
principles limiting

 the right to obtain specific performance or other equitable remedies, or by
applicable bankruptcy or insolvency Laws and related decisions affecting
creditors' rights generally.

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held,
or by written consent in lieu of such meeting, duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions as of the date of this Agreement (i) approving this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) determining that
the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and the Stockholders, (iii)
recommending that the Stockholders adopt this Agreement and (iv) declaring
that this Agreement is advisable. Such resolutions are sufficient as of the
date hereof to render inapplicable to the Purchaser and Merger Sub and this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. No other state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to the Company with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby.

(c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of Shares necessary to
approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding (i) Shares of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock, voting as a single class (on an as-converted
basis) and (ii) Shares of Company Preferred Stock (the "Stockholder
Approval"). The adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholders by written
consent is permissible under Section 228 of the DGCL and the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws.

5.4. No Conflict. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
other instruments and agreements contemplated hereby, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) conflict with or result in a
default under or violation of, or result in the acceleration of any obligation
under, or the creation in any Person of any right to accelerate, terminate,
modify or cancel, any Material Contract, (ii) conflict with or result in a
breach of or constitute a default under any provision of the Organizational
Documents of the Company, (iii) result in the creation of any Lien that is not
a Permitted Lien upon any of its Assets and Properties, or (iv) assuming the
making of all notifications or filings as may be required under the Antitrust
Laws in connection with the transactions described in this Agreement and the
receipt of all Antitrust Consents, violate any Laws to which the Company is
subject or by which the Company or any of its Assets and Properties is bound,
except, in the case of (i), (iii) and (iv) where such conflicts, defaults,
violations, accelerations, terminations, modifications, cancellations or Liens
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company.

5.5. Financial Information. Attached hereto as Schedule 5.5 are (i) the
unaudited balance sheets of the Company at December 31, 2017 and December 31,
2016 and the related unaudited statements of income, cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December
31, 2016, (collectively, the "Financial Statements") and (ii) the unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as at March 31, 2018 (the "Company Balance
Sheet"), together with the related unaudited statement of income for the three
(3) months ended March 31, 2018 (collectively, the "Interim Financial
Statements"). The Financial Statements and the Interim Financial Statements
except as described therein or in Schedule 5.5, have been prepared from the
books and records of the Company and are in accordance with the books and
records of the Company

 and with GAAP, consistently followed throughout the periods indicated (subject
in the case of the Interim Financial Statements to normal year-end audit
adjustments, the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be materially adverse, and the absence of footnote disclosure). The Financial
Statements and Interim Financial Statements fairly present, in all material
respects, the financial position of the Company at the respective dates
thereof, and the statements of income and cash flows included in the Financial
Statements and Interim Financial Statements fairly present, in all material
respects, the results of the operations and cash flows of the Company for the
periods covered thereby. The Company has devised and maintained systems of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(i) all transactions are executed in accordance with Company management's
general or specific authorization and (ii) all transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP and to maintain proper accountability for items.

5.6. Insurance. Schedule 5.6 hereto sets forth a complete and correct list and
description of the policies of insurance in effect on the date of this
Agreement covering the Assets and Properties and operations of the Company.

Business) are valid and subsisting and in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, all premiums thereon have been paid, and the Company is
otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the terms and provisions
of such policies. The Company is not in default under any of such insurance
policies. The Company has not received notice of cancellation of any such
policy as of the date of this Agreement.

to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company (or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the Stockholders, directors, officers, agents or
employees of the Company, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding,
arbitration or investigation relates to the Company) or any Assets and
Properties of the Company, and there are no Governmental Orders currently in
force against the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Stockholders, directors, officers, agents or employees of the Company,
relating to or affecting the Company or any of its Assets and Properties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for all purposes of the Agreement, the Company
does not make any representation or warranty (pursuant to this Section 5.7 or
elsewhere in the Agreement) regarding the effect of the applicable Antitrust
Laws on its ability to execute, deliver, or perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions described in this Agreement as a
result of the enactment, promulgation, application, or threatened or actual
judicial or administrative investigation or litigation under, or enforcement
of, any Antitrust Law with respect to the consummation of the transactions
described in this Agreement.

Knowledge of the Company, the Company is not in violation of or in
noncompliance in any material respect with any material covenant, condition,
restriction, order or easement affecting the Leased Real Property. There is no

or accrued in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and
any applicable accounting requirements.

 (d) Each Plan has been, in all material respects, established, maintained and
administered in accordance with its terms and with all provisions of ERISA,
the Code and other applicable Law. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect
to a Plan has engaged in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the

to the administration or investment of the assets of any Plan.

(or, if such plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan document, such
prototype or volume submitter plan document has received a favorable opinion
from the IRS that the form meets the Tax qualification requirements and the
Company is entitled to rely on such favorable opinion) to the effect that such
Plan satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that its
related trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances that
could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or the
imposition of material liability, penalty or Tax under ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Law. No actions, investigations, suits or claims with respect
to any Plan are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, and
to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts that reasonably would be
expected to give rise to any such actions, suits or claims against any Plan,
any fiduciary with respect to a Plan or the assets of a Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).

(f) No Plan provides post-employment medical, life insurance or other welfare
benefits to any of the Company's current employees or former employees,
officers, or directors, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, except to the

plan that is or was, subject to Title IV of ERISA or a "multiemployer plan"
(as defined in Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Plan is a (i)
"multiple employer plan" (as defined in 29 C.F.R. Section 4001.2) or a plan

any liability for Taxes under Sections 4975 through 4980 or Sections 4980A
through 4980I of the Code. The Company maintains a health plan that satisfies
the requirements for "minimum essential coverage" under Section 4980H(a) of
the Code (as applicable to "applicable large employers" within the meaning of
Section 4980H(a) of the Code, without regard to whether the Company is an

 "applicable large employer"), which minimum essential coverage satisfies an
affordability safe harbor under Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980H-5 and
provides "minimum value" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980H-1(a)(28), and the Company has offered such minimum essential coverage
to all "full-time employees" (within the meaning of Section 4980H of the Code)
and their dependents.

(j) Except as set forth in Schedule 5.17(j) hereto, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (alone or in combination with another event) (i)
result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount of any compensation
due, to any current or former employee of the Company, (ii) increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such compensation or benefits, (iv)
result in the triggering of any restrictions or limitations on the right of
the Company to amend or terminate any Plan or (v) entitle the recipient of any
payment or benefit to receive a "gross up" payment for any Taxes, including as
a result of Sections 280G, 409A, or 4999 of the Code.

structures) currently owned or operated by the Company or any property

other material environmental information prepared in the past five (5) years,
in the possession of the Company relating to the Company or any real property
currently or formerly owned or operated in connection with the business of the
Company have been made available to the Purchaser. Since January 1, 2015, or
earlier where the underlying matters have not been resolved, the Company has

Article VII

COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

7.1. Continuing Employees.

(a) Employee Benefits. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less
than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, to each employee of the
Company as of immediately prior to the Closing (together, the "Continuing
Employees"), base salary or wage rates, bonus opportunities, and other
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
either, at Purchaser's election, (i) the base salary or wage rates, bonus
opportunities, and other employee benefits (excluding any equity-based
compensation, defined benefit pensions, post-employment welfare benefits, or
payments or benefits payable on account of a change in control, in each case,
provided by the Company) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing, or (ii) the base salary or wage rates, bonus
opportunities, and other employee benefits provided to similarly situated new
hires (but subject to Section 7.1(b)) of the Purchaser and its Affiliates.

(b) Crediting of Service. Subject to applicable Law, the Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to, recognize the
prior service with the Company and its Affiliates, including prior service
with predecessor employers where such prior service is recognized by the
Company as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, (i) for purposes of
vesting (but not eligibility or benefit accrual) under Purchaser's defined
benefit pension plan, (ii) for

 purposes of eligibility and benefit accrual for vacation under Purchaser's
vacation program, (iii) for purposes of eligibility to participate in any
health or welfare plan maintained by Purchaser (other than any post-employment
health or post-employment welfare plan) and Purchaser's 401(k) plan, and (iv)
unless covered under another arrangement of the Company, for benefit
computation purposes under Purchaser's severance plan (in the case of each of
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), solely to the extent that (A) such periods
of employment are taken into account under analogous Plans before the Closing
and (B) Purchaser makes such plan or program available to employees of the
Company, and not in any case where credit would result in duplication of
benefits).

(c) Pre-Existing Conditions. With respect to any welfare plan maintained by
Purchaser in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates following the Closing to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the welfare Plans prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing, for the current calendar year, in satisfying any analogous deductible
or out of pocket requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.
For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not be required to take any action
to the extent Purchaser determines that such action (a) could make a
Continuing Employee (or eligible dependent) ineligible for a benefit (for
example, if credit for past contributions would make the Continuing Employee
ineligible for health savings account contributions from Purchaser) or (b)
would violate any Law to which Purchaser or its Affiliates is subject.

(d) No Third Party Beneficiary. Nothing contained in this Section 7.1, or
elsewhere in this Agreement, shall confer upon any employee or other service
provider to the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries, or any legal representative or beneficiary of any of them, any
rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or level of compensation or benefits, nor shall anything in
this Agreement constitute the establishment, adoption, modification, amendment
or termination of any Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program,
policy, arrangement or agreement.

7.2. Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions
contained herein, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and other
than with respect to the Antitrust Consents which are governed by Section
7.10, (a) the Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with each other and
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to make, or cause to be made, all filings necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws, to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date, all
consents, agreements, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of
Governmental Entities and other Persons, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser, as are necessary for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Purchaser shall provide commercially
reasonable cooperation to the Company in connection therewith. The Company
shall, promptly following the date hereof, deliver a draft of all consents and
agreements required to be

 delivered pursuant to Sections 3.2(e) and 3.2(o) to Purchaser for review and
the Company shall reflect any reasonable comments thereon provided by
Purchaser. Upon a written request by Purchaser, the Company and each
Stockholder that executes a counterpart signature page hereto shall exercise,
or cause to be exercised, all "drag-along rights" available to it under the
Company ROFR Agreement and use reasonable efforts to promptly comply with all
obligations therein.

7.3. Disclosures. None of the Company, any Participating Holder or any of
their Affiliates, the Purchaser or Merger Sub, without the prior written
consent of the other, will make any press release or any similar public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that (i) any Party or any of its Affiliates may
make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable
Law (including in connection with making any notifications that may be
required under Antitrust Laws or responding to any requests for information or
documents made by a Governmental Entity investigating the transactions
described herein) or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which
any Affiliate of the Company list securities or is subject and in such case
such Party must, prior to making such disclosure, (x) use commercially
reasonable efforts to advise the other Party of such disclosure (including a
copy thereof) as far in advance of such disclosure as is reasonably
practicable (which for the avoidance of doubt shall be at least three (3)
Business Days prior to such expected disclosure) and (y) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, consult with the other Party with respect to the
content of such disclosure and reflect any reasonable comments thereon
provided by the other Party and (ii) following the initial press release or
similar public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Parties may make additional press releases or similar
public announcements to the extent such press release and similar public
announcements are consistent with the initial press release or similar public
announcement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, no
Party shall make any public disclosure prior to the time that the Company
delivers the Written Consent to the Purchaser.

7.4. The Purchaser's Access and Inspection.

(a) To the extent consistent with applicable Laws, the Company shall provide
the Purchaser and its representatives, upon reasonable advance notice by the
Purchaser, reasonable access during normal business hours, from and after the
date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, to the Company, the books and
records of the Company and senior management, officers, directors, accountants
and advisors of the Company, for the purpose of making such investigation as
the Purchaser may reasonably desire, and the Company shall furnish the
Purchaser such information concerning its business, facilities, and Leased
Real Property, as the Purchaser may reasonably request. The Company shall
reasonably assist the Purchaser in making such investigation to the extent and
at such times as the Purchaser and its Representatives may reasonably request.
Any and all such inspections, access for investigations and assistance shall
be conducted in accordance with applicable Law (including any applicable
competition, antitrust or trade regulation Law) during normal business hours
and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
such access or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it involves
access that or would require the Company to disclose information if such
disclosure (a) includes information subject to attorney-client

 privilege or attorney work product privilege, (b) would conflict with any
third party confidentiality obligations to which the Company is bound, (c)
would violate any applicable Law or (d) includes personnel records of the
Company relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information that in the Company's good-faith opinion is
sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject the Company to risk of
Losses.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, until such time as the first Company
Product obtains Regulatory Approval in the United States, the Holder
Representative may request, not more than one (1) time per JandJ Calendar Year,
that the Purchaser arrange a telephonic conference to provide a summary update
on its development activities in connection with the Company Products.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access or examination
shall be permitted to the extent that it would require the Purchaser to
disclose information if such disclosure (a) involves information subject to
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege and such
disclosure would adversely affect such privilege, (b) would breach any third
party confidentiality obligations to which the Purchaser is bound, or (c)
would violate any applicable Law; provided, that in each of the foregoing
situations, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
such information to the Holder Representative in a manner that would not
adversely affect such privilege, breach such confidentiality obligation or
violate applicable Law, as applicable.

(c) On the date of this Agreement, that certain Confidential Disclosure
Agreement, dated as of April 21, 2017 between the Company and Johnson and
Johnson Innovation LLC (an Affiliate of the Purchaser) (the "Confidentiality
Agreement") shall terminate and the terms of Section 10.13 hereof shall
control with respect to Confidential Information; provided, however, that in
the event of termination of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed to resume in force pursuant to its
terms as if not terminated.

7.5. Tax Matters.

(a) Taxes Through Closing Date. Except to the extent (x) already paid on or
before the Closing Date or (y) included as a liability in the calculation of
the Final Closing Liability Amount and reflected in the reserve for Tax
liability shown on the Closing Balance Sheet as finally determined pursuant to
Section 4.3, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the Participating Holders agrees to severally (according to
such Participating Holder's Indemnification Pro Rata Percentage), and not
jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons against Losses arising out of or resulting from (without
duplication) (i) all Taxes of the Company for all taxable periods (or portions
thereof) that end on or before the Closing Date, including the pre-Closing
portion of any Straddle Periods (as determined pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(ii))
(each, a "Pre-Closing Period"); (ii) Transfer Taxes borne by the Participating
Holders pursuant to Section 4.4; (iii) all Taxes arising as a result of a
breach (A) of any representation or warranty in this Agreement relating to
Taxes or (B) of any covenant in this Agreement relating to Taxes; and (iv) all
Taxes imposed on the Company as a result of the provisions of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or the analogous provisions of any state, local
or foreign Law.

 (b) Preparation of Tax Returns.

(i) The Holder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared, (at the
expense of the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Participating Holders))
in a manner that is consistent with the past practice of the Company, and the
Purchaser shall subsequently file or cause to be filed, all income Tax Returns
for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that
are filed after the Closing Date; provided that the Purchaser shall be
reimbursed by the Holder Representative from the Representative Reimbursement
Set-Aside (on behalf of the Participating Holders) the Tax shown as due
thereon prior to the filing of any such Tax Return. The Holder Representative
shall deliver such Tax Returns to the Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior
to the due date for the Purchaser's review and the Holder Representative shall
consider in good faith any of the Purchaser's comments thereon. With respect
to any Tax Return that the Company prepares or causes to be prepared and files
or causes to be filed prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare
such Tax Returns in a manner that is consistent with the past practice of the
Company and pay the Tax shown as due thereon. The Company shall deliver such
Tax Returns to the Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior to the due date for
the Purchaser's review and the Company shall consider in good faith any of the
Purchaser's comments thereon. In connection with the foregoing income Tax
Returns for which the Holder Representative is responsible and to the extent
reasonably necessary, Purchaser will (and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to) consent to the Holder Representative's use of the Company's existing tax
return preparation firm(s); provided that the cost of any such engagement will
be borne by the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Participating
Holders).

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.5(b)(i), the Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax
Returns of the Company that are filed after the Closing Date (each, a "Post-
Closing Tax Return"). All Taxes of the Company that relate to any taxable year
or period that includes but does not end on the Closing Date (the "Straddle
Period") shall be apportioned between the Participating Holders and the
Purchaser as follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes of the Company not based
upon or measured by income, activities, events, payments, the level of any
item, gain, receipts, proceeds, profits or other similar items for Tax periods
(or the portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date will be deemed
to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period, and (ii) the determination of any other Taxes for the
portion of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period
beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the
Company had a taxable year or period which ended at the close of business on
the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances, deductions or any other
items that are calculated on an annual or periodic basis, shall be prorated on
the basis of the number of days in the annual period elapsed through the
Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the annual period elapsing
after the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall deliver any Tax Returns that
relate to a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or a Straddle
Period to the Holder Representative at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the due date for the Holder Representative's review and the Purchaser shall
consider in good faith any of the Holder Representative's comments thereon
that may affect the amount of Taxes for which the Participating Holders are or
may be responsible pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.5(a).

 (iii) The Participating Holders shall pay the Purchaser (A) the amount of any
Taxes due with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Return filed pursuant to Section
7.5(b)(ii) for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date and (B) the
amount of any Taxes due with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Return filed
pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(ii) for any Straddle Period to the extent that such
Taxes for a Straddle Period are allocated to the Participating Holders
pursuant to Section 7.5(b)(ii) (except in each case to the extent such Taxes
have been (x) already paid on or before the Closing Date or (y) included as a
liability in the calculation of the Final Closing Liability Amount and
reflected in the reserve for Tax liability shown on the Closing Balance Sheet
as finally determined pursuant to Section 4.3) in accordance with the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article VIII.

(c) Cooperation and Assistance. The Purchaser and the Holder Representative
shall provide each other with such cooperation and assistance as may be
reasonably requested by either of them in connection with the preparation of
any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority, or any
judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes and
each will provide the other with any records or information which may be
relevant to such Tax Return, audit, or examination, proceedings or
determination. Such cooperation and assistance shall include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis during normal business hours to
provide additional information. The Party requesting assistance hereunder
shall reimburse the other for reasonable expense incurred in providing such
assistance.

(d) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all Tax sharing agreements or practices to
which the Company is a party or otherwise subject shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and no payments relating thereto shall be made subsequent to
the Closing Date.

(e) Tax Certificates.

(i) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the
Purchaser a duly executed certification by the Company that meets the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(1)(i), dated within
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser along with written authorization for
the Purchaser to deliver such notice form to the IRS on behalf of the Company
upon Closing. If the Purchaser does not receive the certification as described
above on or prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be permitted to
withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement any required
withholding Tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

(ii) On or prior to the Closing Date, each Stockholder and each independent
contractor that is a holder of Company Options shall deliver to the relevant
payor and the Purchaser a properly completed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS
Form W-8 in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such payor and
Purchaser. If the relevant payor and Purchaser do not receive the applicable
IRS Form from a Participating Holder on or prior to the Closing Date, such
payor and Purchaser shall be permitted to withhold from the payments to be
made to such Participating Holder pursuant to this Agreement any required
withholding Tax under the Code.

(iii) Tax Information. On or before the Effective Time, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser a schedule that sets forth the names and addresses of
each Participating Holder and the amount of money and fair market value of
property transferred to each such

 Participating Holder and other information required to be provided under
Section 6043A of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(f) Tax Claims.

(1) After the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company) shall promptly notify the Holder Representative in writing upon
receipt of any written notice of any pending or threatened audit or
assessment, suit, proposed adjustment, deficiency, dispute, administrative or
judicial proceeding or similar claim relating to Taxes for which the Purchaser
would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.5(a) (a "Tax
Claim"); provided, however, that a failure by the Purchaser to give such
notice shall not affect the Purchaser's right to indemnification under this
Agreement except to the extent that the Participating Holders are actually
prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.

(2) The Purchaser will control, without affecting its or any other Person's
rights to indemnification under this Agreement, the defense of all Tax Claims.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holder Representative can elect to control,
at the expense of the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Participating
Holders), the defense of any Tax Claim for which the Purchaser would be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.5(a); provided that (i) the
Holder Representative shall conduct the defense of any such Tax Claim
diligently and in good faith, (ii) the Purchaser shall have the right to
participate in a non-controlling manner and at its own expense in such defense
and (iii) the Holder Representative shall not settle or compromise any such
Tax Claim without the Purchaser's consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(g) Inconsistencies with the Rest of this Agreement. If there is any
inconsistency between a provision of this Section 7.5 and a provision of the
remainder of this Agreement with respect to Tax matters, the provisions of
this Section 7.5 shall prevail.

(h) Refunds. The Participating Holders shall be entitled to the amount of any
refund or credit of Taxes of the Company (including any interest paid or
credited with respect to such refund or credit but less the Tax and other
reasonable out-of-pocket costs related to receipt by the Company of such
refund or credit or such interest)with respect to a Pre-Closing Period (to the
extent such Taxes were paid by the Company prior to the Closing or by the
Participating Holders after the Closing) which refund or credit is actually
received (including as a credit against other Tax liabilities) by the
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company) after the Closing, except
to the extent that such refund or credit is attributable to the carryback of a
Tax attribute from a Post-Closing Period (including a net operating loss, net
capital loss, foreign tax credit or research and development credit). The
Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Participating Holders any
amount to which the Participating Holders are entitled pursuant to the prior
sentence within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt or recognition of the
applicable refund or credit by the Purchaser or its Affiliates. To the extent
requested by the Holder Representative, the Purchaser will reasonably
cooperate with the Holder Representative and the Participating Holders in
obtaining such refund

 or credit, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns for periods
ending before or on the Closing Date or refund claims.

(i) Post-Closing Actions. Except as otherwise required by Law or with the
written consent of the Holder Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Purchaser shall not amend
any Tax Return of the Company for any Pre-Closing Period or make any Tax
election that would reasonably be expected to result in any increased Tax
liability for the Participating Holders or to increase the amount the
Purchaser would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to Section 7.5(a).

(i) Tax Treatment of Milestone Payments. For Tax purposes, the Parties agree
that any payments of a portion of any Milestone Payment with respect to
Company Options will be reported on Tax Returns as being subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) until such amounts become due and payable hereunder.

7.6. Notification of Certain Matters. Until the Closing, the Company and the
Purchaser shall give prompt notice to each other of any of the following which
occurs, or of which it becomes aware, following the date of this Agreement:
any fact, circumstance or event that will or is reasonably expected to result
in any of the conditions set forth in Article III becoming incapable of being
satisfied; provided that neither the Company nor the Purchaser shall be liable
for errors in the information the Company provides to the Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 7.6, except to the extent based upon fraud by the Company.

7.7. Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this Agreement to
the earlier of (a) the Closing Date and (b) the date this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company and each Stockholder
shall not take, and shall cause its Affiliates, stockholders, officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, consultants, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants and other agents to refrain from taking, any
action to, directly or indirectly, encourage, initiate, solicit or engage in
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person,
other than the Purchaser (and its Affiliates and representatives), concerning
any purchase of any capital stock of the Company (other than in connection
with the exercise of any Company Options outstanding on the date hereof) or
any merger, asset sale, license of material assets owned by or exclusively
licensed to, and used or held for use by, the Company to a third party,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Assets and Property. The Company shall, and shall direct its representatives
and Affiliates to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with
respect to any transaction described in the preceding sentence and (B)
promptly after the date hereof request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such Person(s) for the
purpose of evaluating such a possible transaction. The Company and each
Stockholder will notify the Purchaser as soon as practicable if any Person
makes any proposal, offer, inquiry to, or contact with, the Company or such
Stockholder with respect to the foregoing and shall describe in reasonable
detail the identity of any such Person and, the substance and material terms
of any such contact and the material terms of any such proposal.

 7.8. 280G Approvals. If required to avoid the imposition of Taxes under
Section 4999 of the Code or the loss of deduction under Section 280G of the
Code with respect to any payment or benefit in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each Person who has a right to
any payments and/or benefits that could reasonably be deemed to constitute
"parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) a
waiver, subject to the approval described in clause (ii), of such Person's
rights to such parachute payments (the "Waived 280G Benefits") so that all
remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such Person do not constitute
"excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code)
that would not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code and (ii) solicit
the approval by the Stockholders, to the extent and in a manner that complies
with, Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of any Waived 280G Benefits and any
"excess parachute payments" for which a waiver is not required. Prior to
seeking such waivers, and prior to soliciting such Stockholder approval, the
Company shall provide drafts of such waivers and such Stockholder approval
materials to Purchaser for its review no fewer than three (3) days prior to
seeking such approval and shall consider Purchaser's timely comments in good
faith. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser written
documentation that either (x) the approval by the Stockholders was solicited
in conformity with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, and the requisite
approval by the Stockholders was obtained, or (y) that the approval by the
Stockholders was not obtained and that, as a consequence, the Waived 280G
Benefits shall not be made or provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 7.8 shall not be breached by reason of any "excess parachute payments"
that occur (or could occur) due to any arrangements entered into by or at the
request of Purchaser, other than the Option Surrender Agreements and the
Consulting Agreement.

7.9. Conduct of Business Pending Closing.

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company shall conduct its business (including its working capital
and cash management practices) in a manner consistent in all material respects
with past practice of the Company except (i) as required by applicable Law,
(ii) to the extent deviation is required for the Company to comply with this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or (iii) as set forth on Schedule 7.9,
or (iv) for actions out of the Ordinary Course of Business for which the
Company receives the written consent of the Purchaser (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting the
foregoing and except as contemplated by this Agreement, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will:

applicable Law or as is expressly permitted, required by the Company's
obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or consented to
by the Purchaser in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company will not, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), take any of the following actions:

(1) subject any Assets or Properties to any Lien (other than any Permitted
Lien);

(2) enter into, materially amend, terminate or waive a material right under
any Material Contract;

(3) cancel or waive any claims or rights of material value, or sell, lease,
license, transfer, assign, distribute or otherwise dispose of any material
Assets or Properties;

(4) dispose of or allow the lapse of any rights in, to or for the use of any
Intellectual Property used by the Company in its business (other than inbound
non-exclusive "shrink wrap" or "clickwrap" software licenses for software that
is generally commercially available, and non-exclusive inbound licenses or
restricted use provisions that arise out of the purchase of off-the-shelf
reagents or other products from suppliers or through catalogs);

(5) (i) increase the compensation or benefits (including, but not limited to,
wages, salaries, bonuses or any other remuneration) payable to any director,
officer, employee or individual independent contractor of the Company, or (ii)
enter into, terminate or amend the terms of any employment, engagement,
compensation or incentive Contract with any such person or Plan, in each case
which would increase such individual's annual compensation and benefits by
more than five percent (5%) in the aggregate;

(6) make any capital expenditure or commitment for additions to property,
plant or equipment, or lease agreement, which individually exceeds Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000) or exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000)

material liability for nonperformance or termination of any Material Contract;

(1) eliminate any reserves established on the Company's books or change the
method of accrual unless there is any change of significant facts or
circumstances pertaining to any reserves which would justify their
elimination;

(2) incur any Indebtedness in excess of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars
($25,000);

(3) acquire any business or Person, by merger or consolidation, purchase of
substantial assets or equity interests, or by any other manner, in a single

inconsistent with the past practice of the Company;

(5) make, change or revoke any Tax election, make any change (or file for or
request any change) in any method of Tax accounting, file any amended Tax

 7.10. Certain Pre-Closing Activities.

(a) The Company and the Purchaser shall take all commercially reasonable steps
to promptly, but in any event on or before the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the date of this Agreement file or cause to be filed by its ultimate parent
entity as that term is defined in the HSR Act with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, pursuant
to the HSR Act, any required Notification and Report Forms (the "HSR Filing")
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act, and such Parties shall
furnish to each other such information and assistance as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of its HSR Filing. The
Purchaser and the Company shall take all commercially reasonable steps to: (a)
comply in a timely manner with any reasonable request under any Antitrust Laws
for additional information, documents, or other material received by the
Purchaser, the Company, or any of their Affiliates from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such filings, the Merger, or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; and (b) cooperate with each other in
connection with resolving any "Second Request" under the HSR Act or, any
similar request for additional information made by any other agency or
Governmental Entity under Antitrust Laws or any investigation or other inquiry
of any such agency or other Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Laws with
respect to any such filing, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Purchaser shall be entitled to coordinate all communications with
Governmental Entities regarding such Second Request or similar request, and
such Parties shall inform each other: (i) prior to delivering any material
communication to a Governmental Entity, (ii) promptly after receiving any
material communication from a Governmental Entity, and (iii) before entering
into any proposed understanding, undertaking, or agreement with any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filings, or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Neither the Purchaser nor the Company shall participate
in any substantive telephonic or in-person meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without
giving the other Party prior notice of the meeting to the extent practicable
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and participate; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude
a Party from participating in discussions with a Governmental Entity without
participation by the other Party where the subject matter in the reasonable
judgment of that Party cannot be effectively discussed in the presence of the
other Party (although in such case the other Party's outside counsel will be
permitted to attend so long as he or she agrees to keep the participating
Party's non-public information disclosed at such meeting on an outside counsel
only basis). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and
the Purchaser shall provide to each other (or the other's respective advisors)
upon request copies of all correspondence between such Party and any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Purchaser and the Company may, as they deem advisable and
necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the
other under this Section 7.10 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and
the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of
the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of
the Party providing such materials. In addition, subject to applicable Law,
the Company and the Purchaser will consult and cooperate with each other in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any

 Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by or on behalf of any Party.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, neither the Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates will be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation,
divestiture or other requirement that would (i) limit or otherwise adversely
affect the right of Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) to own or vote any
shares of equity interests in the Company, control the Company, or operate all
or any portion of the business of the Company or (ii) require or compel the
Company, Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser to dispose of all or any
portion of its properties or assets.

7.11. Stockholder Notice and Consents.

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days following the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare and send to all Stockholders who have not duly consented
in writing to, or voted in favor of the Merger, notice (the "Stockholder
Notice") of (i) the Stockholder Approval and (ii) applicable appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Stockholder Notice shall comply with
all applicable Laws and regulations, including the DGCL, and be accompanied by
all information required by the DGCL. The Company shall submit a draft of the
Stockholder Notice to the Purchaser for review and comment a reasonable period
of time (but no less than three (3) Business Days) prior to mailing and shall
incorporate therein any reasonable changes or comments that the Purchaser may
reasonably request.

7.12. Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary
thereof, the Purchaser shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill
and honor in all respects to the fullest extent available under applicable Law
the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification provisions
under the Organizational Documents of the Company as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and pursuant to any indemnity agreements between the Company
and each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of
the Company, as in effect on the date of this Agreement and made available by
the Company to Purchaser prior to the date hereof and (ii) cause the
Organizational Documents of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to
contain the same (or substantially similar) provisions with respect to
indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in the Company's
Organizational Documents on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any
manner that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Person who is
now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who
becomes prior to the Effective time, an officer or director of the Company
(the "DandO Indemnified Parties").

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain, and the costs and expenses
thereof shall be included as Transaction Expenses, prepaid "tail" or other
insurance policies with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance with respect to acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
coverage applicable to directors and officers as of the Effective Time under
the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time.

 (c) This Section 7.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Company, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the DandO Indemnified Parties, and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation.

If the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their assets
and Intellectual Property to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.12.

relating to:

deleted therefrom);

 (d) the breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, undertaking, agreement or
other obligation of such Participating Holder under such Participating
Holder's Letter of Transmittal or Option Surrender Agreement;

(e) (i) the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL by any
Stockholder or payment of any amounts to any Stockholder in excess of the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid to such Stockholder hereunder or
(ii) the payment of any amounts in respect of Company Options to any holder of
Company Options that neither exercised such holder's Company Options prior to

have received at Closing under an Option Surrender Agreement; or

(f) any claims under Section 7.5(a) for indemnification or in respect of
breaches of a covenant therein.

8.2. Indemnification by the Purchaser. Subject to the limits set forth in this
Article VIII, from and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each of the Participating Holders and each of their
respective stockholders, Affiliates, officers, controlling Persons, agents,
representatives, directors, employees, successors and assigns (such Persons
are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Participating Holder
Indemnified Persons"), from and against any and all Losses that such
Participating Holder Indemnified Persons may suffer, sustain, incur or become
subject to arising out of, caused by or directly or indirectly relating to:
(a) (i) any fraud by the Purchaser in connection with this Agreement or the

8.3. Survival of Representations and Warranties; Threshold and Deductible.

(a) The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than
the Fundamental Representations), or in any certificate or document delivered
pursuant hereto, and the right to indemnity pursuant to Section 8.1(a) in
connection therewith, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force
and effect thereafter for a period of fifteen (15) months after the Closing
Date (the "Expiration Date") and shall thereupon terminate and be of no
further force or effect;

(b) The representations and warranties contained in Section 5.9 (Tax Matters)
and any claims under Section 7.5(a) for indemnification or in respect of
breaches of a covenant therein, and the rights to indemnity pursuant to

therewith, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and

 effect until the date that is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
statute of limitations period applicable to the matters covered thereby;

(c) The Fundamental Representations (other than Section 5.9 (Tax Matters) and
the right to indemnity pursuant to Section 8.1(a) in connection therewith),
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until the date
that is seven (7) years following the Closing;

(d) All other claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 may be made
at any time until the date that is sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
statute of limitations period applicable to the matters covered thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement or any agreement delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the
Closing Date other than those which by their terms contemplate performance
after the Closing Date, which shall survive the Closing in accordance with
their terms; provided, however, that claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.1 in connection with breaches of such covenants or agreements to be
performed prior to or at the Closing may be made at any time after the Closing
until the Expiration Date.

(e) Each Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the respective
Indemnifying Party of any claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article
VIII or Section 7.5(a); provided, however, that failure to provide such notice
shall not affect such Indemnified Party's right to indemnification hereunder
unless and only to the extent the Indemnifying Party was actually prejudiced
by such failure to deliver notice. Any claim for indemnification made in
writing by the Indemnified Party on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period shall survive until such claim is finally and fully
resolved.

8.4. Limitation on Indemnification.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 8.4(c), no Purchaser Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to any recovery pursuant to Section 8.1(a) if:

(i) with respect to any individual claim under Section8.1(a), the amount of
Losses under such claim is less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the
"Individual Claim Threshold" and any such Loss that is disregarded pursuant to
this clause (i), a "Non-Qualified Loss"), after which, subject to clause (ii)
of this Section 8.4(a), the Purchaser Indemnified Person shall be indemnified
for the full amount of all Losses with respect to such claim and not only
those in excess of such Individual Claim Threshold; and

(ii) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses (including Non-Qualified
Losses) for which the Purchaser Indemnified Person is otherwise entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a) exceeds One Million Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($1,050,000) (the "Deductible") (at which point the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall be indemnified for only those Losses in excess of
the Deductible).

(b) At the time of recovery by a Purchaser Indemnified Person under any
indemnification claim under Section 8.1(a), except as set forth in Section
8.4(c), the maximum aggregate recovery by all Purchaser Indemnified Persons
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) shall not exceed

 an amount equal to twelve and one half percent (12.5%) of the aggregate
proceeds paid to the Participating Holders under this Agreement, at the time
of such recovery.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, but subject to
limitations on recovery set forth in Section 8.6, (i) the restrictions and
limitations set forth in Sections 8.4(a) and 8.4(b), shall not be applicable
to claims based upon fraud or arising under any breach of a Fundamental
Representation or under Section 7.5(a) for indemnification or in respect of
breaches of a covenant therein; provided, however, that in no event shall any
Participating Holder be liable hereunder for any amount in excess of such
Participating Holder's Indemnification Pro Rata Percentage of the proceeds
paid to the Participating Holders pursuant to this Agreement, other than
claims pursuant to Sections 8.1(c) or 8.1(d) with respect to such
Participating Holder, for which each Participating Holder's liability
hereunder shall not exceed the proceeds paid to such Participating Holder
pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) The amount of any and all Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.4 or this Article VIII shall be determined net of any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by such Indemnified
Person with respect to such Losses (less the reasonable costs of recovery
incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified Person in connection therewith).

(a) The Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
of its Losses (except for Losses relating to Taxes) that the Purchaser
Indemnified Persons may recover pursuant to this Article VIII solely to the
extent required by common law.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) no Losses shall
be recoverable under this Article VIII or otherwise under this Agreement that
constitute (x) punitive or special damages or (y) consequential or indirect
damages that are not the reasonably foreseeable result of the matter that gave
rise thereto or the matter for which indemnification is sought hereunder,
except, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), punitive,
special, consequential, or indirect damages owed to a Third Party in
connection with a Third Party Claim, and (ii) the amount of any Loss subject
to recovery under this Article VIII and Section 7.5(a) shall be calculated net
of any amounts specifically accrued or reserved for in the Closing Balance
Sheet or otherwise taken into account in the calculation of the Adjusted
Closing Consideration.

8.5. Indemnification Procedure. Promptly after the incurrence of any Losses by
any Purchaser Indemnified Person or Participating Holder Indemnified Person
(an "Indemnified Party"), or receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of a
Third Party Claim for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2 (an "Indemnifiable Claim"),
such Indemnified Party will give the Indemnification Control Person written
notice thereof (an "Indemnification Notice"); provided, however, that delay or
failure to so notify the Indemnification Control Person shall only relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations to the extent, if at all, that it is
materially prejudiced by reasons of such delay or failure. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe the Indemnifiable Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnification Control

 Person shall have a period of thirty (30) days within which to respond to such
Indemnification Notice. If the Indemnification Control Person accepts
responsibility for the entirety of such Indemnifiable Claim within such thirty
(30) day period, the Indemnification Control Person shall be entitled to
compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel chosen by the
Indemnification Control Person and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, such matter; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other
provision in this Section 8.5 to the contrary, Section 7.5(f) shall be the
exclusive provision governing procedures relating to indemnification if such
Indemnifiable Claim is a Tax Claim. If the Indemnification Control Person
rejects responsibility for the matter set forth in an Indemnification Notice
in whole or in part or does not respond within thirty (30) days after
receiving such Indemnification Notice, the Indemnified Party shall be free to
pursue, without prejudice to any of its rights hereunder, such remedies as may
be available to the Indemnified Party under applicable Law at the Indemnifying
Party's expense. The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the
Indemnification Control Person and its counsel in the defense against any such
Indemnifiable Claim. In any event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in a non-controlling manner and at its own expense in the
defense of such Indemnifiable Claim. The Indemnification Control Person shall
not enter into a settlement of such Indemnifiable Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and until such consent is obtained the
Indemnification Control Person shall continue the defense of such
Indemnifiable Claim. If a firm offer is made to settle an Indemnifiable Claim
(a) that is not a Tax Claim, (b) that does not involve any admission of
liability or wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates or the
creation of financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates, (c) provides for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Indemnifiable Claim, (d) does not involve injunctive relief binding upon the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, and (e) such settlement does not
encumber any of the material assets of any Indemnified Party or impose any
restriction or condition that would apply to or materially affect any
Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Party's business, and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within thirty (30)
days after its receipt of such notice, and also fails to assume defense of
such Indemnifiable Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Indemnifiable
Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Indemnifiable
Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to this
Section 8.5, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding any provisions in this Section 8.5 to
the contrary, the Indemnification Control Person shall not be entitled to
assume or continue control of the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim if (A)
such Indemnifiable Claim relates to or arises in connection with any
governmental proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (B)
such Indemnifiable Claim relates primarily to Intellectual Property; (C) such
Indemnifiable Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party; (D) the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by
counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party; or (E) the Indemnification
Control Person fails to defend such Indemnifiable Claim in good faith. If the
Indemnified Party controls the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
for its reasonable defense costs as such costs are incurred.

 8.6. Escrow Fund; Limitation on Remedies.

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, except as provided in Section 10.5(b) (Holder Representative) and
Section 10.11 (Specific Performance) or in respect of claims based upon fraud,
indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article VIII or Section
7.5(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any claim under this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this Agreement, except in
respect of claims (x) based upon fraud or arising under any breach of a
Company Fundamental Representation, (y) under Sections 8.1(c) or (d), or (z)
under Section 7.5(a) for indemnification or in respect of breaches of a
covenant therein, recovery against the Escrowed Funds and the Purchaser's
right to set-off under Section 8.9 shall be the Purchaser Indemnified Persons'
sole and exclusive remedies for any such claim for indemnification under this
Article VIII.

(c) Any and all amounts payable to Purchaser Indemnified Persons as a result
of any claim for indemnification under this Article VIII (other than Sections
8.1(c) or (d)) shall be satisfied (x) first out of the Escrowed Funds, if any,
(y) thereafter, and only in respect of any portion of indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Escrowed Funds, if any, from the Purchaser's right to set-off
under Section 8.9 and (z) thereafter, solely in respect of claims based upon
fraud or arising under any breach of a Company Fundamental Representation or
Stockholder Fundamental Representation or under Section 7.5(a) for
indemnification or in respect of breaches of a covenant therein, directly by
the Participating Holders.

(d) Any and all amounts payable to the Purchaser Indemnified Persons as a
result of any claim for indemnification under Sections 8.1(c) or (d), shall be
paid directly by the applicable Participating Holders to the Purchaser, by
wire payment of immediately available funds. Notwithstanding any provisions
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the limitations to
indemnification set forth in this Agreement shall not affect in any manner
(and shall not apply to) any claims against a Participating Holder based upon
fraud by such Participating Holder.

(e) The indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VIII are intended
as a bargained-for contractual remedy for the Indemnified Parties, contain all
of the terms and provisions that the Parties intend be applied in any
connection with any claim or action for indemnification pursuant to this
Article VIII and are intended to be enforced without regard to principles of
breach of contract or other Law that would result in a broader or narrower
remedy.

8.7. Adjustment to Purchase Price. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
any indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Adjusted Closing Consideration for Tax purposes.

8.8. Right to Bring Actions; No Contribution. Notwithstanding any provision in
this Article VIII or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, only the
Holder Representative shall have the right, power and authority to commence
any action, suit or proceeding after the Closing, by and on behalf of any or
all Participating Holders, against the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation
or any other Indemnifying Party in connection with this Agreement and the
Escrow

 Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and in no
event shall any Participating Holder himself, herself or itself have the right
to commence any action, suit or proceeding against the Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, or any other Indemnifying Party in such connection. By
virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Stockholders, each Participating Holder (regardless of whether or not such
Participating Holder votes in favor of the adoption of the Agreement and the
approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written consent in lieu
thereof) shall be deemed to have waived, and shall be deemed to have
acknowledged and agreed that such Participating Holder shall not have and
shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the
Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which he may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement or the related facts and circumstances underlying any such
indemnification obligation or other liability.

8.9. Set-Off. In addition to all other remedies contemplated herein, subject
to the limitations on recovery set forth in Section 8.4(a), the Purchaser may
set off, deduct or retain any amount due or payable to the Purchaser in
respect of any claim (for indemnification) against the Participating Holders
under Section 8.1 against any obligation of the Purchaser to pay any unpaid
Milestone Payment; provided, however, that, with respect to each Milestone
Payment, the Purchaser shall not set off, deduct or retain Losses from such
Milestone Payment (a) in the case of a claim arising from or under a Section
8.1(c) or Section 8.1(d), in excess of such Participating Holder's
Participating Holder Percentage of such Milestone Payment or (b) in the case
of any other claim for indemnification under Sections 8.1, in excess of 15% of
the aggregate amount of such Milestone Payment, except in the case of a claim
arising from or under (i) a breach of any Fundamental Representation, (ii)
fraud or (iii) Section 7.5(a) for indemnification or in respect of breaches of
a covenant therein or; provided, further, however, that Purchaser may carry-
forward and set-off against a future Milestone Payment the amount of any
Losses not deducted from a previous Milestone Payment as a result of the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.9 which carry-forward amount shall not
exceed 15% of such future Milestone Payment (taken together with any other
set-off against such future Milestone Payment) unless such Losses result from
(a) a claim arising from or under Section 9.1(c) or Section 9.1(d), in which
case such carry-forward amount shall not exceed such Participating Holders'
Participating Holder Percentage of such future Milestone Payment (taken
together with any other set-off against such future Milestone Payment) or (b)
a claim arising from or under (i) a breach of any Fundamental Representation,
(ii) fraud or (iii) Section 7.5(a) for indemnification or in respect of
breaches of a covenant therein.

Article IX

TERMINATION

9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and the Purchaser;

 (b) by the Company or the Purchaser by written notice to the other Party, if
any Governmental Order shall have been issued that restrains, enjoins or
otherwise prohibits the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such
Governmental Order shall have become final and nonappealable; provided,
however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)
shall not be available to a Party if such Governmental Order was primarily due
to the failure of such Party to perform any of its covenants or agreements
under this Agreement;

(c) by the Company or the Purchaser by written notice to the other Party, if
the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the date that is ninety (90) days
from the date of this Agreement (the "Initial Outside Date"); provided,
however, that (i) the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(c) shall not be available to Purchaser if the failure of Purchaser to
fulfill or breach by Purchaser of any obligation under this Agreement has been
the cause of, or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Initial Outside Date and shall not be available to the Company if the
failure of the Company or any Participating Holder to fulfill or breach by the
Company or any Participating Holder of any obligation under this Agreement has
been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
before the Initial Outside Date, and (ii) if any required HSR or other
antitrust approvals, waiting period expirations or terminations, or clearances
have not been obtained by the Initial Outside Date such date shall be extended
for an additional sixty (60) days unless the Company and the Purchaser
mutually agree in writing that the Initial Outside Date should not be so
extended;

(d) by the Purchaser by written notice to the Company, if the Company has
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 3.2(a) or Section 3.2(b) (other than as a result of a
material breach by Purchaser of any of its obligations under this Agreement)
and (ii) has not been cured by the Company within twenty (20) days after the
giving of written notice thereof from the Purchaser;

(e) by the Purchaser by written notice to the Company, if the Company has not
delivered evidence of the receipt of Stockholder Approval to the Purchaser
within twenty-four (24) hours after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement; or

(f) by the Company by written notice to the Purchaser, if the Purchaser has
breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach (i) would give rise to a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 3.3(a) or Section 3.3(b) (other than as a result of a
material breach by the Company or any Participating Holder of any of its
obligations under this Agreement) and (ii) has not been cured by the Purchaser
within twenty (20) days after the giving of written notice thereof from the
Company.

9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void
and have no effect and no Party shall have any claim arising under this
Agreement, except for the obligations of the parties contained in this Section
9.2 and in Section 7.3 (Disclosures), Section 10.1 (Expenses), Section 10.2
(Notices), Section 10.5(b) (Holder Representative), Section 10.10 (Governing
Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial) and Section 10.13 (Confidentiality),
and except that nothing herein will relieve or release

 any Party from Liability or Losses for any willful breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
prior to such termination.

of any change of address or facsimile number to which Notices are to be sent.

10.3. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in one or
more counterparts, and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

10.4. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all schedules and exhibits
hereto) and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties and their respective Affiliates with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings
among the Parties hereto and/or their respective Affiliates, oral or written,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

10.5. Appointment of Holder Representative.

(a) By virtue of execution of a Letter of Transmittal, the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Stockholders, the
Participating Holders hereby appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC
to act as the Participating Holders' true and lawful representative, attorney-
in-fact, agent and proxy (the "Holder Representative") under this Agreement
and the agreements ancillary hereto, with full power and authority, including
power of substitution, to take all actions on their behalf in connection with
this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto, including acting in the
name of and for and on behalf of such Participating Holders (i) to amend or
waive any provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, (ii) to review
and accept or dispute the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 4.2, (iii)
to handle, control and resolve, including by compromise with the Purchaser and
Merger Sub, all indemnification claims pursuant to Article VIII, and (iv) to
do all other things and to take all other action under or related to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement that the Holder Representative may consider
necessary or proper to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and to resolve any dispute with the Purchaser over any aspect of this
Agreement and, on behalf of such Participating Holders, to enter into any
agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing which shall have the effect of
binding such Participating Holders as if such Participating Holders had
personally entered into such an agreement. This appointment and power of
attorney shall be deemed as coupled with an interest and all authority
conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to termination
by operation of law, whether by the death or incapacity or liquidation or
dissolution of any Participating Holder or the occurrence of any other event
or events. The Holder Representative may resign at any time.

(b) The Holder Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect
to any action or omission by the Holder Representative in connection with its
services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto
(including the Escrow Agreement), except in the event of liability directly
resulting from the Holder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Holder Representative shall not be liable for any action or
omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Participating Holders shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the

 Holder Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and
expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Holder Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Holder Representative, the Holder
Representative will reimburse the Participating Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Holder
Representative by the Participating Holders, any such Representative Losses
may be recovered by the Holder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside, (ii) the Escrowed Funds only to the
extent such funds are otherwise available for distribution to Participating
Holders pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (iii) any
Milestone Payments at such time as any such amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Participating Holders; provided, that while this section
allows the Holder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Participating Holders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Holder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the Holder
Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf of the
Participating Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of the Participating Holders set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Holder Representative under this section. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Holder
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(c) Each Participating Holder agrees that the Holder Representative may
consult with counsel chosen by Holder Representative and shall have full and
complete authorization in good faith to act or refrain from acting in
accordance with the opinion of such counsel. The Holder Representative may
rely and shall be protected in acting, or refraining from acting, upon any
written notice, instruction or request furnished to the Holder Representative
hereunder and reasonably believed by the Holder Representative to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.

(d) The Holder Representative shall have the full power to execute and deliver
the Escrow Agreement and shall have all of the rights and shall perform all of
the obligations of the Holder Representative as set forth in the Escrow
Agreement and the Holder Representative shall have the exclusive right, power
and authority, on behalf of all the Participating Holders, to pursue, defend,
and settle any indemnification claims pursuant to Article VIII hereof and to
do all things and to take all other actions the Holder Representative may
consider necessary or proper to resolve any indemnification claims after the
Closing Date.

(e) The Purchaser may rely and shall be protected in acting, or refraining
from acting, upon any written notice, instruction or request furnished to it
hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement and reasonably believed by the
Purchaser to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the Holder
Representative as if such written notice, instruction or request had been
furnished to it by all the Participating Holders.

 (f) Upon the written agreement or consent of the Participating Holders
representing a majority of the Participating Holder Percentages, the
Participating Holders shall be entitled to change the Holder Representative by
delivery of a written notice to such effect to the Purchaser at any time, and
the Participating Holders covenant and agree to designate a replacement Holder
Representative as soon as practicable following the resignation or inability
to serve of the then current Holder Representative.

(g) Except for this Agreement, the Letters of Transmittal the Written Consent,
the SRS Confidentiality Agreement and the SRS Engagement Letter, (i) the
Holder Representative has not entered into (and will not after the date
hereof, without the prior consent of Purchaser, enter into) any Contract with
any Participating Holder that (A) affects the decision-making authority of the
Holder Representative and (B) is directly and specifically related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the Participating Holders
do not have in any Contract with the Holder Representative any requirements,
prerequisites or veto rights in connection with the Holder Representative's
fulfillment of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 10.5(g) shall not apply to any
agreements entered into after the date hereof between the Holder
Representative and one or more Participating Holders related to the
Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside or otherwise pertaining to the funding
of expenses incurred by the Holder Representative (e.g., agreements by
Participating Holders to contribute additional funds to the Representative
Reimbursement Set-Aside, expense contribution arrangements, etc.).

10.6. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement and in the schedules
and exhibits hereto are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in
any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

10.7. Succession and Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiary. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which such successors and permitted assigns will be
deemed to be a Party hereto for all purposes hereof. No Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other Parties; provided, however, that the Purchaser and/or Merger Sub may (a)
assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates or in a Rights Transfer Event to any Person and (b) designate one
or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder, in each case,
so long as no such assignment shall limit, affect or relieve the assignor from
any liability hereunder unless, in the case of a Rights Transfer Event, the
acquirer in connection with such assignment agrees to assume all of
Purchaser's obligations under Section 4.7 in a writing enforceable by the
Holder Representative. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is
for the sole benefit of the Parties, their permitted successors and assignees
and the Indemnified Parties (with the Indemnified Parties, with respect to
Article VIII, and the DandO Indemnified Parties, with respect to Section 7.12,
being express third party beneficiaries) and nothing herein expressed or
implied will give or be construed to give any Person, other than the Parties
and such successors and assignees, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.
Notwithstanding the anything in this Section 10.7 to the contrary, Section
10.5 (Holder

 Representative) shall be binding upon, and enforceable by the Holder
Representative against, the Participating Holders.

10.8. Amendments, Modifications and Waivers. The Parties hereto may amend or
modify this Agreement (a) prior to the Closing, only with a written instrument
executed by the Purchaser and the Company or (b) after the Closing, only with
a written instrument executed by the Purchaser and the Holder Representative.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar),
shall constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided nor
shall be effective unless in writing and executed (i) by the Purchaser in the
case of a waiver by the Purchaser, (ii) by Merger Sub in the case of a waiver
by Merger Sub, (iii) by the Company in the case of a waiver by the Company and
(iv) by the Holder Representative in the case of a waiver by the Holder
Representative. No waiver by any Party of any breach or violation of, or
default under or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent breach, violation, default of, or inaccuracy in, any such
representation, warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights
arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay or
omission on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or remedy
under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.

10.9. Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each representation,
warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If
any Party has breached or violated, or if there is an inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact
that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the
same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which
the Party has not breached or violated, or in respect of which there is not an
inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party has
breached or violated, or there is an inaccuracy in, the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

10.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
in tort or by statute) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter
into this Agreement), shall be governed by, construed and enforced in
accordance with, and be subject to the remedies available under the internal
laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of limitation, without
regard to the conflicts of law principles of such state.

(b) With respect to any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether sounding in contract, tort or
otherwise (each, a "Proceeding"), each Party irrevocably (i) agrees and
consents to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware state

 court sitting in Wilmington, and (ii) waives any objection which it may have
at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceeding brought in any such
court, waives any claim that such Proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to
such Proceeding, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such
Party. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall not constitute general
consent to service of process in the State of Delaware for any purpose except
as provided above and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the respective Parties to this Agreement. Each Party irrevocably agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document by United States
registered mail to such Party's address set forth above shall be effective
service of process for any action, suit or proceeding with respect to any
matters for which it has submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION AS
BETWEEN THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE NEGOTIATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER
OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO.
EACH PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.10(c).

10.11. Specific Performance. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement, including obligations to deliver items to the
other Party prior to the Closing, are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
Parties agrees that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the other
Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding
instituted in any court of the United States or any state thereof having
jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity. Each Party further agrees
that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such
breach or violation, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law would
be adequate. Further, each Party agrees that in any action for specific
performance brought to enforce a Party's obligations under this agreement, if
specific performance or other equitable relief is granted, the Party obtaining
such remedy or relief shall be entitled to be reimbursed for its reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with such action, including its attorney's
fees and expenses.

10.12. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of

 being enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to affect the original intent of the Parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

10.13. Confidentiality.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until five (5) years following the earlier
to occur of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX or the
Closing, each Party agrees to keep in confidence and not to disclose to any
Third Party (other than an Affiliate of the Purchaser) any Confidential
Information of any other Party without the prior written consent of the
disclosing Party, except (i) pursuant to, and in order to carry out, the terms
and objectives of or its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
as expressly permitted by this Agreement. Following the Closing, the Holder
Representative agrees to keep in confidence and not to disclose to any Third
Party (which shall not include any Participating Holder; provided that such
Participating Holder complies with the requirements set forth in Section
10.13(e)), without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, any
Confidential Information of the Purchaser or the Company.

(b) The restrictions on the disclosure of Confidential Information set forth
in Section 10.13(a) and use of Confidential Information as set forth in
Section 10.13(d) shall not apply to any Confidential Information that:

(i) is known by the receiving Party at the time of its receipt, and not
through a prior disclosure by the disclosing Party;

(ii) is in the public domain through no breach of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement by the receiving Party;

(iii) is subsequently disclosed to the receiving Party by a Third Party who is
not to the receiving Party's knowledge under an obligation of confidentiality
to the disclosing Party;

(iv) is developed by the receiving Party independently of information received
from the disclosing Party.

The burden of proof that one of the above exceptions is true shall be with the
receiving Party claiming such exception.

(c) The confidentiality obligations contained in this Section 10.13 shall not
apply to the extent that disclosure by the receiving Party of the disclosing
Party's Confidential Information is reasonably necessary for compliance (by
the receiving Party or its Affiliates) with an applicable Law, regulation of a
governmental agency or a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that, to
the extent permitted under Law, the receiving Party shall first give prior
written notice thereof to the disclosing Party such that the disclosing Party
shall have an opportunity to seek a protective order limiting any such
disclosure and such disclosure is limited to the extent actually required by
such Law. The receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of the
provisions of this Section 10.13, by such Party's Affiliates who receive
Confidential Information from the disclosing Party.

 (d) From the date of this Agreement until five (5) years following the earlier
to occur of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX or the
Closing, each Party shall use the Confidential Information of the other Party
only to the extent required to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. Each
Party will use at least the same standard of care as it uses to protect
proprietary or confidential information of its own (but in no event less than
reasonable care) to ensure that its employees, agents, consultants and other
Representatives do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of the
Confidential Information of the other Party.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (i) the
Holder Representative may disclose Confidential Information to legal counsel
and other advisors and Representatives under an obligation of confidentiality
and non-use substantially similar to the terms of this Section 10.13 in their
capacity as such (for the purpose of advising the Holder Representative in
connection with this Agreement), (ii) the Holder Representative (or legal
counsel or other advisors or Representatives to whom information is disclosed
pursuant to clause (i) above) may disclose such nonpublic information solely
as required in any Proceeding or investigation by a Governmental Entity
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)
the Holder Representative may disclose to any Participating Holder any
information disclosed to the Holder Representative subject to such
Participating Holder agreeing in writing to restrictions on the disclosure and
use of such information consistent with the restrictions to which the Holder
Representative is subject.

(f) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser and its Affiliates
may presently have internal development programs relating to the subject
matter of the Confidential Information, or may undertake such development
programs at a future date, or may receive information on the same or related
subject matter from third parties, and may develop and commercialize products
and/or services relating to such subject matter independently or in
cooperation with such third parties. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed to impose on either Party any restriction, duty or obligation
concerning the Confidential Information disclosed hereunder other than that of
non-disclosure and non-use as expressly provided in this Section 10.13.

Option Surrender Agreement





[•], 2018



Dear BeneVir Biopharm Option Holder:



On May 1, 2018, BeneVir Biopharm, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("Purchaser"),
and Dogfish Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), and
Shareholder Representative Services, LLC, solely in its capacity as the Holder
Representative (as defined in the Merger Agreement, hereinafter the "Holder
Representative") entered into a Merger Agreement (the "Merger Agreement").
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the proposed merger (the "Merger") of Merger
Sub with and into the Company is expected to be consummated and become
effective on or about [•], 2018, subject to certain conditions to the closing
of the Merger. The effective time of the Merger is referred to below as the
"Effective Time." Terms used in this Option Surrender Agreement (this
"Agreement") that are capitalized and not otherwise defined in context will
have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached hereto as Annex I.



For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Option" is an Option to purchase
Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of the Effective Time (whether
vested or unvested). In connection with the Merger, at the Effective Time,
each Company Option shall be canceled and extinguished at the Effective Time
and shall be converted into the right to receive payment in the following
amounts (such aggregate amount, the "Company Option Consideration"), subject
to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement:



(i) an amount equal to the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option multiplied
by (2) the excess, if any, of (a) the Company Equity Per Share Amount over (b)
the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the "Company Option
Closing Consideration"); and



(ii) in each case, when, if and to the extent payable, (1) an amount equal to
each Company Milestone Payment Per Share Amount, plus (2) an amount equal to
the Company Adjustment Per Share Amount, plus (3) an amount equal to the
Company Escrow Release Per Share Amount, plus (4) an amount equal to the
Company Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside Release Per Share Amount.



The Company Option Consideration will be paid by the Surviving Corporation or,
if applicable, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system and will be
reduced by the sum of (i) any applicable tax withholding required under any
provision of U.S., state, local or foreign tax law; and (ii) any other
reductions, adjustments and contingencies, as described in the Merger
Agreement.



Listed in the enclosed report incorporated hereto as Annex II are all the
Company Options held by the undersigned according to the Company's records
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Listed Options").



By signing this Agreement below, the undersigned acknowledges and agrees as
follows:



| 
---|--- 

a)

|

Other than the Listed Options, listed on Annex II, the undersigned holds no
Company Options and no contractual rights to be granted Company Options, in
either case, representing the right to purchase Company Common Stock, or any
other instrument that is settled or exercisable for Company Common Stock. 

 

| 
---|--- 

b)

|

The undersigned agrees that the number of Company Options set forth on Annex
II accurately and fairly represents all Company Options to which the
undersigned is or was entitled as of the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested. 

 

| 
---|--- 

c)

|

The undersigned represents and warrants (i) that the undersigned owns the
Listed Options, free and clear of all liens, claims, restrictions, pledges,
security interests and encumbrances, (ii) that there is no contractual
obligation pursuant to which the undersigned has, directly or indirectly,
granted any option, warrant or other right to any Person to acquire any of the
undersigned's Listed Options, (iii) the undersigned has full power and
authority to perform the obligations of the undersigned under this Agreement,
and that, if applicable, such matters have been duly authorized by all
necessary action (corporate or otherwise) on the part of the undersigned, (iv)
the undersigned is not required to give any notice to, make any filing with,
or obtain any authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Entity in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and (v) there
are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the undersigned's
knowledge, threatened against the undersigned at law or in equity, or before
any Governmental Entity, that would adversely affect the undersigned's
performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

 

| 
---|--- 

d)

|

Each of the obligations of the undersigned under this Agreement constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the undersigned, enforceable against
the undersigned in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity). 

 

| 
---|--- 

e)

|

Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the undersigned of its
obligations under this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement: (i) shall result in a material breach or
violation of, or default under any contractual obligation of the undersigned,
or (ii) materially violate any Law or other legal restriction to which the
undersigned is subject. 

 

| 
---|--- 

f)

|

Subject to consummation of the Merger, the undersigned will be or is entitled
to receive, with respect to the undersigned's Listed Options, only the Company
Option Consideration, less applicable Transaction Payroll Taxes as of the date
of such payment. 

 

| 
---|--- 

g)

|

At the Effective Time, all of the undersigned's Company Options will be or
were cancelled, terminated and extinguished and (except for the right to
receive the Company Option Consideration as described above) be or are of no
further force or effect. 

 

| 
---|--- 

h)

|

Each contract, agreement, or arrangement (other than this Agreement)
concerning all of the undersigned's Company Options shall be or were
terminated effective as of, and conditioned on, the Closing, and the
undersigned shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
any 

 further documentation reasonably requested by the Company or Purchaser to give
effect to or evidence the foregoing.



| 
---|--- 

i)

|

Payments to be made to the undersigned are subject to the terms of (i) the
Merger Agreement and (ii) an escrow agreement, entered into as of the Closing
Date by and among Purchaser, the Holder Representative and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, National Association, as the escrow agent (the "Escrow Agreement"), and
the undersigned will be bound and abide by the provisions of the Merger
Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 4.4(b) (Withholding),
Article VIII (Indemnification) and Section 10.5 (Holder Representative)
thereof), the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

j)

|

Certain deductions will be or were made from the Closing Consideration under
the Merger Agreement at the Effective Time to satisfy the discharge of the
Company's Indebtedness (if any), Transaction Expenses, certain Transaction
Closing Payroll Taxes, and to fund the Indemnity Escrow Deposit and the
Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside. Such deductions were used to calculate
the Company Option Consideration to which each such holder of Company Options
is entitled in accordance with Section 2.2(f)(ii) of the Merger Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

k)

|

After the Closing, Purchaser may be entitled to make an additional deduction
from the Closing Consideration under the Merger Agreement due to any
adjustment required pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

l)

|

After the Closing, Milestone Payments may be payable by Purchaser for
disbursement to the Participating Holders, pursuant to Sections 2.2(f)(ii) and
4.7 of the Merger Agreement, in the event that the Surviving Corporation
successfully achieves a Milestone by accomplishing the applicable Development
Milestone Event or Commercial Milestone Event for such Milestone which
determination shall be made as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Prior to
disbursement to the Participating Holders, Additional Transaction Expenses, if
any, and applicable Transaction Post-Closing Payroll Taxes, if any, will be
deducted from the Milestone Payments. You hereby acknowledge that the
Milestone Payments are dependent on a variety of factors set forth in the
Merger Agreement and that it is possible that the Milestone Payments may never
be made by Purchaser. Subject to and in accordance with Section 8.9 of the
Merger Agreement, Milestone Payments which were previously unpaid are also
subject to Purchaser's rights of setoff to satisfy its indemnification claims
against Participating Holders under Section7.5(a) and Article VIII of the
Merger Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

m)

|

The undersigned has received and had the opportunity to review a copy of the
Merger Agreement and has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive
answers concerning the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement and has consulted with (or has had the opportunity to but has
decided not to consult) the undersigned's own legal, accounting, tax and
financial advisors regarding this Agreement and the Merger Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

n)

|

The undersigned understands that $17,500,000 of the proceeds of the Merger
(the "Indemnity Escrow Deposit") will be deposited into the Escrow Account to
secure certain indemnification obligations and Closing Consideration
adjustments related to Company cash under the Merger Agreement, and $250,000
of the proceeds of the Merger (the "Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside")
will be deposited to an account designated by the Holder Representative to
secure expenses of the Holder Representative in its capacity to act on the
undersigned's behalf and on behalf of the other Participating Holders,
pursuant to Section 10.5 of the Merger Agreement, with regard to all matters 

 pertaining to indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement, including to
defend, compromise or settle any such claim, among other matters.



| 
---|--- 

o)

|

Fifteen (15) months after the Closing, Purchaser and Holder Representative
will instruct the Escrow Agent to deposit with the Paying Agent, for
disbursement to the Participating Holders, the then-remaining amount left in
the Escrow Account minus any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit (as
defined below) subject to pending claims for indemnification under Section
7.5(a) or Article VIII of the Merger Agreement and any adjustment pursuant to
Section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement, if any and only to the extent not already
paid. Any remaining portion of the Indemnity Escrow Deposit, after payment and
satisfaction of any and all pending claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.5(a) or Article VIII of the Merger Agreement and any previously
unpaid adjustment, if any, required pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Merger
Agreement, shall be deposited as follows: (i) the portion of any such amount
payable to the Stockholders shall be released to the Paying Agent by the
Escrow Agent for disbursement to the Participating Holders and (ii) the
portion of any such amount payable to the holders of Company Options shall be
released by the Escrow Agent to the Surviving Corporation for disbursement to
the holders of such Company Options. For purposes of this subsection (o), any
disbursements made to the Participating Holders shall be in accordance with
the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any applicable Plan or
Contracts to which the Company is subject, bound or a party ("Company
Contract"), and shall be subject to any applicable withholding. 

 

| 
---|--- 

p)

|

The Representative Reimbursement Set-Aside will terminate in the sole
discretion of the Holder Representative in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement (the "Holder Representative Reserve
Termination Date"). Any amounts remaining in the Representative Reimbursement
Set-Aside (if any), less any losses, fees, costs or expenses incurred by the
Holder Representative in connection with its services as Holder
Representative, shall be disbursed to the Participating Holders, in accordance
with the Merger Agreement and any applicable Plan or Company Contract, subject
to any applicable withholding, promptly after the Representative Reimbursement
Set-Aside Termination Date. 

 

| 
---|--- 

q)

|

Pursuant to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, amounts may be deducted from
the Escrow Account maintained pursuant to the Escrow Agreement for
indemnification obligations of the Company due to breaches by the Company of
certain provisions of the Merger Agreement and other certificates and
documents delivered by the Company in connection therewith. For Losses arising
out of or relating to (i) claims based upon breaches of covenants by the
Company under the Merger Agreement or any certificate, agreement or other
document delivered by the Company in connection with the Merger Agreement,
(ii) claims based upon fraud by the Company in connection with the Merger
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated thereby, (iii)
claims based upon breaches of any Company Fundamental Representations, (iv)
claims based upon breaches by the undersigned of any of its representations or
covenants included in this Agreement, (v) disputes in connection with the
allocation of the Merger Consideration or Company Option Consideration, and
(vi) indemnification for pre-Closing Taxes of the Company or claims based upon
breaches of Section 7.5 of the Merger Agreement, the undersigned may be
obligated up to the total amount of the Merger Consideration and Company
Option Consideration actually paid to the undersigned (including by reduction
or offset of your respective portion of the Milestone Payments which were
previously unpaid). 

 

| 
---|--- 

r)

|

Effective upon the Closing, except with respect to a claim arising out of the
Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and all other ancillary agreements,
documents or instruments to be delivered in 

 connection with the Merger Agreement or therewith, the undersigned hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives, fully releases and forever discharges
any of the Company, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and their past and
present directors, officers, employees, agents, predecessors, successors,
assigns, equityholders, partners, insurers and Affiliates (the "Released
Parties") from any and all Liabilities and Actions of any kind or nature
whatsoever arising from, in connection with, or related to your standing,
status or capacity as a direct or indirect holder of equity interests of the
Company, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated and known or unknown (the "Claims") with respect to facts and
circumstances existing at or prior to the Effective Time that have been or
could be asserted against a Released Party, and upon your receipt of the
amounts required to be paid to you by the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of
the Purchaser) pursuant to the terms (and subject to the conditions) of the
Merger Agreement, the undersigned covenants not to (i) sue or (ii) participate
in any civil action against, any of the Released Parties with respect to such
Claims and shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or
thereunder from such Released Parties. Such released Liabilities shall include
any right to recover against the Released Parties for any indemnification
claims made against or paid by the undersigned pursuant to Article VIII of the
Merger Agreement. The undersigned understands that this is a full and final
release of all claims, demands, causes of action and Liabilities of any nature
whatsoever, whether or not known, suspected or claimed, that could have been
asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding against the Released Parties
arising from, in connection with, or related to your standing, status or
capacity as a direct or indirect holder of equity interests of the Company,
except as expressly set forth in this subsection (r). For the avoidance of
doubt, the foregoing release shall not apply and none of the following shall
be released by the undersigned: (A) if the undersigned is an employee of the
Company, Claims for any benefit, wages or salary earned by the undersigned
arising out of or related to the undersigned's employment by the Company to
the extent earned and unpaid (other than in respect of any option to purchase
Company Common Stock that may have been promised to the undersigned but that
was not granted by the Company), (B) Claims and rights for indemnification and
reimbursement by the Company under the charter, bylaws and under any
indemnification agreement entered into by the Company and the undersigned and
(C) the undersigned's Claims as a customer or licensor of the Company. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the undersigned expressly waives the
benefit of any Law, which, if applied to the release set forth above, would
otherwise exclude from its binding effect any Claim not known by the Released
Parties at the Effective Time to exist. Without limiting the foregoing, if the
undersigned is a resident of the State of California, the undersigned
acknowledges that the undersigned has read Section 1542 of the Civil Code of
the State of California, which states in full: "A general release does not
extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his
or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or
her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor." The
undersigned expressly waives any right which the undersigned has or may have
under Section 1542 to the full extent that the undersigned may lawfully waive
such rights pertaining to the release set forth in this subsection (r). The
undersigned represents that the undersigned is not aware of any Claim by the
undersigned other than the Claims that are waived, released and forever
discharged by this subsection (r). For the avoidance of doubt, the release set
forth in this subsection (r) is an integral part of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and, without such release,
Purchaser would not have entered into the Merger Agreement.



| 
---|--- 

s)

|

The undersigned hereby acknowledges, ratifies and agrees to the appointment of
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Holder Representative, and any
successor Holder Representative, in accordance with the terms and conditions
of Section 10.5 of the Merger Agreement. The undersigned further agrees that
the Holder Representative is an express and intended 

 third-party beneficiary of, and is entitled to rely on, this Agreement in
consummating the transactions contemplated by, and acting as the Holder
Representative in accordance with, the Merger Agreement.



In order to receive the Company Option Consideration, after carefully
reviewing the contents of this Agreement, the undersigned must sign and return
it as soon as possible to the address set forth below. If this Agreement is
not fully and accurately completed, payment in respect of Company Options may
be delayed.

n)

|

effective upon the Closing, except with respect to a claim arising out of the
Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other ancillary agreements,
documents or instruments to be delivered in connection with the Merger
Agreement or therewith, you hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive,
fully release and forever discharge the Company, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and their past and present directors, officers, employees, agents,
predecessors, successors, assigns, equityholders, partners, insurers and
Affiliates (the "Released Parties") from any and all Liabilities and Actions
of any kind or nature whatsoever arising from, in connection with, or related
to your standing, status or capacity as a current or former employee, service
provider or direct or indirect holder of equity interests or indebtedness of
the Company, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated and known or unknown (the "Claims"), and upon your receipt of the
amounts required to be paid to you by the Paying Agent at Closing (on behalf
of the Purchaser) pursuant to the terms (and subject to the conditions) of the
Merger Agreement, you covenant not to (i) sue or (ii) participate in any civil
action against, any of Released Parties with respect to such Claims and shall
not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from
such Released Parties. Such released Liabilities shall include any right to
recover against the Released Parties for any indemnification claims made
against or paid by you pursuant to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement. You
understand that this is a full and final release of all claims, demands,
causes of action and Liabilities of any nature whatsoever, whether or not
known, suspected or claimed, that could have been asserted in any legal or
equitable proceeding against the Released Parties arising from, in connection
with, or related to your standing, status or capacity as a current or former
employee, service provider or direct or indirect holder of equity interests or
indebtedness of the Company, except as expressly set forth in this subsection
(n). For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing release shall not apply and
none of the following shall be released by you: (A) if you are an employee of
the Company, Claims for any benefit, wages or salary earned by you arising out
of or related to your employment by the Company to the extent earned and
unpaid (other than in respect of any option to purchase Company Capital Stock
that may have been promised to you but that was not granted by the Company),
(B) Claims and rights for indemnification and reimbursement by the Company
under the Charter, bylaws and under any indemnification agreement entered into
by the Company and you and (C) your Claims as a customer or licensor of the
Company, including, without limitation, under any contract between you and the
Company related to your status as a customer or licensor of the Company
("Commercial Arrangements"), provided that you shall be subject to the no-
circular recovery provisions set forth in Section 8.8 of the Merger Agreement.
To the extent permitted by applicable Law, you expressly waive the benefit of
any Law, which, if applied to the release set forth above, would otherwise
exclude from its binding effect any Claim not known by the Released Parties at
the Effective Time to exist. Without limiting the foregoing, if you are a
resident of the State of California, you acknowledge that you have read
Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, 

 

which states in full: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially
affected his or her settlement with the debtor." You expressly waive any right
which you have or may have under Section 1542 to the full extent that you may
lawfully waive such rights pertaining to the release set forth in this
subsection (n). You represent that you are not aware of any Claim by you other
than the Claims that are waived, released and forever discharged by this
subsection (n). The release set forth in this subsection (n) is an integral
part of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and, without such release, none of the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub would
have entered into the Merger Agreement;



| 
---|--- 

o)

|

you understand that, after the Closing, Milestone Payments may be payable by
Purchaser for disbursement to the Participating Holders, pursuant to Sections
2.2(f)(i) and Section 4.7 of the Merger Agreement, in the event that the
Surviving Corporation successfully achieves a Milestone, which determination
shall be made as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Prior to disbursement to
the Participating Holders, Additional Transaction Expenses, if any and
Transaction Post-Closing Payroll Taxes, if any, will be deducted from the
Milestone Payments. You hereby acknowledge that the Milestone Payments are
dependent on a variety of factors set forth in the Merger Agreement and that
it is possible that the Milestone Payments may never be made by Purchaser.
Subject to and in accordance with Section 8.9 of the Merger Agreement,
Milestone Payments which were previously unpaid are also subject to
Purchaser's rights of setoff to satisfy its indemnification claims against
Participating Holders under Section 7.5(a) and Article VIII of the Merger
Agreement; 

 

| 
---|--- 

p)

|

you acknowledge and agree that the success of the Surviving Corporation after
the Merger depends upon the continued preservation of the confidentiality of
the confidential or proprietary information of the Company possessed by you
and that the preservation of the confidentiality of such confidential or
proprietary information by you is an integral part of the Merger. Accordingly,
you hereby agree that you will not, and that you will cause your successors,
assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives (each, a
"Related Person") not to, at any time on or after the date hereof, directly or
indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, disclose or
use, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation in your possession and/or the possession of your Related
Persons; provided, however, that the information subject to the foregoing
provisions of this sentence will not include any information generally
available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in
violation hereof), available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Company or the Holder Representative or that is independently
discovered or developed by you or on your behalf without the use of any
confidential or proprietary information of the Company or the Surviving
Corporation; and provided, further, that the provisions of this subsection (p)
will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or disclosure (i)
reasonably necessary to be disclosed in prosecuting or defending litigation,
including responding to a subpoena in a third party litigation, or (ii)
required by any applicable legal requirement, in each case of clauses (i) and
(ii), so long as, to the extent permitted by applicable legal requirements,
reasonable prior notice is given to the Purchaser of such disclosure and a
reasonable opportunity is afforded to the Purchaser to contest the same. You
agree to refrain from publicly announcing or publicly disclosing the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, including the amount of the Net Merger
Consideration, without the prior approval of the Purchaser; provided, however,
that (i) you may disclose such information to your current and 

 

prospective limited partners and investors, solely to the extent required as
part of ordinary course reporting provided that you inform such limited
partners and investors of the confidential nature of such obligations,
provided, further, that any such Persons to which such information is
disclosed shall have a fiduciary, contractual or other duty to maintain the
confidentiality of such information and you agree that you shall be liable for
any breaches by such Persons of the confidentiality obligations in this
subsection (p) and (ii) in the event of any conflict between the provisions of
this subsection (p) and the provisions of any Commercial Arrangements between
you and the Company, the applicable provisions of your Commercial Arrangements
with the Company shall govern and control your obligations with respect to the
confidential and proprietary information of the Company; and

you hereby acknowledge, ratify and agree to the appointment of Shareholder
Representative Services LLC as the Holder Representative, and any successor
Holder Representative, in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section
10.5 of the Merger Agreement. The undersigned further agrees that the Holder
Representative is an express and intended third-party beneficiary of, and is
entitled to rely on, this Letter of Transmittal in consummating the

3\. IRS Tax Forms



| 
---|--- 

•

|

Under United States federal income tax laws, a U.S. holder who receives cash
payments pursuant to the Merger is required to provide the Paying Agent (as
payer) with such holder's correct TIN on a duly executed IRS Form W-9 (or
otherwise establish a basis for exemption from backup withholding) and certify
under penalty of perjury that such TIN is correct and that such holder is not
subject to backup withholding. If such holder is an individual, the TIN is his
or her social security number. If the Paying Agent is not provided with the
correct TIN, a $50 penalty may be imposed by the Internal Revenue Service and
the payment of any cash pursuant to the Merger may be subject to backup
withholding. 

 

Certain holders of Shares (including, among others, all corporations and
foreign individuals and entities) are not subject to these backup withholding
and reporting requirements. Exempt U.S. holders should indicate their exempt
status on IRS Form W-9. In order for a foreign individual to qualify as an
exempt recipient, such individual must submit a Form W-8 BEN, W-8BEN-E,
W-8IMY, W-8ECI or W-8EXP, as applicable (including any attachments thereto),
signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to such individual's exempt
status. Each Form W-8 can be obtained via the link below.



If backup withholding applies, the Paying Agent is required to withhold at a
rate not to exceed 28% of any payments made to the holder or other payee.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the Federal income tax
liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
amount of tax withheld provided that the required information is given to the
IRS. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be
obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.





Is the registered holder of the Certificate(s) a U.S. person (defined in the
General Instructions of the IRS tax form), or do you have a U.S. Resident tax
status? If so:



| 
---|--- 

•

|

Complete the IRS Form W-9; 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Check the appropriate box for federal tax classification; 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Provide your COMPLETE address, including number, street, city, and zip code; 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Provide your 9-Digit Social Security Number or Employee Identification Number;
and 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Sign and Date the IRS tax form. 

 

Is the registered holder of the Certificate(s) a person or entity domiciled
outside of the United States? If so:



| 
---|--- 

•

|

Complete the appropriate IRS Form W-8, found on the IRS website (www.irs.gov)
or included online in the Escrow Services Portal; and 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Sign and Date the IRS tax form. 

 

NOTE

Please consult your tax professional with any questions regarding which tax
form is appropriate or how to fill out the form.

| 
---|--- 

•

|

Include your original Certificate(s) (if your Shares are certificated) that
has been provided to you by the Company.

uncertificated.

form, original Certificates and other supporting documents (as applicable) for

5\. Miscellaneous Instructions and Agreements

| 
---|--- 

•

|

| 
---|--- 

1)

|

The name appearing in Box A differs from the name appearing on the Company's
stock ledger; 

|

|

Otherwise as required by the Paying Agent. 

 



A Medallion Signature Guarantee is also required on any stock power
transferring ownership of the Shares to someone who is not the registered
holder.



Signatures required to be guaranteed on the Letter of Transmittal or on a
stock power must be guaranteed by an eligible guarantor institution pursuant
to Rule 17Ad-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. Institutions that may be able to provide a Medallion Signature
Guarantee include U.S. banks, credit unions, trust companies, national
securities exchanges, broker/dealers, clearing agencies, municipal securities

Delivery of Original Certificates

| 
---|--- 

•

|

The Certificate(s), if such Certificate(s) exists, and any other required

overnight delivery service. Risk of loss and title of the Certificate(s) shall
pass only upon delivery of such documents to the Paying Agent. 

 

Completion of the Letter of Transmittal

•

|

If the Paying Agent determines that any Letter of Transmittal or IRS tax form
has not been properly completed or executed, or that a Certificate is not in
proper form for surrender, or if any other irregularity in connection with the
surrender exists, the Paying Agent shall be entitled (but not obligated) to
consult with the Purchaser or the Holder Representative for further
instructions and may reject the Letter of Transmittal, IRS tax form,
Certificate(s), and other document. If there are any discrepancies between the
number of Shares that any Letter of Transmittal, IRS tax form, Certificate or
other supporting document may indicate are owned by a Stockholder, the Paying
Agent shall consult with the Purchaser for instructions as to the Shares, if
any, it is authorized to accept for payment, and shall, except as thereafter
directed in writing by the Purchaser, continue to hold any Certificates and
other documents surrendered in connection therewith. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Paying Agent does not receive a duly executed IRS tax form on or
prior to the date payment is to be made, the Paying Agent shall be permitted
to withhold from payments to be made to the holder pursuant to the Merger
Agreement any required withholding Tax.
