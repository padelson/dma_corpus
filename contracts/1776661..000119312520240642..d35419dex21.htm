converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital

Section 3.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place (a) electronically by the mutual exchange of electronic
signatures (including portable document format (PDF)) commencing as promptly

required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such

any cash or in-kind dividend (other than any dividend in the form of
additional shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock, which dividend shall be

Common Stock then the Target Share Price shall be deemed to have been reduced
for all purposes of this Agreement by the amount of such cash dividend or the
fair market value of the in-kind dividend, as applicable, paid with respect to
each share of Acquiror Class A Common Stock. If Acquiror shall at any time
during the Rollover Performance Period pay any dividend on shares of Acquiror
Class A Common Stock by the issuance of additional shares of

Acquiror Class A Common Stock, then in each such case, (i) the Rollover
Performance Share Consideration shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Acquiror
Class A Common Stock (including any other shares so reclassified as Acquiror
Class A Common Stock) outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event, and (ii) the Target
Share Price shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to Topco the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

(c) In the event that a Liquidity Event occurs during the Rollover Performance
Period and the Liquidity Event Consideration in such Liquidity Event is
greater than the Target Share Price, then the Rollover Performance Share
Consideration shall automatically vest, and the Rollover Performance Share
Consideration shall be deemed issued and outstanding pursuant to and
as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.04(a)_ effective immediately prior to
the consummation of such Liquidity Event and Topco shall be entitled to
receive the corresponding Liquidity Event Consideration.

 

(d) Topco shall not have the right to vote the Rollover Performance Share
Consideration unless and until Topco vests in the Rollover Performance Share
Consideration. In the event that the Rollover Performance Share Consideration

Share Consideration shall automatically and without further action
be cancelled and forfeited by Topco as of the last day of the Rollover
Performance Period, and Topco shall have no further right or interest in or
with respect to the Rollover Performance Share Consideration. Except for the
right to vote and the treatment with respect to dividends which is addressed

stockholder with respect to the Rollover Performance Share Consideration,
subject to the vesting and forfeiture conditions set forth herein.

any such agreements that are commercial contracts not primarily relating to
Taxes).

(k) The Company has not taken any action (nor permitted any action to be
taken), and is not aware of any fact or circumstance, that, would reasonably
be expected to prevent the Merger, taken together, from constituting a

integrity of the IT Systems, the confidentiality of the source code of any
Company Software, and the security of all data stored in the IT Systems or

requirement under the applicable license for such Open Source Software to
disclose any source code of the Company Software, distribute such Company
software at no or minimal charge, or permit the redistribution or creation of
derivative works or of such Company Software by any licensee. Except for
consultants and other independent contractors engaged by the Company or any of

are, in the reasonable determination of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
commercially reasonable and in accordance with standard industry practice. In
the last twelve (12) months, there has not been any material failure with
respect to any of the IT Systems that has not been remedied or replaced in all
material respects. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company Software and
IT Systems are free of any malicious Software including viruses, worms,

alter, delete, destroy or disable any of the IT Systems or Company Software.

Security Requirements_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries have in place
commercially reasonable policies, procedures and systems for receiving and
appropriately responding to requests from individuals concerning their
Personal Information. None of the Companys or its Subsidiaries privacy
policies or notices contain any material omissions or are misleading or
deceptive in any material respect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have in
place reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to
protect Personal Information, Company Data and confidential data against loss,
theft, misuse or unauthorized access, use, modification, alteration,
destruction or disclosure. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries, there have
been no actual or alleged breaches, security incidents, misuse of or
unauthorized access to the IT Systems, which has resulted in the unauthorized

(z) __ in the opinion of legal counsel of the Company would result in the

reasonable advance notice, in such manner as to not interfere with the normal
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and so long as reasonably
feasible or permissible under applicable Law, to all of their properties,
books, Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, records and appropriate officers
and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall use its and
their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish such Representatives with
all financial and operating data and other information concerning the affairs
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are in the possession of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, in each case, as Acquiror and its Representatives may
reasonably request solely for purposes of consummating the Transactions. Any
request pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be made in a time and manner so
as not to delay the Closing. All information obtained by Acquiror and its
Representatives under this Agreement shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement prior to the Closing.

 

Section 6.03 _No_ _Claim_ ___Against_ _the_ _Trust Account_. The Company and
Topco each acknowledges that it has read Acquirors final prospectus, dated
July 15, 2019 and other SEC Reports, the Acquiror Organizational Documents,
and the Trust Agreement and understands that Acquiror has established the
Trust Account described therein for the benefit of Acquirors public
stockholders and that disbursements from the Trust Account are available only
in the limited circumstances set forth in the Trust Agreement. The Company and
Topco further acknowledges that, if the Transactions, or, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement, another Business Combination, are not
consummated by July 15, 2021 or such later date as approved by the
stockholders of Acquiror to complete a Business Combination, Acquiror will be
obligated to return to its stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust
Account. Accordingly, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each of the Company and Topco (on behalf of itself and their
respective Affiliates, Representatives and equityholders) hereby irrevocably
waives any past, present or future right, title, interest or claim (whether
based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability) of any
kind against, and irrevocably waives any right to access, the Trust Account,
the Trustee and Acquiror, or to collect from the Trust Account any monies that
may be owed to them by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for any reason
whatsoever, and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account at any time
for any reason whatsoever. This _Section_ __ _ 6.03_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement for any reason. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Companys or Topcos
right to pursue a claim against Acquiror for legal relief against assets of
Acquiror held outside the Trust Account (including any assets that have been
purchased or acquired with any funds that have been released from the
Trust Account) or pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ for specific performance
or other injunctive relief.

Section 6.04  _Proxy Statement_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, the Company shall deliver to
Acquiror (i) the Financial Statements and (ii) any other audited or unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and the related audited or unaudited consolidated
statements of comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders equity and cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for a year-to-date period ended
as of the end of any other different fiscal quarter (and as of and for the
same period from the previous fiscal year) or fiscal year, as applicable that
is required to be included in the Proxy Statement. All such financial
statements, together with any audited or unaudited consolidated balance sheet
and the related audited or unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive
(loss) income, stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of and for a year-to-date period ended as of the end of
a different fiscal quarter (and as of and for the same period from the
previous fiscal year) or fiscal year (and as of and for the prior fiscal
quarter) that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement (i) will
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the date thereof, and the results of
its operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the respective periods
then ended (subject, in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments (none of which is expected to
be material) and the absence of 

 



A-46

    

 footnotes), (ii) will be prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved, (iii) in the case of any audited
financial statements, will be audited in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB and contain an unqualified report of the Companys auditor and (iv) will
comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and with the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act in effect as of the respective dates thereof (including
Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable). The Company shall be
available to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable
best efforts to make their officers and employees available to, in each case,
upon reasonable advanced notice, Acquiror and its counsel in connection with
(i) the drafting of the Proxy Statement and (ii) responding in a timely
manner to comments on the Proxy Statement from the SEC. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Acquiror in connection with the preparation for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement of pro forma financial statements that comply with the requirements
of Regulation S-X under the rules and regulations of the SEC (as interpreted
by the staff of the SEC).

(b) From and after the date on which the Proxy Statement is mailed to
Acquirors stockholders, the Company will give Acquiror prompt written notice
of any action taken or not taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries or of any
development regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries, in any such case which
is or becomes known by the Company, that would cause the Proxy Statement to
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _that_ , if any such
action shall be taken or fail to be taken or such development shall otherwise
occur, Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate fully to cause an amendment or
supplement to be made promptly to the Proxy Statement, such that the
Proxy Statement no longer contains an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ ,  _further_ , _however_ , that no information
received by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ shall operate as a
waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or
made by the party who disclosed such information, and no such information
shall be deemed to change, supplement or amend the Schedules.

Section 6.05  _Code_ ___Section_ __ _ 280G_. To the extent that any
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder) has the right to receive any payments
or benefits that could be deemed to constitute "parachute payments" (within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder), then, the Company will: (a) no later than six (6) days prior to
the Closing Date, solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
each such "disqualified individual" a waiver of such disqualified individuals
rights to some or all of such payments or benefits (the " _Waived
280G Benefits_ ") so that any remaining payments and/or benefits shall not be
deemed to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations thereunder); and (b) no later than three (3)
days prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to
the waiver described in clause (a), submit to a vote of holders of the equity
interests of the Company entitled to vote on such matters, in the manner
required under Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, along with adequate disclosure intended to satisfy such
requirements (including QandA 7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such regulations), the
right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the Waived 280G
Benefits. Prior to, and in no event later than four (4) days prior to
soliciting such waivers and approval, the Company shall provide drafts
of such waivers and approval materials to Acquiror for its reasonable review
and comment, and the Company shall consider in good faith any changes
reasonably requested by Acquiror. No later than seven (7) days prior to
soliciting the waivers, the Company shall provide Acquiror with the
calculations and related documentation to determine whether and to what extent
the vote described in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ is necessary in order to
avoid the imposition of Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror evidence that a vote of
the stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
and whether the requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company
was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits or that the vote did not
pass and the Waived 280G Benefits will not be paid or retained.

 



A-47

    

Section 6.06 _FIRPTA_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Acquiror (A) a duly completed and executed certificate dated as of the

Acquiror a fully executed copy of customary pay-off letter(s) relating to the
Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility (which pay-off letter(s)
shall contain a customary statement that all Indebtedness outstanding under
the Credit Facility and all related instruments evidencing such Indebtedness
shall be terminated and all Liens and guarantees in connection therewith
securing such Indebtedness shall be released and terminated) (the " _Pay-off
Letters_") at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing.

Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.08_, on or prior to the Closing, the

terminate, with no further liability thereunder and without any cost or
liability or other obligation to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
all Contracts set forth (or required to be set forth) on _Schedule 4.24_
(including the Management Agreement), provided, that the specific sections of
the Management Agreement set forth on _Schedule 6.08_ that by their terms
survive any termination thereof, solely to the extent that they relate to
indemnification or expense reimbursement for the period prior to the date of
this Agreement, shall survive such termination in accordance with their terms.

 

Section 6.09 _Company Transaction Expenses_. Topco and the Company shall cause
the aggregate amount of Company Transaction Expenses to not exceed,
collectively, the amount set forth in _Schedule 6.10_.

Section 6.10 _R andW Insurance_. Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, prior to the Closing, obtain a buyer-side representations and
warranties insurance policy with respect to the representations and warranties
of the Company, in the name of and for the benefit of Acquiror (the " _R andW
Policy_"), or terms and conditions of such policy reasonably satisfactory to
the Company. The Company and Topco will provide to Acquiror, during the
Interim Period, all assistance as is reasonably required so as to permit the
issuance of such RandW Policy at or prior to the Closing, including the
execution of such no-claims declarations as is reasonably necessary in
connection with the issuance of such RandW Policy; provided, that, (i) any such
no-claims declaration given by an officer of the Company shall only be
required to be given in such individuals, capacity as an officer of the
Company, and not in any individual capacity, (ii) neither Topco nor the
equityholders of Topco will be required to execute any such no-claims
declaration (excluding any such no-claims declaration given by an
equityholder of Topco, who is also an officer of the Company, in accordance
with the foregoing clause (i)), and (iii) Acquiror will use reasonable best
efforts to avoid the requirement and execution of any no-claims declaration.
The RandW Policy shall include a provision whereby the insurer expressly waives,
and agrees not to pursue, directly or indirectly, any rights of or via
subrogation, contribution, or otherwise against Topco or any of its
equityholders or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any claim
made by any insured thereunder (except against such Person to the extent a
claim is paid by the insurer under the RandW Insurance as a direct result of
such Persons Fraud). The Policy shall expressly provide that such Persons are
intended third party beneficiaries of the foregoing provision, with the right
to enforce it. No insured under the RandW Policy shall waive, amend, modify or
otherwise revise such subrogation provision, or allow such provision to be
waived, amended, modified, or otherwise revised.

adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except
as required by Law.

less favorable than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect
to claims existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO

any insurance required to be maintained under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ shall
be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof.

assigns of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation.
In the event that Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each of the Parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as reasonably

that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Acquiror shall promptly inform
the Company of any communication between any Acquiror Party, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, and the Company shall
promptly inform Acquiror of any communication between the Company, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other hand, in either case,
regarding any of the Transactions or any Transaction Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, (a) the Parties agree to request early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and (b) each Party and their
respective Affiliates shall not extend any waiting period, review period or
comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transactions or by the Ancillary
Documents, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror and the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01_ or any other provision of this Agreement obligates any
Party or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, license or otherwise
dispose of, or hold separate and agree to sell, license or otherwise
dispose of, any entities or assets of the Company of its Subsidiaries or any
entity or asset of such Party or any of its Affiliates or any other Person or

Interim Period, the Acquiror Parties, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall give counsel for the Company (in the case of any
Acquiror Party) or Acquiror (in the case of the Company), a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions or the Transaction
Agreements. Each of the Parties agrees not to participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions unless it consults with, in the
case of any Acquiror Party, the Company, or, in the case of the Company,
Acquiror in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Authority, gives, in the case of any Acquiror Party, the Company, or, in the
case of the Company, Acquiror, the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting or discussion.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, (i) in the
event that this _Section_ __ _ 8.01_ conflicts with any other covenant or
agreement in this Agreement that is intended to specifically address any

 



A-52

    

 subject matter, then such other covenant or agreement shall govern and
control solely to the extent of such conflict and (ii) in no event shall
Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear
any expense or pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with
obtaining any consents, authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of
any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) During the Interim Period, Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall each notify the other in writing promptly after learning
of any shareholder demands or other shareholder proceedings (including
derivative claims) relating to this Agreement, any Transaction Agreements or
any matters relating thereto (collectively, the " _Transaction Litigation_ ")
commenced against, in the case of Acquiror, any of the Acquiror Parties or any
of their respective Representatives (in their capacity as a representative of
an Acquiror Party) or, in the case of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any of their respective Representatives (in their capacity as a representative
of an Acquiror Party). Acquiror and the Company shall each (i) keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any Transaction Litigation, (ii) give the other
the opportunity to, at its own cost and expense, participate in the defense,
settlement and compromise of any such Transaction Litigation and reasonably
cooperate with the other in connection with the defense, settlement and
compromise of any such Transaction Litigation, (iii) consider in good faith
the others advice with respect to any such Transaction Litigation and (iv)
reasonably cooperate with each other. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror
and the Company shall jointly control the negotiation, defense and settlement
of any such Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall Acquiror, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, settle or
compromise any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of the
other Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing herein (including this  _Section_ __ _ 8.01_) shall
require the Company or its Subsidiaries to, or to use efforts to, cause, or
attempt to cause, any purchase of any Accordion Shares pursuant to the terms
of any Subscription Agreement of any equityholder of Topco (or any Affiliate
of such equityholder) or Sponsor which is a PIPE Investor, which shall be
exercisable in the sole discretion of such PIPE Investor or Sponsor
(respectively).

 

Section 8.02 _Proxy Statement_ _;_ _Special Meeting_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_.

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, Acquiror shall, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.02(a)_, and the Company will assist Acquiror, and provide to Acquiror all
information regarding the Company, its Affiliates and its business that is
necessary therefor, to prepare and file with the SEC, in preliminary form, a
proxy statement in connection with the Transactions (as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the stockholders of
Acquiror in advance of the Special Meeting, for the purpose of, among other
things: (A) providing Acquirors stockholders with the opportunity to redeem
shares of Acquiror Class A Common Stock by tendering such shares for
redemption not later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
originally scheduled date of the Special Meeting (the " _Acquiror_
_Stockholder Redemption_ "); and (B) soliciting proxies from holders of
Acquiror Class A Common Stock to vote at the Special Meeting, as adjourned or
postponed, in favor of the Acquiror Stockholder Matters. Without the prior
written consent of the Company, the Acquiror Stockholder Matters shall be the
only matters (other than procedural matters) which Acquiror shall propose to
be acted on by the Acquirors stockholders at the Special Meeting, as
adjourned or postponed. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form and
substance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Acquiror shall (I) file the definitive Proxy
Statement with the SEC, (II) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its
stockholders of record, as of the record date to be established by the board
of directors of Acquiror in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)_, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event less than five (5) Business Days
except as otherwise required by applicable Law) following the earlier

 



A-53

    

 to occur of: (x) in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement is not
reviewed by the SEC, the expiration of the waiting period in Rule 14a-6(a)
under the Exchange Act; or (y) in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement
is reviewed by the SEC, receipt of oral or written notification of the
completion of the review by the SEC (such earlier date, the " _Proxy Clearance
Date_ ") and (III) promptly commence a "broker search" in accordance with
Rule 14a-12 of the Exchange Act.

 

(ii) Prior to filing with the SEC, Acquiror will make available to the Company
drafts of the Proxy Statement and any other documents to be filed with the
SEC, both preliminary and final, and any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or such other document and will provide the Company with a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts and shall consider such
comments in good faith. Acquiror shall not file any such documents with the
SEC without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Acquiror will advise the
Company promptly after it receives notice thereof, of: (A) the time when the
Proxy Statement has been filed; (B) in the event the preliminary Proxy
Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, the expiration of the waiting period in
Rule 14a-6(a) under the Exchange Act; (C) in the event the preliminary Proxy
Statement is reviewed by the SEC, receipt of oral or written notification of
the completion of the review by the SEC; (D) the filing of any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement; (E) any request by the SEC for amendment of
the Proxy Statement; (F) any comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy
Statement and responses thereto; and (G) requests by the SEC for additional
information. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any
SEC comments on the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 10 Business Days following receipt by Acquiror of any such
SEC comments except to the extent due to the failure by the Company to timely
provide information required to respond to such SEC comments) and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable; _provided_ , _that_ prior
to responding to any requests or comments from the SEC, Acquiror will make
available to the Company drafts of any such response and provide the Company
with a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts.

(iii) If, at any time prior to the Special Meeting, there shall be discovered
any information that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, Acquiror shall promptly file an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement containing such information. The Company will provide to
Acquiror all information regarding the Company, its Affiliates and its
business that is necessary for any filing contemplated by the immediately
preceding sentence. If, at any time prior to the Closing, the Company
discovers any information, event or circumstance relating to the Company, its
business or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors or employees that
should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then
the Company shall promptly inform Acquiror of such information, event or
circumstance and provide to Acquiror all information necessary to correct any
such deficiencies.

(iv) Acquiror shall make all necessary filings with respect to
the Transactions under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and applicable
"blue sky" laws, and any rules and regulations thereunder. The Company agrees
to promptly provide Acquiror with all information concerning the business,
management, operations and financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case, reasonably requested by Acquiror for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) _Special Meeting_.

 

(i) Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to take, in accordance with
applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and its Organizational Documents, all action
necessary to duly convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Special Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable after the

 



A-54

    

 Proxy Clearance Date (and will commence the mailing of the Proxy to the
Acquiror Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Clearance
Date), to (i) consider and vote upon the approval of the Acquiror Stockholder
Matters and to cause such vote to be taken and (ii) provide Acquiror
Stockholders with the opportunity to elect to effect a Acquiror Share
Redemption. Acquiror may only elect to postpone or adjourn such meeting if
(x) a postponement or adjournment is required by Law, (y) as of the time for
which the Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy)
there are insufficient shares of Acquiror Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) and voting to approve the Acquiror Stockholder Matters or
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special
Meeting or (z) Acquiror determines the payments for the Acquiror Share
Redemption could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions in _
Section_ __ _ 9.01(f)_ to not be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , that
any adjournment or postponement by Acquiror pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (y) or (z) shall require the prior written consent of the Company
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Acquiror shall,
following the Proxy Clearance Date, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Acquiror Stockholder Matters
and in the Proxy Statement the Acquiror Board Recommendation.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding the obligations in Section 8.02(b)(i), at any time prior
to obtaining approval of the Acquiror Stockholder Proposals, solely in
response to an Acquiror Intervening Event, the Acquiror Board may fail to
make, amend, change, withdraw, modify, withhold or qualify the Acquiror Board
Recommendation (any such action, a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") if the
Acquiror Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that, in response to such Acquiror Intervening
Event, a failure to make a Change in Recommendation would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and following such Change in
Recommendation the obligation to solicit proxies in favor of the Acquiror
Stockholder Proposals shall terminate; _provided_ further, that (subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(iii))_ the Acquiror Board will not be entitled to
make, or agree or resolve to make, a Change in Recommendation unless (A)
Acquiror delivers to the Company a written notice (an " _Acquiror Intervening
Event_ _Notice_ ") advising the Company that the Acquiror Board proposes to
take such action and containing the material facts underlying the Acquiror
Boards determination that an Acquiror Intervening Event has occurred, and
(B) at or after 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the fourth (4th) day immediately
following the day on which Acquiror delivered the Acquiror Intervening Event
Notice (such period from the time the Acquiror Intervening Event Notice is
provided until 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the fourth (4th) day immediately
following the day on which Acquiror delivered the Acquiror Intervening Event
Notice (it being understood that any material development with respect to an
Acquiror Intervening Event shall require a new notice but with an additional
three (3) day (instead of four day) period from the date of such notice), the
" _Acquiror Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), the Acquiror Board reaffirms
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make an Acquiror Change in Recommendation would violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If requested by the Company, Acquiror
will and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to, during the Acquiror Intervening Event Notice Period, engage in good faith
negotiations with the Company and its Representatives to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for
an Acquiror Change in Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, a Change in
Recommendation will not affect Acquirors obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02_ (other than as set forth in the first sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.02(b)(ii)_) or elsewhere in this Agreement. Acquiror shall
keep the Company reasonably informed regarding all matters relating to the
Acquiror Stockholder Matters and the Special Meeting, including by promptly
furnishing any voting or proxy solicitation reports received by Acquiror in
respect of such matters and similar updates regarding any redemptions.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(ii)_, the Acquiror Intervening
Event Notice Period will end forty-eight (48) hours prior to the final time
holders of Acquiror Class A Common Stock can tender their shares pursuant to
the Acquiror Stockholder Redemption.

encourage, or provide information to, any Person (other than Acquiror and/or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives) concerning any purchase of any of
the Companys Equity Securities or the issuance and sale of any Equity
Securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any merger or sale
of substantial assets involving the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than

acquisition transaction, but excluding the Transactions, an "

and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the
consummation of the Transactions shall not be deemed a violation of this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ or (ii) any action in connection with a public
offering of any Equity Securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or any Affiliate or successor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or which is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, an Acquisition Transaction.

any of its Affiliates or Representatives to take, whether directly or
indirectly, any action to solicit, initiate, continue or engage in discussions
or negotiations with, or enter into any agreement with, or encourage, respond,
provide information to or commence due diligence with respect to, any Person
(other than the Company, its shareholders and/or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives), concerning, relating to or which is intended or is
reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, any offer, inquiry, proposal
or indication of interest, written or oral relating to any Business
Combination other than with the Company, its shareholders and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives; _provided_ , _that_ , the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the
consummation of the Transactions shall not be deemed a violation of this
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(b)_. Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted prior to the date hereof with respect
to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, a
Business Combination, other than with the Company, its shareholders and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives.

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for purposes of any applicable
state or local income tax that follows the U.S. federal income tax
treatment), each of the Parties intends that the Merger constitute a
transaction that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (collectively, the
" _Intended Income Tax Treatment_ "). The Parties will prepare and file all
Tax Returns consistent with the Intended Income Tax Treatment and will not
take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return or during the course of any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as
otherwise required by a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of
the Code. Each of the Parties agrees to promptly notify all other Parties of
any challenge to the Intended Income Tax Treatment by any Governmental
Authority.

cause to be taken any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably
be expected to prevent the Merger from so qualifying for the Intended Income
Tax Treatment.

 

(c) The Company, Acquiror and Merger Sub hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

Company. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax
that could be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) Acquiror shall take such actions reasonably requested by Topco (including
the issuance of several stock certificates, each describing a portion of the
Closing Share Consideration) to permit Topco to make an "adequate
identification" of the lots of Acquiror Class A Common Stock received pursuant
to this Agreement, including for purposes of Sections 704 and 1012 of
the Code.

Acquiror, as applicable (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except if such announcement or other communication is
required by applicable Law or legal process (including pursuant to the

efforts to coordinate such announcement or communication with the other Party,
prior to announcement or issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
this _Section_ __ _ 8.05_, each Party and its Affiliates may make

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their respective
directors, officers, employees, direct and indirect current or prospective
limited partners and investors or otherwise in the ordinary course of their
respective businesses, in each case, so long as such recipients are obligated
to keep such information confidential without the consent of any other Party;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ and this

as _Exhibit D_ , including using reasonable best efforts to (i) solely in the
case of the Company, maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letters
in the form provided to Acquiror

 concurrently with the execution of this Agreement; (ii) satisfy all of the
conditions precedent to the initial availability of the Debt Financing
applicable to any Party that are within such Partys control; (iii)
negotiate, execute and deliver definitive documents (" _Debt Financing
Documents_ ") that reflect the terms contained in the Commitment Letters
(including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to the
commitments thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions contained in
the Commitment Letters or any related fee letter), in each case, which terms
shall not in any respect expand on the conditions to the funding of
the proceeds from the Debt Financing at the Closing or reduce the aggregate
amount of the proceeds from the Debt Financing available to be funded on the
Closing Date; (iv) solely in the case of the Company, draw the full amount of
the proceeds from the Debt Financing upon satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to initial availability of the Debt Financing to consummate the
transactions set forth herein; and (v) solely in the case of the Company,
enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters. No Party shall, and shall
not permit any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives to, without
the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto, take or fail to take
any action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to
materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters. The Company shall comply with all of
its obligations under the Commitment Letters and each applicable Party shall
comply with all of its obligations under each of the Debt Financing Documents.
The Company shall not permit or consent to any amendment, supplement or
modification to be made to the Commitment Letters without the consent of each
other Party hereto; provided, however, that the Company may (with the prior
written consent of Acquiror, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) amend, supplement or modify the Commitment Letters to add lenders,
agents, co-agents, lead arrangers, arrangers, bookrunners, manager, co-
managers or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letters as
of the date hereof and, in connection therewith, amend the economic and other
arrangements solely with respect to the appointment of such existing and
additional lenders, agents, co-agents, lead arrangers, arrangers,
bookrunners, manager, co-managers or similar entities. The Company and
Acquiror shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, refrain from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the Commitment
Letters or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing.

 

(b) In the event of any notification or communication that any portion of the
Debt Financing may become unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Commitment Letters, the Company and Acquiror shall use their reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange for and obtain
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of any such financing
failure event, alternative debt financing in an aggregate amount not less than
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letters,
unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise (the " _Alternative Financing_
"), from alternative sources reasonably acceptable to each Party hereto on
terms and conditions that are not less favorable to the Company than those set
forth in the Commitment Letter (as determined by each Party hereto), provided
however (i) such Alternative Financing would not involve any conditions to
funding the Debt Financing that are more onerous than the conditions contained
in the Commitment Letters immediately prior to such portion of the Debt
Financing becoming unavailable, (ii) such Alternative Financing would not be
reasonably expected to prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Debt
Financing or such Alternative Financing or the Transactions and (iii) the use
of such reasonable best efforts shall not require or permit the Company to
obtain any indebtedness or equity in levels that are different from those
contemplated by the Commitment Letters without the consent of each Party. It
is further understood and agreed that if the Parties proceed with any
Alternative Debt Financing, the Parties shall be subject to the same
obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in this
Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing. In the event that Alternative
Financing is obtained, the Company shall promptly provide Acquiror with a copy
of the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative Financing
(the " _Alternative Financing Commitment Letters_ "). If applicable, any
reference in this Agreement to "Financing" shall include "Alternative
Financing", any reference to "Commitment Letters" shall include the
"Alternative Financing Commitment Letters" and any references to "Debt
Financing Documents" shall include the definitive documentation relating to
any such Alternative Debt Financing.

 



A-58

    

(c) Each Party hereto shall keep the other Parties hereto fully informed, in
all reasonable detail, of the status of their efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Parties shall give the other Parties hereto prompt written notice (i) of any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result
in breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letters or any other Debt
Financing Document of which any Party becomes aware, (ii) if and when any
Party becomes aware that any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters may not be available to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) of the receipt of any written notice or
other written communication from any Person with respect to any (A) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letters or any other Debt Financing Document, or (B) dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letters or any
other Debt Financing Document relating to the availability of the applicable
Financing, (iv) if for any reason any Party believes in good faith it will not
be able to obtain any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the
manner and from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the Debt
Financing Documents, and (v) of any notice of termination of the Commitment
Letters. The Company shall provide Acquiror, upon reasonable request, with
copies of any Debt Financing Documents and such other information and
documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be reasonably necessary to
allow Acquiror to monitor the progress of such financing activities.

(d) Prior to the Closing, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates to, use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to,
provide, and shall use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives, officers, employees and
advisors, including legal and accounting, to provide, all cooperation

the Debt Financing, (iv) assisting with (A) the due diligence efforts of

for convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This

whole or in part, only by a duly authorized agreement in writing executed by
each of the Parties in the same manner as this Agreement and which makes
reference to this Agreement. The approval of this Agreement by
the stockholders of any of the Parties shall not restrict the ability of the
board of directors (or other body performing similar functions) of any of the
Parties to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01_
or to cause such Party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 11.10_. Notwithstanding anything contained to the

Parties further agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any

A-66

    

 under the Laws governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions
necessary to render the remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and
enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law and, to the extent
necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any
provision contained herein that is held invalid or unenforceable with a valid
and enforceable provision giving effect to the intent of the Parties.

 

Section 11.12 _Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. Any Action based upon,
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the State of
Delaware, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court in any such Action, waives any objection
it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to
convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Action shall be
heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be
deemed to affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner
permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce
judgments obtained in any Action brought pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
11.12_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 11.13 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations
under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions
as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
and thereof, without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.01_, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of the Parties
would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
11.13_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction.

 

Section 11.14 _Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against,
the entities that are expressly named as Parties and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except
to the extent a Party (and then only to the extent of the specific obligations
undertaken by such Party in this Agreement), (a) no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, sponsor, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or representative or
Affiliate of any Party and (b) no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, sponsor, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the
foregoing shall have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) for any one or more of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any one or more of the
Company, Topco, Acquiror or Merger Sub under this Agreement of or for any
claim based on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 11.15 _Nonsurvival_ _of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.
None of the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other
agreements in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any
breach of such representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and other provisions, shall survive the Closing

 



A-67

    

 and shall terminate and expire upon the occurrence of the Effective Time
(and there shall be no liability after the Closing in respect thereof), except
for (a) those covenants and agreements contained herein that by their terms
expressly apply in whole or in part at or after the Closing and then only with
respect to any breaches occurring at or after the Closing, and (b) this
_Article_ __ _ XI_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.15_, in no event shall the foregoing be construed to waive
any claim of the Acquiror or the Company against the Debt Financing Sources
pursuant to the Commitment Letters or the Debt Financing Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereunder.

Section 11.16 _Acknowledgements_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on
behalf of its respective Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives) that: (i) it has conducted its own independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties and projected operations of the other Parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) and has been afforded satisfactory access to
the books and records, facilities and personnel of the other Parties (and
their respective Subsidiaries) for purposes of conducting such investigation;
(ii) the representations and warranties in  _Article_ __ _ IV_ constitute
the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the
representations and warranties in  _Article_ __ _ V_ constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of Acquiror and Merger Sub; (iv)
except for the representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _ IV_ by the
Company and the representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _ V_ by the
Acquiror Parties, none of the Parties or any other Person makes, or has made,
any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to any
Party (or any Partys Subsidiaries), including any implied warranty or
representation as to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a
particular purpose or trade as to any of the assets of the such Party or its
Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied
(including (x) regarding the completeness or accuracy of, or any omission to
state or to disclose, any information, including in the estimates,
projections or forecasts or any other information, document or material
provided to or made available to any Party or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives in certain "data rooms," management presentations or in any
other form in expectation of the Transactions, including meetings, calls or
correspondence with management of any Party (or any Partys Subsidiaries), and
(y) any relating to the future or historical business, condition (financial
or otherwise), results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of any
Party (or its Subsidiaries), or the quality, quantity or condition of any
Partys or its Subsidiaries assets) are specifically disclaimed by all
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries and all other Persons (including
the Representatives and Affiliates of any Party or its Subsidiaries); and (v)
each Party and its respective Affiliates are not relying on any
representations and warranties in connection with the Transactions except the
representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _ IV_ by the Company and the
representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _ V_ by the Acquiror Parties.
The foregoing does not limit any rights of any Party pursuant to any other
Transaction Agreement against any other Party pursuant to such Transaction
Agreement to which it is a party or an express third party beneficiary
thereof. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.16(a)_ shall relieve any Party
of liability in the case of Fraud committed by such Party.

(b) Effective upon Closing, each of the Parties waives, on its own behalf and
on behalf of its respective Affiliates and Representatives, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, Actions and causes
of action it may have against the any other Party or their respective
Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former Affiliates or
Representatives relating to the operation of any Party or their respective
businesses prior to the Closing or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, the Schedules, or the Exhibits to this Agreement, whether arising
under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law,
ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise. Each Party acknowledges and
agrees that it will not assert, institute or maintain any Action, suit,
investigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever, including a counterclaim,
cross-claim, or defense, regardless of the legal or equitable theory under
which such liability or obligation may be sought to be imposed, that makes
any claim contrary to the agreements and covenants set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 11.16_. The foregoing agreements, acknowledgements, disclaimers and
waivers are irrevocable. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 11.16_ shall limit, modify, restrict or operate as a waiver
with respect

 



A-68

    

 to, (i) any rights that any Party may have under any written agreement
entered into in connection with the transactions that are contemplated by this
Agreement, including this Agreement and any other Transaction Agreement or
(ii) any employment, severance, bonus or similar agreement or arrangement
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a current officer or
director that continues to remain in effect following the Closing.

its Subsidiaries or its or their Affiliates or their respective
Representatives to bring or support any person, in any Action, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt
Financing Source Related Parties in any way arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
in any forum other than the federal and New York State courts located in the

remains available, and any appellate court thereof, and each party hereto
irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such Action to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court;

(b) agrees that, except to the extent relating to the interpretation of any
of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of any definitive
agreement governing the Debt Financing that expressly specifies that the
interpretation of such provision shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware), all Actions (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Debt

Debt Financing or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated
thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction;

 

(c) IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT,

Agreement reflecting the foregoing agreements in _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ and
this _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, and such provisions and the definitions of "Debt
Financing Sources" or "Debt Financing Source Related Parties" (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of _Section_ __ _ 11.02_ or any provision of this _Section_ __ _
11.17_ or the definitions of "Debt Financing Sources" or "Debt Financing
Source Related Parties") shall not be amended, supplemented, waived or
otherwise modified in any way materially adverse to the Debt Financing Source
Related Parties without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing

ARTICLE IV

 

 _CAPITAL STOCK_

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 3,300,000,000, of which (i)
3,290,000,000 shares shall be a class designated as Class A common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share (" _Common Stock_ "), and (ii) 10,000,000 shares
shall be a class designated as undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001
per share (" _Preferred_ __ _ Stock_").

 

 _Section_ __ _ 1_. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of any of the Common Stock
or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares of such class thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of
Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL or any successor provision thereof, and no vote
of the holders of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock voting
separately as a class shall be required therefor.

_Section_ __ _ 2_. Subject to all the rights, powers and preferences of the
Preferred Stock and except as provided by law or in this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation (as
defined below): (i) the holders of the Common Stock shall have the exclusive
right to vote for the election of directors of the Corporation and on all
other matters requiring stockholder action, each outstanding share entitling
the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the
stockholders of the Corporation for their vote; provided, however, that,
except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock, as such, shall
not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of Designation) that
alters or changes the powers, preferences, rights or other terms of one or
more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected
series of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, either separately or together
with the holders of one or more other such series, on such amendment pursuant
to this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any
Certificate of Designation) or pursuant to the DGCL; (ii) dividends may be
declared and paid or set apart for payment upon the Common Stock out of any
assets or funds of the Corporation legally available for the payment of
dividends, but only when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation (the " _Board_ ") or any authorized committee thereof; and (iii)
upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, the net assets of the Corporation shall be distributed pro
rata to the holders of the Common Stock.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3_. Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time
in one or more series. The Board, or any authorized committee thereof, is
hereby authorized to provide from time to time by resolution or resolutions
for the creation and issuance, out of the authorized and unissued shares of
Preferred Stock, of one or more series of Preferred Stock by filing a
certificate (a " _Certificate of Designation_ ") pursuant to the DGCL, setting
forth such resolution or resolutions and, with respect to each such series,
establishing the designation of such series and the number of shares to be
included in such series and fixing the terms of such series, the voting powers
(full or limited, or no voting power), preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof, of the shares of each such series.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the rights of
the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the resolution
or resolutions providing for the establishment of any series of Preferred
Stock may, to the extent permitted by law, provide that such series shall be
superior to, rank equally with or be junior to the Preferred Stock of any
other series. The terms, voting powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional and other special rights, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of each series of
Preferred Stock may be different from those of any and all other series at any
time outstanding. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of
Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock), no vote of the holders
of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock shall be a prerequisite to the
issuance of any shares of any series of the Preferred Stock so authorized in
accordance with this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
(including any Certificate of Designation relating to any series of
Preferred Stock). Except as otherwise required by law, holders of

 



B-2

    

 Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate of
Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to
the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the
holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any Certificate
of Designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the
DGCL. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Designation
establishing a series of Preferred Stock, the Board may, by resolution or
resolutions, increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of such
series then outstanding) the number of shares of such series and, if the
number of shares of such series shall be so decreased, the shares
constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the
adoption of the resolution or resolutions originally fixing the number of
shares of such series.

 

ARTICLE V

_BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the
Corporation, it is further provided that: 

_Section_ __ _ 1_. Except as otherwise provided in this Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL, the business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Subject
to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and any special rights of the
holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors, the number of directors which
shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed exclusively by one or more
resolutions adopted from time to time by the Board. Except as otherwise
expressly provided by the bylaws of the Corporation (as the same may be
amended and/or restated from time to time, the " _Bylaws_ ") or delegated by
resolution of the Board, the Board shall have the exclusive power and
authority to appoint and remove officers of the Corporation.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 2_. Other than any directors elected by the separate vote of
the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, if applicable, the
Board shall be and is divided into three classes, designated as Class I, Class
II and Class III, as nearly equal in number as possible. The Board may assign
members of the Board already in office to such classes as of the
effectiveness of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "
_Effective Time_ "). Directors shall be assigned to each class in accordance
with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board. At the first annual
meeting of stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of
the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors elected to succeed
those directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three
years. At the second annual meeting of stockholders following the Effective
Time, the term of office of the Class II directors shall expire and Class II
directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expired shall
be elected for a full term of three years. At the third annual meeting of
stockholders following the Effective Time, the term of office of the Class III
directors shall expire and Class III directors elected to succeed those
directors whose terms expired shall be elected for a full term of three
years. Subject to any special rights of the holders of one or more series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors, at each succeeding annual meeting of
stockholders, directors shall be elected for a full term of three years to
succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.
If the number of such directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be
apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in
each class as nearly equal as possible, and any such additional director of
any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an
increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with
the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the
number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. Any
such director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which his or her
term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified,

that overlap with or compete with those in which the Corporation, directly or
indirectly, may engage, the provisions of this Article IX are set forth to
regulate and define the conduct of certain affairs of the Corporation with
respect to certain classes or categories of business opportunities as they
may involve any of the Principal Stockholder, the CP Sponsor, the Non-Employee

any corporate opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director if such
opportunity is expressly offered to such Person solely in his or her capacity
as a director or officer of the Corporation, and the provisions of Section 2
of this Article IX shall not apply to any such corporate opportunity.

_Section_ __ _ 4_. In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article IX, a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to
be a potential corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business
opportunity that (i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able,
nor contractually permitted, to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the
line of the Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the
Corporation or (iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or
reasonable expectancy, in each case as determined by the Board.

_Section_ __ _ 5_. For purposes of this Article IX, "Affiliate" shall mean
(a) in respect of the Principal Stockholder, any Person that, directly or

Article I - Corporate Offices

 

1.1 _Registered Office_.

 

The address of the registered office of Advantage Solutions Inc. (the "
_Corporation_ ") in the State of Delaware, and the name of its registered
agent at such address, shall be as set forth in the Corporations certificate
of incorporation, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time
(the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ").

 

1.2 _Other Offices_.

The Corporation may have additional offices at any place or places, within or
outside the State of Delaware, as the Corporations board of directors (the "
_Board_ ") may from time to time establish or as the business of
the Corporation may require.

Article II - Meetings of Stockholders

 

2.1 _Place of Meetings_.

 

Meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place, if any, within or
outside the State of Delaware, designated by the Board. The Board may, in its
sole discretion, determine that a meeting of stockholders shall not be held at
any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as
authorized by Section 211(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "). In the absence of any such designation or
determination, stockholders meetings shall be held at the Corporations
principal executive office.

 

2.2 _Annual Meeting_.

The Board shall designate the date and time of the annual meeting. At the
annual meeting, directors shall be elected and other proper business properly
brought before the meeting in accordance with Section 2.4 may be transacted.
The Board may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of
stockholders previously scheduled by the Board.

2.3 _Special Meeting_ _s_.

Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by such Persons and
only in such manner as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.

No business may be transacted at any special meeting of stockholders other
than the business specified in the notice of such meeting.

2.4 _Advance Notice Procedures_ _for Business Brought before a Meeting_.

 

(i) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be

 



A-75

    

 (a) specified in a notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the
Board, (b) if not specified in a notice of meeting, otherwise brought before
the meeting by the Board or the chairperson of the meeting, or (c) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder present in Person who (A)
(1) was a stockholder of record of the Corporation both at the time of giving
the notice provided for in this Section 2.4 and at the time of the meeting,
(2) is entitled to vote at the meeting and (3) has complied with this Section
2.4 or (B) properly made such proposal in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under
the Exchange Act, which proposal has been included in the proxy statement for
the annual meeting. The foregoing clause (c) shall be the exclusive means for
a stockholder to propose business to be brought before an annual meeting of
the stockholders. The only matters that may be brought before a special
meeting are the matters specified in the Corporations notice of meeting given
by or at the direction of the Person calling the meeting pursuant to the
Certificate of Incorporation and Section 2.3 of these bylaws. For purposes of
this Section 2.4 and Section 2.5 of these bylaws, "present in Person" shall
mean that the stockholder proposing that the business be brought before the
annual or special meeting of the Corporation, or, if the proposing stockholder
is not an individual, a qualified representative of such proposing
stockholder, shall appear at such annual meeting, and a
"qualified representative" of such proposing stockholder shall be, if such
proposing stockholder is (x) a general or limited partnership, any general
partner or Person who functions as a general partner of the general or limited
partnership or who controls the general or limited partnership, (y) a
corporation or a limited liability company, any officer or Person who
functions as an officer of the corporation or limited liability company or any
officer, director, general partner or Person who functions as an officer,
director or general partner of any entity ultimately in control of the
corporation or limited liability company or (z) a trust, any trustee of such
trust. This Section 2.4 shall apply to any business that may be brought
before an annual or special meeting of stockholders other than nominations for
election to the Board at an annual meeting, which shall be governed by Section
2.5 of these bylaws. Stockholders seeking to nominate Persons for election to
the Board must comply with Section 2.5 of these bylaws, and this Section 2.4
shall not be applicable to nominations for election to the Board except as
expressly provided in Section 2.5 of these bylaws.

 

(ii) Without qualification, for business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must (a) provide Timely
Notice (as defined below) thereof in writing and in proper form to the
secretary of the Corporation and (b) provide any updates or supplements to
such notice at the times and in the forms required by this Section 2.4. To be
timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received
at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety
(90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the one-year
anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or
more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered, or mailed and received, not
later than the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or, if later,
the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public disclosure of the date
of such annual meeting was first made (such notice within such time periods, "
_Timely Notice_ "). In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an
annual meeting or the announcement thereof commence a new time period for the
giving of Timely Notice as described above.

(iii) To be in proper form for purposes of this Section 2.4, a stockholders
notice to the secretary shall set forth:

(a) As to each Proposing Person (as defined below), (A) the name and address
of such Proposing Person (including, if applicable, the name and address that
appear on the Corporations books and records); and (B) the number of shares
of each class or series of stock of the Corporation that are, directly or
indirectly, owned of record or beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by such Proposing Person, except that such
Proposing Person shall in all events be deemed to beneficially own any shares
of any class or series of stock of the Corporation as to which such Proposing
Person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time in the future
(the disclosures to be made pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) are
referred to as " _Stockholder Information_ ");

 



A-76

    

(b) As to each Proposing Person, (A) the full notional amount of
any securities that, directly or indirectly, underlie any "derivative
security" (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act)
that constitutes a "call equivalent position" (as such term is defined in
Rule 16a-1(b) under the Exchange Act) (" _Synthetic Equity Position_ ") and
that is, directly or indirectly, held or maintained by such Proposing Person
with respect to any shares of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation; _provided_ that, for the purposes of the definition of "Synthetic
Equity Position," the term "derivative security" shall also include any
security or instrument that would not otherwise constitute a "derivative
security" as a result of any feature that would make any conversion, exercise
or similar right or privilege of such security or instrument becoming
determinable only at some future date or upon the happening of a future
occurrence, in which case the determination of the amount of securities into
which such security or instrument would be convertible or exercisable shall be
made assuming that such security or instrument is immediately convertible or
exercisable at the time of such determination; and, _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any Proposing Person satisfying the requirements of Rule 13d-1(b)(1)
under the Exchange Act (other than a Proposing Person that so satisfies Rule
13d-1(b)(1) under the Exchange Act solely by reason of Rule
13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(E)) shall not be deemed to hold or maintain the notional
amount of any securities that underlie a Synthetic Equity Position held by
such Proposing Person as a hedge with respect to a bona fide derivatives trade
or position of such Proposing Person arising in the ordinary course of such
Proposing Persons business as a derivatives dealer, (B) any rights to
dividends on the shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation
owned beneficially by such Proposing Person that are separated or separable
from the underlying shares of the Corporation, (C) any material pending or
threatened legal proceeding in which such Proposing Person is a party or
material participant involving the Corporation or any of its officers or
directors, or any affiliate of the Corporation, (D) any other material
relationship between such Proposing Person, on the one hand, and the
Corporation or any affiliate of the Corporation, on the other hand, (E) any
direct or indirect material interest in any material contract or agreement of
such Proposing Person with the Corporation or any affiliate of the Corporation
(including, in any such case, any employment agreement, collective bargaining
agreement or consulting agreement) and (F) any other information relating to
such Proposing Person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy
statement or other filing required to be made in connection with solicitations
of proxies or consents by such Proposing Person in support of the business
proposed to be brought before the meeting pursuant to Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act (the disclosures to be made pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A)
through (F) are referred to as " _Disclosable Interests_ "); _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Disclosable Interests shall not include any such disclosures
with respect to the ordinary course business activities of any broker, dealer,
commercial bank, trust company or other nominee who is a Proposing Person
solely as a result of being the stockholder directed to prepare and submit
the notice required by these bylaws on behalf of a beneficial owner; and

 

(c) As to each item of business that the Proposing Person proposes to bring
before the annual meeting, (A) a brief description of the business desired to
be brought before the annual meeting, the reasons for conducting such business
at the annual meeting and any material interest in such business of each
Proposing Person, (B) the text of the proposal or business (including the
text of any resolutions proposed for consideration), (C) a reasonably detailed
description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings (x) between or
among any of the Proposing Persons or (y) between or among any Proposing
Person and any other Person or entity (including their names) in connection
with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and (D) any other
information relating to such item of business that would be required to
be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies in support of the business proposed
to be brought before the meeting pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange
Act; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the disclosures required by this Section
2.4(iii) shall not include any disclosures with respect to any broker, dealer,
commercial bank, trust company or other nominee who is a Proposing Person
solely as a result of being the stockholder directed to prepare and submit
the notice required by these bylaws on behalf of a beneficial owner.

 



A-77

(v) A Proposing Person shall update and supplement its notice to the

eight (8) business days prior to the date for the meeting or, if practicable,
any adjournment or postponement thereof (and, if not practicable, on the first
practicable date prior to the date to which the meeting has been adjourned or
postponed) (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made
as of ten (10) business days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof).

(vi) Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary, no business
shall be conducted at an annual meeting that is not properly brought before
the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.4. The presiding officer of the
meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that the business was not
properly brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.4, and
if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the meeting
and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be
transacted.

(vii) In addition to the requirements of this Section 2.4 with respect to any
business proposed to be brought before an annual meeting, each Proposing
Person shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act with

(iii) if electronically transmitted, as provided in Section 8.1 of these
bylaws.

 

An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the Corporation or
of the transfer agent or any other agent of the Corporation that the notice
has been given by mail or by a form of electronic transmission, as applicable,
shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein.

2.8 _Quorum_.

 

Unless otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
bylaws, the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote, present in Person, or by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at all meetings of the stockholders.
If, however, a quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the
stockholders, then either (i) the chairperson of the meeting or (ii) a
majority in voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting,
present in Person, or by remote communication, if applicable, or represented
by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time in the
manner provided in Section 2.9 of these bylaws until a quorum is present or
represented.

 

2.9 _Adjourned Meeting; Notice_.

 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, further notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time, place, if any, and
the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy
holders may be deemed to be present in Person and vote at such adjourned
meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At any
adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have
been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the
adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to
vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix as the record
date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned
meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice
of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date
so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.

2.10 _Conduct of Business_.

 

The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter
upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the
meeting by the Person presiding over the meeting. The Board may adopt by
resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent
with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the chairperson of
any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and
(for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such
rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment
of such chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.
Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or
prescribed by the chairperson of the meeting, may include, without
limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of
business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at
the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance
at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other Persons
as the chairperson of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on
entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and
(v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.
Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the chairperson of the
meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in
accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

2.11 _Voting_.

 

Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, these
bylaws or the DGCL, each stockholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for
each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.

Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, at all duly
called or convened meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, for
the election of directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient
to elect a director. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate
of Incorporation, these bylaws, the

 



A-81

    

 rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or
applicable law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or
its securities, each other matter presented to the stockholders at a duly
called or convened meeting at which a quorum is present shall be decided by
the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast (excluding abstentions
and broker non-votes) on such matter.

2.12 _Record Date for Stockholder Meetings and Other Purposes_.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less
than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board so fixes a
date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it
fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the
meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date is
fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be the close of
business on the next day preceding the day on which notice is first given, or,
if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the
day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a
new record date for the adjourned meeting; and in such case shall also fix as
the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to vote in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment or any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, or for the purposes of any
other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior to
such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

2.13 _Proxies_.

 

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another Person or Persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by
an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in
accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but, no such proxy
shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless
the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that
states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions
of Section 212 of the DGCL. A proxy may be in the form of a telegram,
cablegram or other means of electronic transmission which sets forth or is
submitted with information from which it can be determined that the telegram,
cablegram or other means of electronic transmission was authorized by the
stockholder.

 

2.14 _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_.

 

The Corporation shall prepare, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting (provided, however, that if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date of
the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of
the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and
showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in
the name of each stockholder. The Corporation shall not be required to include
electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such
list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any
purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to
the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic

 



A-82

    

 network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the Corporations principal executive office. In the event that the
Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network,
the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be
held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by
any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means
of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination
of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such
list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. Such list shall
presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at
the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them. Except as otherwise
provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are
the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this
Section 2.14 or to vote in Person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 

2.15 _Inspectors of Election_.

 

Before any meeting of stockholders, the Corporation shall appoint an inspector
or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment and make a
written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more Persons as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If any Person
appointed as inspector or any alternate fails to appear or fails or refuses
to act, then the chairperson of the meeting shall appoint a Person to fill
that vacancy.

Such inspectors shall:

 

(i) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each,
the number of shares represented at the meeting and the validity of any
proxies and ballots;

(ii) count all votes or ballots;

 

(iii) count and tabulate all votes;

 

(iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition
of any challenges made to any determination by the inspector(s); and

(v) certify its or their determination of the number of shares represented at
the meeting and its or their count of all votes and ballots.

Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspection
with strict impartiality and according to the best of such inspectors
ability. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is prima
facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The inspectors of election may
appoint such Persons to assist them in performing their duties as they
determine.

Section 2.17. _Delivery to the Corporation_. Whenever this Article II
requires one or more Persons (including a record or beneficial owner of stock)
to deliver a document or information to the Corporation or any officer,
employee or agent thereof (including any notice, request, questionnaire,
revocation, representation or other document or agreement), unless the
Corporation elects otherwise, such document or information shall be in writing
exclusively (and not in an electronic transmission) and shall be
delivered exclusively by hand (including, without limitation, overnight
courier service) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested,
and the Corporation shall not be required to accept delivery of any document
not in such written form or so delivered.

Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Stockholders Agreement,

before that directors term of office expires.

 

3.3 _Election, Qualification and Term of Office of Directors_.

 

Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, each director, including a
director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship, shall hold

Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or by
electronic transmission to the Corporation. The resignation shall take effect
at the time specified therein or upon the happening of an event specified
therein, and if no time or event is specified, at the time of its receipt.
When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a
future date or upon the happening of an event to occur on a future date, a
majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so
resigned, shall (subject to the Stockholders Agreement) have power to fill
such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such
resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so
chosen shall hold office as provided in this Section 3.4 in the filling of
other vacancies.

 

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws
or in the Stockholders Agreement, vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors shall be
filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than
a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director appointed in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of

the Board shall be deemed to exist under these bylaws in the case of the
death, removal or resignation of any director.

bylaws, members of the Board, or any committee designated by the Board, may
participate in a meeting of the Board, or any committee, by means of
conference telephone or other communications equipment through which all
Persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such
participation in a meeting pursuant to this bylaw shall constitute presence
in Person at the meeting.

3.6 _Regular Meetings_.

 

Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and at
such place as shall from time to time be determined by the Board. 

 



A-84

not specify the place of the meeting (if the meeting is to be held at
the Corporations principal executive office) nor the purpose of the meeting.

3.8 _Quorum_.

 

At all meetings of the Board, a majority of the total number of directors
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a
majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present
shall be the act of the Board, except as may be otherwise specifically
provided by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws. If a
quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board, then the directors present
thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than
announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.

 

A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact
business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is
approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.

3.9 _Board Action by Written Consent without a Meeting_.

Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these
bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the
Board, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all
members of the Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in
writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or
electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
proceedings of the Board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if
the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if
the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

Subject to the Stockholders Agreement, the Board may designate one (1) or more
committees, each committee to consist, of one (1) or more of the directors of
the Corporation. The Board may designate one (1) or more directors as

member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of
a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members
constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board or
in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of

representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it

theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new
certificate or uncertificated shares.

 



A-88

    

7.4 _Shares Without Certificates_

its shares of stock by electronic or other means not involving the issuance
of certificates, provided the use of such system by the Corporation is
permitted in accordance with applicable law.

7.5  _Construction; Definitions_.

Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of
construction and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction of
these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular

7.6 _Dividends_.

The Board, subject to any restrictions contained in either (i) the DGCL or
(ii) the Certificate of Incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the

delivery of duly executed instructions with respect to uncertificated shares),
with such evidence of the authenticity of such endorsement or execution,
transfer, authorization and other matters as the Corporation may reasonably
require, and accompanied by all necessary stock transfer stamps. No transfer
of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it
shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry
showing the names of the Persons from and to whom it was transferred.

7.10 _Stock Transfer Agreements_.

The Corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with
any number of stockholders of any one or more classes or series of stock of
the Corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation
of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not
prohibited by the DGCL.

 



A-89

    

7.11 _Registered Stockholders_.

 

The Corporation:

(i) shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a Person registered
on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such
owner; and

interest in such share or shares on the part of another Person, whether or
not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.

7.12  _Waiver of Notice_.

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the
Person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the
Person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for
which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance
of a Person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except when the Person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting
at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because
the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting need be
specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic
transmission unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these
bylaws.

Article VIII - Notice by Electronic Transmission

 

8.1 _Notice by Electronic Transmission_.

 

Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively
to stockholders pursuant to the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws shall
be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by
the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be
revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation. Any such
consent shall be deemed revoked if:

 

(i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two (2)
consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent;
and

(ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary
of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other Person responsible for
the giving of notice.

However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall
not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Corporation may give notice by electronic mail in
accordance with Section 232 of the DGCL without obtaining the consent required
by this Section 8.1.

Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:

 



     | (i) |

if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the
stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and
(B) the giving of such separate notice; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the
stockholder. 

---|---|--- 
 



A-90

    

An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer
agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has been given by a
form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein.

 

8.2 _Definition of Electronic Transmission_.

 

An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly
involving the physical transmission of paper, including the use of, or
participation in, one or more electronic networks or databases (including one
or more distributed electronic networks or databases), that creates a record
that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and
that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an
automated process.

Article IX - Indemnification

 

9.1 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any
director or officer of the Corporation who was or is made or is threatened to
be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ ")
by reason of the fact that he or she, or a Person for whom he or she is the
legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or,
while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or
non-profit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys
fees, judgments, fines ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred by such Person in connection with any such
Proceeding. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in Section 9.4 of these bylaws, the Corporation shall be required to
indemnify a Person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such Person
only if the Proceeding was authorized in the specific case by the Board.

9.2 _Indemnification of Others_.

 

The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may
hereafter be amended, any employee or agent of the Corporation who was or is
made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any
Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she, or a Person for whom he or
she is the legal representative, is or was an employee or agent of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit entity, including
service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses reasonably incurred by such Person in connection with
any such Proceeding.

 

9.3 _Prepayment of Expenses_.

 

The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law
pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by any officer or
director of the Corporation, and may pay the expenses incurred by any employee
or agent of the Corporation, in defending any Proceeding in advance of its
final disposition; _provided, however_ , that, to the extent required by
law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the
Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Person to
repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the
Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article IX or otherwise.

 



A-91

    

9.4 _Determination; Claim_.

 

If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such
Proceeding) under this Article IX is not paid in full within sixty (60) days,
or a claim for advancement of expenses under this Article IX is not paid in
full within thirty (30) days, after a written claim therefor has been received
by the Corporation the claimant may thereafter (but not before) file suit to
recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in
part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to
the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall
have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the
requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law.

9.5 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_.

The rights conferred on any Person by this Article IX shall not be exclusive
of any other rights which such Person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, these bylaws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

9.6 _Insurance_.

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any Person
who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
enterprise or non-profit entity against any liability asserted against him or
her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to
indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

 

9.7 _Other Indemnificatio_ _n_.

 

The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify or advance expenses to any
Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise
or non-profit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Person may collect as
indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit enterprise.

 

9.8 _Continuation of Indemnification_.

 

The rights to indemnification and to prepayment of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article IX shall continue notwithstanding that the
Person has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall
inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees
and distributees of such Person.

 

9.9 _Amendment or Repeal_ _; Interpretation_.

 

The provisions of this Article IX shall constitute a contract between the
Corporation, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, each individual who
serves or has served as a director or officer of the Corporation (whether
before or after the adoption of these bylaws), in consideration of such
Persons performance of such services, and pursuant to this Article IX
the Corporation intends to be legally bound to each such current or former
director or officer of the Corporation. With respect to current and former
directors and officers of the Corporation, the rights conferred under this
Article IX are present contractual rights and such rights are fully vested,
and shall be deemed to have vested fully, immediately upon adoption of theses
bylaws. With respect to any directors or officers of the Corporation who
commence service following adoption of these bylaws, the rights conferred
under this provision shall be present contractual rights and such rights shall
fully vest, and be deemed to have vested fully, immediately upon such director
or officer commencing service as a director or officer of the Corporation.
Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article IX
shall not adversely affect

 



A-92

    

 any right or protection (i) hereunder of any Person in respect of any act or
omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification or (ii)
under any agreement providing for indemnification or advancement of expenses
to an officer or director of the Corporation in effect prior to the time of
such repeal or modification.

 

Any reference to an officer of the Corporation in this Article IX shall be
deemed to refer exclusively to the chairperson of the Board, a
vice chairperson of the Board, a chief executive officer, a chief financial
officer, a secretary, a treasurer appointed pursuant to Article V of these
bylaws and to any vice president, assistant secretary, assistant treasurer or
other officer of the Corporation appointed by (x) the Board pursuant to
Article V of these Bylaws or (y) an officer to whom the Board has delegated
the power to appoint officers pursuant to Article V of these bylaws, and any
reference to an officer of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall be deemed to refer
exclusively to an officer appointed by the board of directors (or equivalent
governing body) of such other entity pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of such
other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or
other enterprise. The fact that any Person who is or was an employee of
the Corporation or an employee of any other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise has been given or
has used the title of "vice president" or any other title that could be
construed to suggest or imply that such Person is or may be an officer of the
Corporation or of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise shall not result in such Person
being constituted as, or being deemed to be, an officer of the Corporation or
of such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise for purposes of this Article IX.

 

Article X - Amendments

 

The Board is expressly empowered to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws of the
Corporation. The stockholders also shall have power to adopt, amend or repeal
the bylaws of the Corporation; _provided, however_ , that, in addition to any
vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation
required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, such action
by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
66 2/3% of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock
of the Corporation with the power to vote at an election of directors, voting
together as a single class.

Article XI - Forum Selection

 

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, (a) the Court of Chancery (the " _Chancery Court_ ") of the State of
Delaware (or, in the event that the Chancery Court does not have jurisdiction,
the federal district court for the District of Delaware or, in the event that
the federal district court for the District of Delaware does not have
jurisdiction, other state courts of the State of Delaware) shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any
derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the
Corporation, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach
of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder of the
Corporation to the Corporation or to the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any
action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or
the Certificate of Incorporation or these bylaws (as either may be amended
from time to time) or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim
against the Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b)
subject to the preceding provisions of this Article XI, the federal district
courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the
resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If any action the subject matter of which
is within the scope of clause (a) of the immediately preceding sentence is
filed in a court other than the courts in the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to
have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts in the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any
such court to enforce the provisions of clause (a) of the immediately
preceding sentence and (y) having service of process made upon such
stockholder in any such action by service upon such stockholders counsel in
the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

 



A-93

    

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any
security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented
to this Article XI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Article XI shall not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty
created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other
claim for which the federal courts of the United States have exclusive
jurisdiction.

Article XII - Interpretation

For as long as the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect, in the event of

contained in the Stockholders Agreement, the terms and provisions of the

The Facilities will contain the terms set forth on the Term Sheets (including

   2. |

__Titles and Roles__ _._ 

---|--- 
 

Each of BofA Securities, MSSF and DBSI (in each case acting alone or through
or with affiliates selected by it) will act as a lead arranger
and bookrunning manager for each of the Facilities (together in such
capacities, and together with each Additional Committing Lender pursuant to
this Section 2, collectively the " _Lead Arrangers_ ", and each a "

").

 

You will have the right (the " _Designation Right_ "), on or prior to the date
that is fifteen (15) business days after the date of your acceptance of this
Commitment Letter, in your sole discretion, to appoint one or more entities
(with affiliated entities being treated as a single entity) as an Initial
Lender, additional agent, co-agent, lead arranger, arranger, bookrunner,
manager or co-manager and to confer other titles in respect of any Facility on
any such entity (any such agent, co-agent, lead arranger, arranger,
bookrunner, manager, co-manager or holder of another title, an " _Additional
Committing Lender_ ") in addition to the Commitment Party that is a party to
this Commitment Letter on the date hereof, in a manner and with economics
determined by you. If you appoint one or more Additional Committing Lenders
with respect to a Facility:

 



     | (a) |

the commitments of each Initial Lender immediately prior to such appointment
with respect to any such portion of such Facility will be reduced on a _pro
rata_ basis; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

the economics allocated to the Initial Lenders immediately prior to such
exercise of Designation Rights in respect of such Facility will be reduced in
proportion to such reductions in commitments upon the execution by such
Additional Committing Lender of joinder documentation or an amendment to the
Commitment Papers reasonably acceptable to you that adds such Additional
Committing Lender as a "Commitment Party" and an "Initial Lender" thereunder
with respect to such Facility. 

---|---|--- 
 

Thereafter, each such Additional Committing Lender will constitute a
"Commitment Party" and an "Initial Lender" under the Commitment Papers. In
connection with your exercise of Designation Rights (i) fees will be allocated
to each Additional Committing Lender on a _pro rata_ basis in respect of the
commitments it is assuming with respect to a Facility or on such other basis
as you and the Initial Lenders then party to the Commitment Papers may agree,
(ii) no Additional Committing Lender shall receive greater economics in
respect to such Facility than the Commitment Parties first a party to this
Commitment Letter prior to the date of your acceptance of this Commitment
Letter and (iii) in no event will the economics allocated to all such
Additional Committing Lenders exceed 20% of the aggregate economics in respect
of such Facility (exclusive of any fees payable to an administrative agent or
collateral agent in its capacity as such). We agree to execute such
documentation as you may reasonably request, including joinder agreements and
amendments to the Commitment Papers in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to you and us, in connection with your execution of any
Designation Rights.

It is further agreed that (i) BofA Securities will appear on the top left of
the cover page of all marketing materials for the First Lien Term Facility and
will hold the roles and responsibilities conventionally understood 

 



A-99

    

 to be associated with such name placement and (ii) BofA Securities will
appear on the top left of the cover page of all marketing materials for the
ABL Facility and will hold the roles and responsibilities conventionally
understood to be associated with such name placement.

Other than as provided above, no other agents, co-agents, lead arrangers, co-
arrangers, bookrunners, managers or co-managers will be appointed, no other
titles will be awarded and no compensation to any of the foregoing or any
Initial Lender (other than compensation expressly contemplated by the
Commitment Papers) will be paid in order to obtain a commitment to participate
in or otherwise in connection with any Facility unless you and we agree.



   3. |

__Syndication__ _._ 

---|--- 
 

The Lead Arrangers reserve the right, prior to or after the execution of the
Facilities Documentation, to syndicate all or a portion of the commitments
with respect to the First Lien Term Facility and the ABL Facility
(collectively, the " _Syndicated Facilities_ ", and each a " _Syndicated
Facility_ ") to a group of banks, financial institutions and
other institutional lenders that are identified by such Lead Arrangers and
subject to your prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (together with the Initial Lenders, the " _Lenders_ ").
The Lead Arrangers will syndicate the Syndicated Facilities to those banks,
financial institutions, other institutional lenders and other persons
identified by you in writing that agree to join the syndicate (collectively,
the " _Relationship Lenders_ "). The Lead Arrangers will not syndicate to the
following entities (collectively, the " _Disqualified Lenders_ "):



     | (a) |

those entities identified by or on behalf of you in writing, from time to
time, as competitors of the Acquired Business; 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

any persons that are engaged as principals primarily in private equity,
mezzanine financing or venture capital (other than a _bona fide_ debt fund
affiliate of any of the Commitment Parties) and those banks, financial
institutions, other institutional lenders and other persons that are, in each
case, identified in writing by or on behalf of you to us on or prior to the
date hereof; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

any person that is (or becomes) an affiliate of the entities described in the
preceding clauses (a) and (b) (other than, with respect to clause (a), any
_bona fide_ debt fund affiliates thereof (except to the extent separately
identified under clause (a) or (b) above)); _provided_ that such person is
either reasonably identifiable as an affiliate on the basis of its name or is
identified in writing to us by or on behalf of you. 

---|---|--- 

No Disqualified Lender may become a Lender or have any commitment or right
(including a participation right) with respect to any Facility; _provided_
that, to the extent persons are identified as Disqualified Lenders in writing
by you after the date of this Commitment Letter (or, if after the Closing
Date, by you to the applicable Administrative Agent) pursuant to clauses (a)
or (c) above, the inclusion of such persons as Disqualified Lenders shall not
retroactively apply to prior assignments or participations made in compliance
with applicable assignment or participation provisions; _provided_ that you
will have "yank a bank" rights with respect to any Lender that becomes a
Disqualified Lender after an assignment or participation of Loans to it.
Notwithstanding the Lead Arrangers right to syndicate the Syndicated
Facilities and receive commitments with respect thereto, except in connection
with your exercise of the Designation Rights, (i) no Initial Lender will be
relieved, released or novated from its obligations under the Commitment Papers
in connection with any syndication, assignment or participation of a Facility,
including its commitments and obligations to fund such Facility, until
after the initial funding under such Facility has occurred (or, with respect
to the ABL Facility, if there is no funding of the ABL Facility on the Closing
Date, the date of the effectiveness of the ABL Facility), (ii) no assignment
or novation will become effective (as between you and the Initial Lenders)
with respect to all or any portion of the Initial Lenders commitments in
respect of a Facility until the initial funding of such Facility has occurred
(or, with respect to the ABL Facility, if there is no funding of the ABL
Facility on the Closing Date, the date of the effectiveness of the ABL
Facility) and (iii) unless you otherwise expressly agree in writing, the
Initial Lenders 

 



A-100

    

 will retain exclusive control over all rights and obligations with respect
to their commitments in respect of each Facility, including all rights with
respect to consents, modifications, supplements, waivers and amendments,
until the initial funding under such Facility has occurred (or, with respect
to the ABL Facility, if there is no funding of the ABL Facility on the Closing
Date, the date of the effectiveness of the ABL Facility).

Each Lead Arranger intends to commence syndication efforts promptly upon the
execution of this Commitment Letter and, as part of its syndication efforts,
it is such Lead Arrangers intent to have Lenders commit to the Syndicated
Facilities prior to the Closing Date. You agree to use your commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Lead Arrangers in completing a Successful
Syndication (as defined in the Fee Letter) until the date that is the earlier
of (a) 30 days after the Closing Date and (b) the date on which a Successful
Syndication is achieved (such earlier date, the " _Syndication Date_ "). Such
assistance shall be limited to the following, upon request:



     | (i) |

your using your commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any syndication
efforts benefit from your existing lending and investment banking
relationships, the existing lending and investment banking relationships of
Leonard Green and Partners, L.P., CVC Capital Partners Limited, Bain Capital,
L.P., and/or any affiliates of each (collectively, together with any
investment funds controlled or advised by the foregoing entities, the "
_Sponsors_ "); 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

direct contact between your senior management and the proposed Lenders at
times and locations to be mutually agreed upon; 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

you agree to ensure that there will not be any competing issuances of your or
Holdings and your or its respective subsidiaries debt securities or your or
Holdings and your and its respective subsidiaries commercial bank or other
credit facilities (and to use your commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that there will not be any such competing issues or facilities of the Buyer,

the Buyer to provide) to the Lead Arrangers all customary information
reasonably available to you with respect to (i) the Acquired Business, (ii)

customarily included in a "private side" bank book (such projections,
together with financial estimates, forecasts and other forward-looking

privilege that may be asserted by, the Acquired Business or any of its

decision not to provide such information.

Section 3, will constitute a condition to the commitments of the Initial
Lenders hereunder. Your obligations under the Commitment Papers to use
"commercially reasonable efforts" to take any action shall not require any of
your affiliates to make any equity contribution in excess of the Minimum
Equity Contribution (as defined in the Fee Letter) or to incur any fee not

(a) decisions as to the selection of institutions to be approached, which will
include Relationship Lenders, if any, and exclude Disqualified Lenders, (b)
subject to your prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), when they will be approached, (c) when their commitments
will be accepted, (d) which institutions will participate (which will include
Relationship Lenders, if any, and exclude Disqualified Lenders), (e) subject
to your prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), the allocation of the commitments among the Lenders and (f) the

__Information__ _._ 

---|--- 
 

You hereby represent that (a) all written information and written data (other
than the Projections and information of a general economic or industry nature
(the " _Information_ ")) that have been or will be made available to the
Commitment Parties by or on behalf of you or the Sponsors, when taken as a
whole, is correct in all material respects and does not or will not, when
furnished, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
materially misleading in light of the circumstances under which such
statements are made (after giving effect to all supplements and updates
thereto) and (b) the Projections that have been or will be made available to
the Lead Arrangers by or on

 



A-102

    

 behalf of you or the Sponsors, when taken as a whole, have been or will be
prepared, when furnished, in good faith based upon assumptions that are
believed by you to be reasonable at the time made and at the time any such
Projections are delivered to the Lead Arrangers; it being understood that (1)
Projections are not to be viewed as facts, (2) Projections are subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the
control of the Acquired Business or the Sponsors, (3) no assurance can be
given that any particular Projections will be realized and (4) actual results
may differ and such differences may be material. You agree that, if at any
time prior to the later of the Closing Date and the Syndication Date, you
become aware that any of the representations in the preceding sentence would
be incorrect in any material respect if the Information and Projections were
being furnished, and such representations were being made, at such time, then
you will supplement the Information and the Projections so that such
representations will be correct in all material respects under those
circumstances. In arranging and syndicating the Syndicated Facilities, the
Lead Arrangers will be entitled to use and rely on the Information and the
Projections without responsibility for independent verification thereof, and
the Lead Arrangers do not assume responsibility for the accuracy or
completeness of the Information or Projections. For the avoidance of doubt,
the accuracy of the representations set forth above is not a condition
precedent to the commitments hereunder or the funding of the Facilities on the
Closing Date.

You acknowledge that (a) we may make available the Information and the
Projections to a proposed syndicate of Lenders (other than Disqualified
Lenders) by posting the Information or the Projections on IntraLinks or
another similar electronic system (the " _Platform_ "), in each case, subject
to a market standard "click through" or similar confidentiality agreement,
and (b) certain Lenders (each, a " _Public Lender_ ") may not wish to receive
information with respect to the Acquired Business or its securities that is
not publicly available or has not been made (or would not be expected to be
made) available to investors in connection with a Rule 144A or public offering
of the Companys securities (" _material non-public information_"). At the
request of the Lead Arrangers, you agree to use your commercially reasonable
efforts to assist us in preparing an additional version of the Confidential
Information Memorandum (the public-side version) to be used by Public Lenders,
that will include no material non-public information with respect to you,
Holdings, the Acquired Business or your or their respective subsidiaries or
your and their respective securities for purposes of United States federal
and state securities laws. It is understood that in connection with the
assistance described above, (i) to the extent reasonably requested by the Lead
Arrangers, you agree to deliver a customary authorization letter to be
included in each Confidential Information Memorandum ( _provided_ , that the
customary "10b-5" representation in such authorization letter will be
consistent with the representations set forth in the preceding paragraph of
this Commitment Letter ( _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, such
representation shall not contain a knowledge qualifier)) that authorizes the
distribution of such Confidential Information Memorandum to prospective
Lenders (other than Disqualified Lenders) and confirms that the public-side
version does not include material non-public information with respect to the
Acquired Business or its securities for purposes of United States federal and
state securities laws; (ii) each Confidential Information Memorandum will
exculpate the Sponsors, the Buyers, the SPAC, the Acquired Business and us and
your and our respective affiliates with respect to the content and the use of
such Confidential Information Memorandum or any related marketing material by
the recipients thereof; (iii) the public-side version of the Confidential
Information Memorandum and information provided to Public Lenders may include
the following information, except to the extent you notify us to the contrary
(prior to their distribution) and provided that you have been given a
reasonable opportunity to review such public-side version and comply with U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements: (A) drafts and
final Facilities Documentation, related definitive documentation (if any) and
customary marketing term sheets that have been approved by you (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (B) administrative materials
prepared by the Lead Arrangers for prospective Lenders (such as a lender
meeting invitation, allocations and funding and closing memoranda) and (C)
notification of changes in the terms of the Facilities; (iv) at our request,
you agree to use your commercially reasonable efforts to identify information
to be distributed to Public Lenders by clearly and conspicuously marking the
same as "PUBLIC"; and (v) we will be entitled to treat any Information and
Projections that are not specifically identified as "PUBLIC" as being suitable
for posting only on the portion of the Platform not available to or accessible
by Public Lenders.

__Fees__ _._

As consideration for the commitments of each Initial Lender and each Lead
Arrangers and other agents agreements to perform the services described
herein, you agree to pay the fees set forth in the fee letter dated the date
hereof and delivered in connection with the Facilities (the " _Fee Letter_ ")
and in the term sheets attached to this Commitment Letter. Once paid, such

__Conditions Precedent__ _._ 

---|--- 
 

The commitments of each Initial Lender with respect to the Facilities and each
Lead Arrangers and each agents agreements to perform the services described
herein are subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by the Lead Arrangers) of
only the conditions precedent explicitly set forth on the exhibit to this
Commitment Letter labeled "Conditions Annex" (such conditions, the "
_Financing Conditions_ ," and such exhibit, the " _Conditions Annex_ ").

Notwithstanding anything in the Commitment Papers, the Facilities
Documentation or any other agreement or other undertaking concerning the
financing of the Transactions to the contrary, the following provisions (the "
_Certain Funds Provisions_ ") will apply:

 

(a) the only representations and warranties that will be made on the Closing
Date and the making and accuracy of which will be a condition to the initial
availability of the Facilities on the Closing Date will be the Acquisition
Agreement Representations and the Specified Representations; _provided_ , that
a failure of any Acquisition Agreement Representation to be accurate will
not result in a failure of a Financing Condition or a default under the
Facilities Documentation, unless such failure results (or resulted) in a
failure of a condition precedent to Buyers (or its affiliates) obligation to
consummate the Acquisition or such failure gives (or gave) the Buyer the
right (taking into account any notice and cure provisions) to terminate the
Buyers (or its affiliates) obligations, in each case, pursuant to the terms
of the Acquisition Agreement;

(b) the terms of the Facilities Documentation and the Closing Deliverables
will be subject to the Documentation Principles, will contain no conditions
to the initial funding of the Facilities other than the Financing Conditions,
and in any event will be in a form such that they do not impair the
availability of the Facilities on the Closing Date if the
Financing Conditions are satisfied (or waived by the Lead Arrangers); it
being understood that, (i) the attachment and perfection of any lien on
Collateral (other than Collateral consisting of personal property) securing a
secured facility is not a condition precedent to the availability of any
Facility, will not affect the size of any Facility and will not result in a
default under any Facility and (ii) if any lien on personal property
Collateral securing a secured Facility does not attach or become perfected on
the Closing Date after your use of commercially reasonable efforts to do so,
such attachment or such perfection will not constitute a condition precedent
to the availability of any Facility, will not affect the size of any Facility
and will not result in a default under any Facility, but will be required
within 90 days after the Closing Date (subject to extensions agreed to by the
Administrative Agents in their reasonable discretion); _provided_ that
the foregoing will not limit the conditions precedent set forth in Sections
5(b) and 5(d) of _Exhibit E_ hereto, including requiring the authorization of
"all asset" UCC and PPSA filings and delivery of certain equity
securities constituting Collateral, in each case, with customary stock powers
executed in blank; and

(c) there are no conditions (implied or otherwise) to the commitments and
agreements hereunder (including compliance with the terms of the Commitment
Papers or the Facilities Documentation), other than the Financing Conditions,
and upon satisfaction (or waiver by the Lead Arrangers) of the Financing
Conditions, each of the Administrative Agents and the Initial Lenders and each
other party thereto will execute and deliver the Facilities Documentation for
such Facilities to be funded on the Closing Date to which it is a party
and the initial funding under such Facilities will occur.

" _Acquisition Agreement Representations_ " means such of the representations
and warranties made by the Acquired Business with respect to the Acquired
Business in the Acquisition Agreement to the extent a breach of

 



A-104

    

 such representations and warranties is material and adverse to the interests
of the Lenders (in their capacities as such).

 

" _Specified Representations_ " means the representations and warranties of
the Borrower and Holdings set forth in the Facilities Documentation relating
to their organizational existence, organizational power and authority (only as
to execution, delivery and performance of the applicable Facilities
Documentation and the extensions of credit thereunder), their
due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability (against them) of
the applicable Facilities Documentation, solvency on a consolidated basis as
of the Closing Date after giving effect to the Transactions (consistent with
the solvency certificate attached to this Commitment Letter), no conflicts of
Facilities Documentation with their charter documents (as in effect upon
consummation of, or immediately after consummation of, the Acquisition and the
adoption of any related resolutions), compliance of the Transactions with
Federal Reserve margin regulations, the Investment Company Act, the Patriot
Act, use of proceeds not violating the OFAC and FCPA and the creation,

__Indemnification; Expenses__ _._ 

---|--- 
 

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Commitment Party and its
affiliates and controlling persons and the respective officers, directors,
employees, partners, agents and representatives of each of the foregoing and
their successors and permitted assigns (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, to which
any such Indemnified Person may become subject arising out of, resulting from
or in connection with the Commitment Papers, the Transactions or the
Facilities, or any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding (each, an "
_Action_ ") relating to any of the foregoing, regardless of whether any such
Indemnified Person is a party thereto and whether or not such Action is
brought by you, your equity holders, affiliates, creditors or any other
person, and to reimburse each such Indemnified Person, promptly after receipt
of a written request, together with customary backup documentation in
reasonable detail, for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal
expenses (limited to one counsel for all Indemnified Persons taken as a whole
and, if reasonably necessary, a single local counsel for all Indemnified
Persons taken as a whole in each relevant material jurisdiction (which may be
a single local counsel acting in multiple jurisdictions) and, solely in the
case of any actual or perceived conflict of interest between Indemnified
Persons where the Indemnified Persons affected by such conflict inform you of
such conflict, one additional counsel in each relevant material jurisdiction
to each group of affected Indemnified Persons similarly situated, taken as a
whole) or other reasonable and documented in reasonable detail out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending any of the
foregoing; _provided_ , that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any
Indemnified Person, apply to losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
to the extent (a) resulting from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence of such Indemnified Person or any Related Indemnified Persons (as
defined below) of such Indemnified Person, (b) arising from a material breach
of the obligations of such Indemnified Person or any Related Indemnified
Persons of such Indemnified Person under the Commitment Papers or the
Facilities Documentation, including the failure to fund the Facilities upon
satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Conditions (in the case of clauses (a)
and (b), as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable judgment), or (c) arising from any dispute among Indemnified
Persons or any Related Indemnified Persons of the foregoing other than any
Actions against any Commitment Party in its collective capacities or in
fulfilling its role as an Initial Lender, Lead Arranger, Administrative Agent
or other agent role under any Facility and other than any claims arising out
of any act or omission on the part of you or any of your
affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Indemnified Person shall be
obligated to refund and return promptly any and all amounts paid under the
indemnification provisions of this Commitment Letter to such Indemnified
Person and its Related Indemnified Persons for any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses to the extent such Indemnified Person and its
Related Indemnified Persons is not entitled to payment of such amounts in
accordance with the terms hereof as finally determined by a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and, to the extent
not a party hereto, the agreement of an Indemnified Party to this provision is
a condition to the indemnity provided herein. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Commitment Letter, except to the extent

 



A-105

    

 resulting from the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of (or
material breach of the Commitment Papers by) such Indemnified Person or any
Related Indemnified Persons of the foregoing (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment), (a) no
Indemnified Person will be liable for any damages arising from the use by
others of information or other materials obtained through electronic,
telecommunications or other information transmission systems (including the
Platform) and (b) neither any Indemnified Person, nor Buyer or the Acquired
Business (or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
controlling persons, controlled affiliates or agents) will be liable for any
indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages in connection with the
Commitment Papers, the Facilities, the Transactions (including the Facilities
and the use of proceeds thereunder), or with respect to any activities or
other transactions related to the Facilities; _provided_ that this sentence
shall not limit your indemnification or reimbursement obligations set forth
herein to the extent such special, indirect, punitive or consequential
damages are included in any third-party claim in connection with which such
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding
anything in the Commitment Papers, you will have no obligation to indemnify
any Indemnified Person for income taxes, franchise taxes or branch profits
taxes incurred by such person in connection with the fees or other
compensation such person receives in connection with the Commitment Papers,
in each case as a result of any present or former connection between such
Indemnified Person and the relevant taxing jurisdiction (other than a
connection arising solely as a result of this Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter, the Engagement Letter and/or any of the transactions contemplated
thereunder). You will not be liable for any settlement of any Action effected
without your prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (it being understood that consent withheld for failure of
any of the conditions in the immediately succeeding sentence to be true is
reasonable)), but, if settled with your written consent or if there is a final
judgment in any such Actions, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses by reason of such settlement or judgment in
accordance with the indemnification provisions of this Commitment Letter. You
will not, without the prior written consent of an Indemnified Person, effect
any settlement of any Action in respect of which indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person unless such settlement (i)
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Actions and (ii) does
not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a
failure to act by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person.

For purposes hereof, a " _Related Indemnified Person_ " of an Indemnified
Person means (a) any controlling person or controlled affiliate of such
Indemnified Person, (b) the respective directors, officers, or employees of
such Indemnified Person or any of its controlling persons or controlled
affiliates and (c) the respective agents of such Indemnified Person or any of
its controlling persons or controlled affiliates, in the case of this clause
(c), acting at the instructions of such Indemnified Person, controlling
person or such controlled affiliate; _provided_ that each reference to a
controlled affiliate or controlling person in this sentence pertains to a
controlled affiliate or controlling person involved in the negotiation or
syndication of this Commitment Letter and the Facilities.

Upon and subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date and the initial
funding of the Facilities, you agree to reimburse each Commitment Party for
its reasonable and documented in reasonable detail out-of-pocket expenses
(including expenses of each Commitment Partys due diligence investigation,
syndication expenses, travel expenses and reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket fees, disbursements and other charges of the single counsel to the
Commitment Parties identified in the Term Sheet and, if reasonably necessary,
of a single local counsel to the Commitment Parties in each relevant material
jurisdiction, which may be a single local counsel acting in multiple material
jurisdictions and in the case of any actual or perceived conflict of interest,
one additional counsel in each relevant material jurisdiction), in each case,
incurred solely in connection with due diligence and the preparation,
negotiation, execution and delivery of the Commitment Papers and the
Facilities Documentation and any related definitive documentation
(collectively, the " _Expenses_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, you will not
be required to reimburse the Commitment Parties for any Expenses in the event
the Closing Date does not occur. You acknowledge that the Commitment Parties
may receive a benefit, including, without limitation, a discount, credit or
other accommodation, from any such counsel based on the fees such counsel may
receive on account of their relationship with us, including without
limitation, fees paid pursuant hereto. The

 



A-106

    

 foregoing provisions in this paragraph shall be superseded in each case, to
the extent covered thereby, by the application provisions contained in the
Facilities Documentation upon execution thereof and thereafter shall have no
further force and effect.

__Sharing Information; Absence of Fiduciary Relationship; Affiliate
Activities; Binding Obligations__ _._ 

---|--- 

You acknowledge that each Commitment Party and its affiliates may be
providing debt financing, equity capital or other services (including
investment banking and financial advisory services, securities trading,
hedging, financing and brokerage activities, and financial planning and
benefits counseling) to other companies in respect of which the Acquired
Business may have conflicting interests. We will not furnish confidential
information obtained from you by virtue of the transactions contemplated by
this Commitment Letter or our other relationships with you to such other
companies. You also acknowledge that we do not have any obligation to use, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter, or to
furnish to you, confidential information obtained by us or any of
our respective affiliates from such other companies.

You further acknowledge and agree that (a) no fiduciary, advisory or
agency relationship between you and any Commitment Party is intended to be or
has been created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Commitment Letter, irrespective of whether such Commitment Party has advised
or is advising you on other matters, (b) each Commitment Party, on the one
hand, and you, on the other hand, have an arms-length business relationship
that does not, directly or indirectly, give rise to, nor do you rely on, any
fiduciary duty on the part of such Commitment Party, and you waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any claims you may have against us for breach
of fiduciary duty or alleged breach of fiduciary duty and agree that we will
have no liability (whether direct or indirect) to you in respect of such a
fiduciary duty claim or to any person asserting a fiduciary duty claim on your
behalf, including equity holders, employees or creditors, (c) you are capable
of evaluating and understanding, and you understand and accept, the terms,
risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Commitment
Letter, (d) you have been advised that each Commitment Party and its

Commitment Party has no obligation to disclose such interests and transactions
to you or your affiliates, (e) you have consulted your own legal, accounting,
regulatory and tax advisors to the extent you have deemed appropriate and (f)
each Commitment Party has been, is and will be acting solely as a principal
and, except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties,
has not been, is not and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary
for you, any of your affiliates or any other person or entity. In addition,
each Commitment Party may employ the services of its affiliates in
providing certain services hereunder and may exchange with such affiliates in
connection therewith information concerning the Acquired Business, and such
affiliates will be entitled to the benefits afforded to, and subject to the
obligations of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, confidentiality
obligations), such Commitment Party under this Commitment Letter.

You further acknowledge that each Commitment Party and its affiliates may be
a full service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage
activities, as well as providing investment banking and other financial
services. In the ordinary course of business, each Commitment Party may
provide investment banking and other financial services to, and/or acquire,
hold or sell, for their respective own accounts and the accounts of customers,
equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments (including bank
loans and other obligations) of the Sponsors and the Acquired Business and
other companies with which the Sponsors or the Acquired Business may have
commercial or other relationships. With respect to any securities and/or
financial instruments so held by each Commitment Party, its affiliates or any
of its customers, all rights in respect of such securities and financial
instruments, including any voting rights, will be exercised by the holder of
the rights, in its sole discretion.

You further acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for making your own
independent judgment with respect to the Transactions and the process leading
thereto. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that we are not advising you
as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any
jurisdiction. You will consult with your own advisors concerning such matters
and will be responsible for making your own independent investigation and
appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby.

We represent and warrant that the Commitment Papers constitute our legally
valid and binding obligation to provide services and perform our other
obligations set forth herein and to fund the Facilities upon satisfaction or
waiver of the Financing Conditions, in each case, enforceable at law and in
equity in accordance with their terms (subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally); _provided_ that it is
acknowledged and agreed by each party hereto that the initial funding of the
Facilities will be subject solely to the Financing Conditions. You represent
and warrant that the Commitment Papers constitute your legally valid and
binding obligation, enforceable at law and in equity against you
in accordance with their terms (subject to the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally); _provided_ that nothing
contained in the Commitment Papers obligates you or any of your affiliates to
consummate any Transaction or to draw upon all or any portion of the
Facilities.

 

You further acknowledge that MSSF and/or its affiliates have been retained by
the Borrower as financial advisor (in such capacity, the "Borrower Financial
Advisor") in connection with the Acquisition. You agree to such retention, and
further agree not to assert any claim you might allege based on any actual or
potential conflicts of interest that might be asserted to arise or result
from, on the one hand, the engagement of each Borrower Financial Advisor
and/or its affiliates, on the one hand, including with respect to arranging or
providing financing for a competing bidder, and, on the other hand, our and
our affiliates relationships with you described and referred to herein. You
acknowledge that, in such capacity, each Borrower Financial Advisor may advise
the Borrower in other manners adverse to the interests of the parties hereto.
Each of the financial institutions hereto acknowledges (i) the retention of
such entities as a Borrower Financial Advisor and (ii) that such relationship
does not create any fiduciary duties or fiduciary responsibilities to such
financial institution on the part of such entities or their affiliates.

After the closing of the Transactions and at such Commitment Partys expense,
each Commitment Party may (i) after consultation with the Borrower, place

In addition, the Commitment Parties may disclose the existence of the
Facilities and the information about the Facilities to market data collectors,
similar service providers to the lending industry, and service providers to
such Commitment Party in connection with the administration and management of
the Facilities.

The obligations under this Section 12 with respect to this Commitment Letter
but not the Fee Letter will automatically terminate and be superseded by the
confidentiality provisions in the Facilities Documentation (to the extent set

Documentation and in any event will terminate on the first anniversary of the
date of this Commitment Letter.

this Commitment Letter and the commitments and undertakings of each Commitment
Party hereunder will automatically terminate, unless such Commitment
Party, in its discretion, agrees to an extension. The termination of any
commitment pursuant to this paragraph will not prejudice your or our rights
and remedies in respect of any breach or repudiation of the Commitment Papers.

" _Transaction Description_ "1

 

It is intended that:

(a) The Buyer, which will be formed at the direction of Conyers Park II
Acquisition Corp. (the " _SPAC_ "), will, directly or indirectly, acquire (the
" _Acquisition_ ") the Acquired Business pursuant to the Agreement and Plan
of Merger, between the Buyer, the SPAC, Advantage Solutions Inc. and Karman
Topco, L.P. (including all schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto, and as
amended or modified from time to time in a manner that would not result in a
failure of the condition precedent set forth in paragraph 1 of the Conditions
Annex, the " _Acquisition Agreement_ ");

(b) The SPAC, the Sponsors, members of management of the Acquired Business
and other equity investors (collectively, the " _Investors_ ") will, directly
or indirectly, contribute to the Buyer (or a direct or indirect parent of the
Buyer) cash and/or rollover equity in exchange for common or preferred equity
constituting Disqualified Equity Interests (as defined in the First Lien
Documents) of the Borrower (or such direct or indirect parent), which, with
respect to any preferred equity of the Borrower, if any, will be on terms
reasonably acceptable to the Lead Arrangers (the " _Equity Contribution_ ").
Any such parent will contribute, or cause to be contributed, all such cash and
equity to the Borrower immediately after the initial funding of the
Facilities and the consummation of the merger. The aggregate amount of the
Equity Contribution will represent not less than 35% (the " _Minimum Equity
Contribution_ ") of the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the
loans funded under the ABL Facility on the Closing Date, other than letters of
credit and amounts borrowed to cash collateralize letters of credit, to fund
any OID or fees pursuant to the "market flex" provisions of the Fee Letter or
to fund working capital, (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the term loans
borrowed under the First Lien Term Facility on the Closing Date (and the gross
cash proceeds of any debt securities issued by the Borrower on or prior to
the Acquisition Date in lieu of the First Lien Term Facility), and (iii) the
amount of such cash and fair market value of rollover equity contributed, in
each case, on the Closing Date; _provided_ that the amount of any First Lien
Flex Increase (as defined in the Fee Letter) will be excluded;

(c) The Borrower will:

 



     |  |  |

obtain $400 million (or such lower amount as the Borrower may request) in
commitments under a senior secured asset-based credit facility (the " _ABL
Facility_ ") having the terms materially consistent with those set forth in
the Summary of Principal Terms and Conditions attached to this Commitment
Letter as _Exhibit B_ , including the terms of _Exhibits C,_ _D_ and _F_
incorporated therein (the " _ABL Term Sheet_ "); 

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

obtain $2,100 million (or such lower amount as the Borrower may request and as
such amount may be increased pursuant to a First Lien Flex Increase (as
defined in the Fee Letter)) in aggregate principal amount of senior secured
term loans (the " _First Lien Term Facility_ "), having terms materially
consistent with those set forth on the term sheet attached to the Commitment
Letter as _Exhibit C_ , including the terms of _Exhibits_ __ _ B_, _D_ and
_F_ incorporated therein (the " _First Lien Term Sheet_ " and, together with
the ABL Term Sheet, and the Financing Conditions set forth as _Exhibit_ __ _
F_ and the Certain Definitions set forth as _Exhibit_ __ _ E_, the " _Term
Sheets_ " and each, a " _Term Sheet_ ); _provided_ that the

 aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Term Loans to be funded on the
Acquisition Date shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the gross
cash proceeds of any debt securities issued by the Borrower on or prior to the
Acquisition Date, which gross cash proceeds are available to consummate the
Transactions on the Acquisition Date (a " _First Lien Term Loan Decrease_ ");
and 

---|--- 
 

(d) The proceeds of the Equity Contribution, the initial borrowing under the
ABL Facility (if any), the initial borrowing under the First Lien Term
Facility and cash on hand at the Company and its subsidiaries on the Closing
Date will be applied on the Closing Date to:

 

(i) finance the repayment of debt of the Acquired Business (and termination of
commitments thereunder and release of all guarantees, liens and security
interests related thereto) with respect to which the Acquisition Agreement
requires the delivery of a payoff letter (the " _Refinancing_ "); and

 

(ii) pay fees, costs and expenses related to the Transactions (such fees,
costs and expenses, the " _Transaction Costs_ ") and make such other payments
as are contemplated on the Term Sheets.

The transactions described above, together with the transactions related
thereto, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Transactions_." The
Term Sheets, which contain all material terms related to the Facilities, are
the result of extensive negotiations among the parties hereto and the terms
set forth therein are an integral and necessary part of the Transactions. The
Transactions as a whole, including the Acquisition, constitute a unique
opportunity for the SPAC and the Borrower. For purposes of the Commitment
Papers, (i) " _Acquisition Date_ " means the date or time that the
Acquisition is consummated pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement,
(ii) " _Closing Date_ " means the date the initial funding under (a) the
ABL Facility and (b) the First Lien Term Facility, and (iii) " _Facilities_ "
means, collectively, the ABL Facility and the First Lien Term Facility and "
_Facility_ " means either of them. All references to (a) " _dollars_ " and "
_$_ " are to the lawful currency of the United States of America and (b) "
_Alternative Currencies_ " means currencies other than dollars from time to
time agreed by the Borrower, the applicable Administrative Agent and (i) if
in connection with the ABL Facility or any Incremental ABL Facility, the ABL
Lenders (including the lenders providing such Incremental ABL Facility, if
applicable), the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks and (ii) if in
connection with any Incremental First Lien Term Facility, the lenders
providing such Incremental First Lien Term Facility.

$400 million ABL Facility

 

 _Term Sheet 1 _

 



        |  | 
---|---|--- 
     _Borrower_ : |  | Advantage Sales and Marketing Inc. (the "
_Borrower_ ") and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of a domestic entity ("
_Holdings_ "). 
   | 
   _Lead Arrangers_ : |  | BofA Securities, MSSF and DBSI and such other
arrangers appointed by the Borrower pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letter (together with their designated affiliates, the " _Lead Arrangers_ "). 
   | 
   _Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent_: |  | Bank of America
will act as sole administrative agent and sole collateral agent (in such
capacities, the " _ABL Administrative Agent_ ") for the ABL Lenders (as
defined below) providing the ABL Facility as described in this Term Sheet. 
   | 
   _Transactions_ : |  | As described in the "Transaction Description"
attached to the Commitment Letter. 
   | 
   _Lenders_ : |  | Bank of America or its affiliate(s), MSSF or its
affiliate(s) and DBSI or its affiliate(s) and a syndicate of financial
institutions and other lenders (the " _ABL Lenders_ ") arranged by the Lead
Arrangers and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower (such acceptance not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), including Relationship Lenders and
excluding Disqualified Lenders. 
   | 
   _ABL Facility_ : |  | A senior secured asset-based credit facility in
an aggregate principal amount equal to $400 million (the " _ABL Facility_ "
and the loans thereunder the " _ABL Loans_ "). Amounts under the ABL
Facility will initially be available in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars
and, after the Closing Date, in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and other
Alternative Currencies agreed to by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and
each ABL Lender providing such loans. 
   | 
   _Letters of Credit_ : |  | An amount equal to $150 million (or such
higher amount as the Borrower and the ABL Lenders may agree) of the ABL
Facility will be available to the Borrower in the form of letters of credit.
Letters of credit will be issued by each of the ABL Lenders (pro rata based
on their respective commitments thereunder) (in such capacity, the " _Issuing
Banks_ "). Each letter of credit will be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian
dollars or an Alternative Currency and, except to the extent cash
collateralized or backstopped pursuant to arrangements reasonably acceptable
to the applicable Issuing Bank, will expire not later than the earlier of (a)
twelve months after its date of issuance and (b) the fifth business day prior
to the final maturity of the ABL Facility; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
letter of credit may provide for renewal thereof for additional periods of up
to twelve months on customary terms (which in no event will

All capitalized terms used but not defined in this exhibit have the meanings
given to them in the Commitment Letter to which this exhibit is attached,
including the other exhibits thereto. In the event any such capitalized term
is subject to multiple and differing definitions, the appropriate meaning
thereof in this exhibit is determined by reference to the context in which it
is used.

    |  | extend beyond the date referred to in _clause (b)_ above
unless cash collateral or other assurances have been provided to the
applicable Issuing Bank). Drawings under any letter of credit will be
reimbursed by the Borrower within one business day or if not reimbursed will
automatically increase the ABL Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
otherwise agreed by an ABL Lender in its sole discretion, such ABL Lender (in
its capacity as an Issuing Bank) shall not be required to issue letters of
credit other than standby letters of credit. The face amount of any
outstanding letter of credit (and, without duplication, any unpaid drawing in
respect thereto) will reduce availability under the ABL Facility on a dollar-
for-dollar basis. 
   | 
   _Swingline Facility_ : |  | In connection with the ABL Facility, the
ABL Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the " _Swingline Lender_ ") will
make available to the Borrower a swingline facility under which the Borrower
may make short-term borrowings of up to $40 million (or such higher amount as
the Borrower and the ABL Administrative Agent may agree). Except for purposes
of calculating the commitment fee described below, any such swingline
borrowings will reduce availability under the ABL Facility on a dollar-for-
dollar basis. The Lenders will be unconditionally obligated to purchase
participations in any swingline loan _pro rata_ based upon their commitments
under the ABL Facility. 
   | 
   _Incremental ABL Facilities_ : |  |

The ABL Loan Documents will permit the Borrower to increase commitments under
the ABL Facility (any such increase, an " _Incremental ABL Facility_ ") in
minimum amounts consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles.



 

The aggregate principal amount of Incremental ABL Facilities outstanding on
any date commitments with respect to such facilities are received may not
exceed the greater of (i) $175 million and (ii) the Borrowing Base then in
effect.



 

The Incremental ABL Facilities will be available at the request of the
Borrower with consent required only from those lenders that agree, in their
discretion, to participate in such Incremental ABL Facility. Lenders
providing an Incremental ABL Facility will be reasonably acceptable to (a) the
Borrower, (b) the ABL Administrative Agent, and (c) the Issuing Banks and
Swingline Lenders (but, in each case of clauses (b) and (c), only to the
extent such person would otherwise have a consent right to an assignment of
such loans or commitments to such lender, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



The incurrence of indebtedness under an Incremental ABL Facility will be
subject to only the following conditions and to any other conditions agreed
between the lenders under the Incremental ABL Facility and the Borrower,
measured on the date commitments with respect to such facilities are received,
in each case subject to the Borrowers LCA Election rights: (i) no event of
default will have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, and
(ii) all representations and warranties must be true and correct in all
material respects immediately prior to, and after giving effect to, the
incurrence of such Incremental Facility; _provided_ that if such incurrence is
in connection with a

Permitted Acquisition, Acquisition Transaction (to be defined in a manner
consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles) or other permitted
investment or acquisition (collectively, " _Permitted Investments_ ", and each
a " _Permitted Investment_ ") the condition set forth in clause (i) may be
waived by the providers of any such Incremental ABL Facility (other than an
event of default resulting from non-payment of principal or interest under the
ABL Facilities or bankruptcy of the Borrower (such events of default, "
_Specified Events of Default_ ")) and the condition set forth in clause (ii)
may be made subject to customary "certain funds" provisions; provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, any Borrowing Base requirement shall be satisfied
according to the terms hereof without regard to the "certain funds"
provisions.



The ABL Loan Documents will also require that, except with respect to any
commitment, arrangement, upfront or similar fees that may be agreed to among
the Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental ABL Facility, all

   _Purpose_ : |  |

The letters of credit and proceeds of the ABL Loans will be used by the
Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date for

Borrowing Base Certificate shall have been delivered, the Borrowing Base, as
applicable; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, availability shall
always be subject to either the Closing Borrowing Base or the Borrowing
Base); _provided_ , _further_ , that on the Closing Date, the amount of
drawings under the ABL Facility will be limited to $50 million _plus_ the sum
of the following amounts (i) for replacing and/or backstopping existing
letters of credit and refinancing any revolving facility of the Company or its
subsidiaries (with respect to any such refinancing of any revolving facility
in an amount not to exceed $50 million in the aggregate), (ii) to finance

    _ABL Documentation Principles_ : |  |

The definitive documentation for the ABL Facility (the " _ABL Loan Documents_
") will (a) be initially prepared by counsel to the Borrower, (b) contain
only the terms and conditions set forth in this _Exhibit B_ , (c) reflect the
operational and strategic requirements of the Borrower and its subsidiaries in
light of their consolidated capital structure, size, geographic location,
businesses and business practices, operations, financial accounting, matters
disclosed in the Acquisition Agreement and the proposed business plan
(including the sponsor model dated as of August 5, 2020 (the " _Sponsor
Model_ ") and investment thesis) and the industry and practices of Borrower,
in each case, after giving effect to the Transactions, (d) be consistent with
the proposed business plan, Sponsor Model and projections, in each case
delivered to the Commitment Parties prior to the date of the Commitment
Letter, (e) be based on, and, with respect to non-ABL Facility terms, no less
favorable (except as expressly set forth in this _Exhibit B_ ) to, the
Company and its subsidiaries than the documentation for the First Lien Term
Facility as set forth on _Exhibit C_ ( _provided_ that terms specific to asset
based revolving facilities shall be based on, and giving due regard to, those
set forth in the draft documentation dated as of February 20, 2020 previously
provided to you titled "ABL Revolving Credit Agreement" by and among Karman
Intermediate Corp. as Holdings, Advantages Sales and Marketing Inc. as the
Borrower (the " _ABL Identified Precedent_ "), (f) contain those covenant
"baskets" and exceptions set forth in the documentation for the First Lien
Term Facility (except to the extent expressly set forth in this _Exhibit B_ ,
including for the avoidance of doubt replacement of unlimited incurrence
ratios (other than debt and liens) and any available amount builder basket
with baskets based on Payment Conditions);  _provided_ , the ABL Loan
Documents will be modified as necessary (i) (x) to take into account any
changes in law or accounting standards and (y) to reflect customary
modifications to the operational and agency provisions to reflect the
requirements of the ABL Administrative Agent and (ii) to reflect customary
provisions relating to the Canadian Loan Parties (as defined below). The
foregoing is referred to herein, collectively, as the " _ABL
Documentation Principles_." Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
Term Sheet shall have meanings given to them in the documentation for the
First Lien Term Facility as set forth on _Exhibit C _(or with respect to
capitalized terms specific to asset-based revolving facilities, consistent
with the ABL Documentation Principles). The ABL Loan Documents will contain
only those payment provisions, conditions to borrowing, mandatory prepayments,
representations and warranties, covenants, events of default and guarantee
and collateral provisions expressly set forth in this _Exhibit B_ , in each
case, applicable to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to the extent
set forth herein (and to the extent set forth below, Holdings) and with
standards, qualifications, thresholds, exceptions, "baskets" and grace and
cure periods consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles.



 

For purposes of the ABL Loan Documents, if any "market flex" provisions are
exercised with respect to the First Lien Term Facility, whether before
or after the Closing Date, the applicable incurrence based covenant levels
based on leverage shall be adjusted in the ABL Loan 

 



A-122

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | Documents (or pursuant to an amendment thereto, which shall
require only the consent of the Borrower and the First Lien Administrative
Agent) in order to make corresponding adjustments to account for additional
indebtedness and any OID or upfront fees and to maintain the agreed cushions
and/or reflect the adjusted "Closing Date" leverage levels (or offset thereto)
resulting from the exercise of such "market flex" terms. 
   | 
   _Availability_ : |  | Loans under the ABL Facility will be available,
subject to the Closing Borrowing Base or Borrowing Base, as applicable, at any
time prior to the final maturity of the ABL Facility, in minimum principal
amounts consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles; _provided_ that the
aggregate amount of borrowings on the Closing Date shall be limited as set
forth under the heading "Purpose" above. Amounts repaid under the ABL Facility
may be reborrowed, subject to the then-applicable Closing Borrowing Base or
Borrowing Base, as applicable. 
   | 
   _Closing Borrowing Base_ : |  | The borrowing base for purposes of
drawings and letters of credit under the ABL Facility on the Closing Date (the
" _Closing Borrowing Base_ ") will be equal to $250 million. The Closing
Borrowing Base shall be in effect until the earlier of (i) 90 days after the
Closing Date and (ii) receipt by the ABL Administrative Agent of (and
reasonable opportunity to review) an initial field examination consistent with
the ABL Documentation Principles and a Borrowing Base Certificate with
respect thereof; _provided_ , that in the event that the ABL Administrative
Agent has not received such initial field examination within 90 days after the
Closing Date, the Borrowing Base (as defined below) shall be deemed to be $0
until such initial field examination appraisal (and a Borrowing Base
Certificate with respect thereof) is delivered. 
   | 
   _Borrowing Base_ : |  |

Subject to receipt by the ABL Administrative Agent of the initial field
examination, the borrowing base (the " _Borrowing Base_ ") at any time shall
equal the sum of the following:



(a) (i) in the case of investment grade eligible billed receivables, 90% of
the dollar equivalent of the face amount of such eligible receivables of the
Loan Parties; (ii) in the case of other eligible billed receivables, 85% of
the dollar equivalent of the face amount of such eligible receivables of the
Loan Parties; and (iii) in the case of eligible unbilled receivables, 75% of
the dollar equivalent of the face amount of such eligible receivables of the
Loan Parties (in each case, calculated net of all finance charges, late fees
and other fees that are unearned, sales, excise or similar taxes, and credits
or allowances granted at such time, but without duplication of eligibility
criteria or Reserves), __provided__ that the amount calculated pursuant to
clause (iii) shall not exceed 30% of the Borrowing Base at any time;

_plus_

 



(b) 100% of qualified cash of the Loan Parties (which shall be in a blocked
account of the ABL Administrative Agent, or in a blocked account at another
institution reasonably acceptable to the ABL Administrative Agent subject to
customary reporting in connection with (i) the delivery of a borrowing base
certificate, (ii) any request for a credit extension and (iii) any action
incurred in reliance on the Payment Conditions (as defined below)); _minus_

 


 
 



A-123

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

(d) Eligible Reserves (as defined below).



 

Eligibility criteria for eligible receivables and qualified cash included in
the Borrowing Base shall be set forth in the ABL Loan Documents in a
manner consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles.



The Borrowing Base will be computed by the Borrower monthly (or more
frequently if the Borrower in its sole discretion shall so elect and, if so
elected, continued on such basis for at least 60 consecutive days), and a
certificate (the " _Borrowing Base Certificate_ ") presenting the Borrowers
computation of the Borrowing Base will be delivered to the ABL Administrative
Agent no event later than the 20th day following the end of each calendar
month; _provided, however_ , that (i) while any Delivery Condition (as defined
below) applies, the Borrower will be required to compute the Borrowing Base
and deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate on a weekly basis by Thursday of the
following week for so long as such Delivery Condition applies and (ii) during
the continuance of a Specified Default, the Borrower will be required to
compute the Borrowing Base and deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate as
frequently as reasonably requested by the ABL Administrative Agent (but not
more frequently than on a weekly basis) and only for so long as such Specified
Default is continuing.



 

" _Delivery Condition_ " means (a) the period from the date that Specified
Excess Availability shall have been less than the greater of (i) $31.25
million and (ii) 12.5% of the Maximum Borrowing Amount for five consecutive
business days to the date that Specified Excess Availability shall have been
no less than the greater of (i) $31.25 million and (ii) 12.5% of the
Maximum Borrowing Amount for twenty consecutive calendar days.



" _Maximum Borrowing Amount_ " shall mean the lesser of (a) the aggregate
amount of the aggregate Revolving Commitments at such time and (b) the
Borrowing Base then in effect.



 

Any Current Asset Collateral subject to a first lien (other than permitted
liens) in favor of the ABL Administrative Agent (" _Acquired Asset
Borrowing Base_ ") acquired by any Loan Party in a permitted acquisition
shall be immediately included in the Borrowing Base applying eligibility and
reserve criteria consistent with those applied to the calculation of the
Borrowing Base;  _provided_ , that (i) prior to completion of a field
examination with respect to any such acquired Current Asset Collateral, the
applicable Acquired Asset Borrowing Base shall be limited to 20% of the
Borrowing Base and (ii) in the event that the ABL Administrative Agent has
not received such initial field examination within 90 days after the date of
any such acquisition, the applicable Acquired Asset Borrowing Base shall be
deemed to be $0 until such initial field examination is delivered.



The ABL Administrative Agent will have the right to establish and modify
Eligible Reserves against the Borrowing Base assets in its Permitted
Discretion, with five business days prior written notice to the 

 



A-124

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

Borrower (which notice will include a reasonably detailed description of the
reserve being established). During such five business day period, the ABL
Administrative Agent will, if requested, discuss any such reserve or change
with the Borrower, and the Borrower may take such action as may be required so
that the event, condition or matter that is the basis for such reserve
or change no longer exists or exists in a manner that would result in the
establishment of a lower reserve or result in a lesser change, in each case,
in a manner and to the extent reasonably satisfactory to the ABL
Administrative Agent;  _provided_ that the Borrower shall not be permitted to
request any credit extension during such notice period if it would result in
the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit
drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the ABL Facility to exceed the
Maximum Borrowing Amount after giving pro forma effect to the implementation
of such reserve. For purposes of the foregoing, " _Eligible Reserves_ " means
amounts that the ABL Administrative Agent may from time to time establish in
accordance with the ABL Documentation Principles; provided that they are
established in a manner that reflects changes in the ability of the ABL
Administrative Agent to realize upon the Collateral included in the Borrowing
Base.



" _Permitted Discretion_ " means reasonable credit judgment in accordance
with customary business practices for comparable asset-based lending
transactions; _provided_ that, as it relates to the establishment of new
reserves (other than reserves that are expressly included in the definition
of "reserves" (to be defined in the ABL Loan Documents in a manner consistent
with the ABL Documentation Principles)) or the adjustment or imposition of
exclusionary criteria, Permitted Discretion will require that (a)
such establishment, adjustment or imposition after the Closing Date be based
on the analysis of facts or events first occurring or first discovered by the
ABL Administrative Agent after the Closing Date or are materially different
from facts or events known to the ABL Administrative Agent on the Closing
Date, (b) the amount of any such reserve so established or the effect of any
adjustment or imposition of exclusionary criteria be a reasonable
quantification of changes in the ability of the ABL Administrative Agent to
realize upon the Collateral included in the Borrowing Base and (c) no reserves
or changes will be duplicative of reserves or changes already accounted for
through eligibility criteria (including collection/advance rates).



" _Specified Default_ " shall mean any payment or bankruptcy event of default
with respect to the Loan Parties under the ABL Facility, any event of default
arising from failure to comply with the financial covenant, any event of
default arising from a failure to deliver a Borrowing Base Certificate or
any material misrepresentation therein or any event of default arising from a
failure to comply with the cash management provisions, in each case, when
required and after the expiry of any applicable cure period.

 



The eligibility criteria for receivables shall be consistent with the ABL
Documentation Principles; provided that: the time-based exclusion shall apply
to accounts with respect to which more than 120 days have elapsed from the
original invoice date thereof or which is more than 60 days past 

 



A-125

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | due after the original due date, except that up to $30.0
million of receivables with respect to which more than 120 days, but not more
than 150 days, have elapsed from the original invoice date shall be
deemed eligible. 
   | 
   _Ranking_ : |  | The obligations under the ABL Facility and the ABL
Guarantees (as defined below) will be senior obligations of the Loan Parties
and secured by the following: (a) a first-priority security interest in the
Current Asset Collateral and (b) a second-priority security interest in the
Fixed Asset Collateral. The lien priority, relative rights and other
creditors rights in respect of the Collateral securing the ABL Facility and
the First Lien Term Facility will be set forth in one or more customary
intercreditor agreements (the " _Intercreditor Agreements_ "), which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the ABL Administrative Agent. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Intercreditor Agreements will (i) permit
additional secured indebtedness of the Loan Parties, which indebtedness is
permitted to be incurred and secured (including with respect to the lien
priority thereof) pursuant to the terms of the ABL Loan Documents and the
First Lien Loan Documents, (ii) permit refinancing indebtedness in respect of
the ABL Facility and the First Lien Term or any of the foregoing permitted
additional secured indebtedness referenced in clause (i), (iii) not impose
any restrictions on amendments of the ABL Loan Documents and the First Lien
Loan Documents (other than amendments which would conflict with the
Intercreditor Agreements) and (iv) otherwise contain usual and customary terms
reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and the other secured parties party
thereto. 
   | 
   |  |

" _Current Asset Collateral_ " shall mean Collateral comprising (i) accounts
receivable (except to the extent constituting proceeds of Fixed Asset
Collateral), (ii) inventory, (iii) deposit accounts, securities accounts and
commodities accounts (including all cash or other funds on deposit therein,
except any such accounts which hold solely identifiable proceeds of Fixed
Asset Collateral) and (iv) general intangibles (other than intellectual
property, capital stock and intercompany loans), chattel paper, instruments,
documents, commercial tort claims, letter of credit rights, supporting
obligations, and other assets, in each case to the extent related to the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) and that are owned by a Loan Party or in
which a Loan Party otherwise has rights, but not, for the avoidance of doubt,
including capital stock of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries.



" _Fixed Asset Collateral_ " shall mean all Collateral of the Loan Parties
other than the Current Asset Collateral (including, to the extent constituting
Collateral, real property, intellectual property, equipment, a pledge of the
capital stock of each Loan Partys direct wholly-owned subsidiaries). 

   | 
   _Interest Rates and Fees_ : |  | As set forth on _Annex I_ to the Fee
Letter. 
   | 
   _Maturity_ : |  | The ABL Facility will mature on the 5th anniversary
of the Closing Date and all outstanding amounts thereunder shall be due and
payable on such date; _provided_ that the ABL Loan Documents shall provide the
right for the Borrower to extend commitments and/or outstandings under the
ABL Facility pursuant to one or more tranches with only the consent of the
respective extending ABL Lenders and the ABL Administrative Agent. 
 



A-126

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
   | 
    _Guarantees_ : |  | All obligations of the Borrower under the ABL
Facility and of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries under certain
interest rate protection or other hedging arrangements (including with respect
to currency) entered into with a person that is the ABL Administrative Agent
or an ABL Lender or any affiliate of the ABL Administrative Agent or an ABL
Lender at the time of entering into such arrangements (collectively, the "
_Hedging Arrangements_ ") and certain cash management arrangements entered
into with a person that is the ABL Administrative Agent or a ABL Lender or any
affiliate of any the ABL Administrative Agent or a ABL Lender at the time of
entering into such arrangements (collectively, the " _Cash Management
Arrangements_ " and, together with the Hedging Arrangements, the " _Secured
Agreements_ "), will be unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a
senior secured basis (the " _ABL Guarantees_ ") by Holdings and each existing
and subsequently acquired or organized wholly-owned material U.S. and Canadian
domestic subsidiary of the Borrower, subject to the ABL Documentation
Principles and other than Excluded Subsidiaries (the " _Subsidiary
Guarantors_ " and, together with Holdings, the " _Guarantors_ " and the
Guarantors together with the Borrower, the " _Loan Parties_ " and the Loan
Parties organized in Canada, the " _Canadian Loan Parties_ "). The ABL
Facility Documentation will provide that the term "FSHCO" means any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Holdings that has no material assets other than equity
interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more non-U.S.
subsidiaries of the Borrower (other than Canadian subsidiaries) that are
"controlled foreign corporations" within the meaning of Section 957(a) of
the Code or other FSHCOs. Neither the Acquired Business nor any of its
subsidiaries will be Loan Parties prior to the consummation of the Acquisition
and the initial funding of the Facilities. 
   | 
   _Security_ : |  | Subject to the Certain Funds Provisions, the
obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of the ABL Facility, the ABL
Guarantees and the Secured Agreements will be secured jointly and severally
(subject to permitted liens) by substantially all of the personal property of
the Loan Parties, wherever located, now owned or hereafter acquired
(collectively, the " _Collateral_ "), with the priority as set forth under the
heading "Ranking" above and on terms and conditions (including as to
exceptions, grace periods, limitations and materiality thresholds) the same as
those set forth in the Identified Precedent in accordance with the ABL
Documentation Principles and the Security Agreement (as defined in the ABL
Identified Precedent). 
   | 
   _Cash Management/Cash Dominion_ : |  | The Borrower shall be required
to obtain account control agreements on the primary U.S. and Canadian
concentration accounts and other material deposit accounts consistent with the
ABL Documentation Principles (and subject to exceptions consistent with the
ABL Documentation Principles) of the Borrower and the ABL Guarantors within 90
days of the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be agreed by the ABL
Administrative Agent). If such arrangements are not obtained within 90 days
after the Closing Date, subject to extensions agreed to by the ABL
Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall be required to move its bank accounts
to the ABL Administrative Agent or another bank that has executed such
control agreements.

which are not swept on a daily basis into a concentration account) will be
swept into a collection account maintained with the ABL Administrative Agent
and used to repay borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to customary
exceptions and thresholds (which shall include maintenance of funds by the
Borrower and ABL Guarantors, subject to customary limitations consistent with
the ABL Documentation Principles).

Maximum Borrowing Amount, _minus_ (b) the sum of (i) aggregate principal
amount of all ABL Loans (including Swing Line Loans) then outstanding and (ii)
all amounts outstanding under letters of credit (including issued and undrawn
letters of credit) at such time.



" _Specified Excess Availability_ " means the sum of (a) Excess Availability
at such time plus (b) Suppressed Availability (which shall not be less than
zero) at such time.



 

" _Suppressed Availability_ " means an amount, if positive, by which the
Borrowing Base exceeds the aggregate amount of the commitments under the ABL
Facility; _provided_ , for the purposes of calculating Specified Excess
Availability, Suppressed Availability shall not exceed 2.5% of the aggregate
commitments under the ABL Facility at any time. 

   | 
   _Mandatory Prepayments_ : |  | If at any time, the aggregate amount
of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn
letters of credit under the ABL Facility exceeds the Maximum Borrowing Amount,
then the Borrower will within one business day repay outstanding loans and
cash collateralize outstanding letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess, with no reduction of the commitments. 
   | 
   _Voluntary Prepayments and Reductions in Commitments_ : |  |

" _Payment Conditions_ " shall mean (i) no event of default has occurred and
is continuing or would arise after giving effect to such transaction and (ii)
either (a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would be at least 1.0:1.0 on a pro
forma basis and the Borrower would have Specified Excess Availability of
at least the greater of (x) $31.25 million and (y) 12.5% of the Borrowing
Base (but with respect to restricted payments only, $37.5 million and 15.0%)
on a pro forma basis immediately after giving effect to such transaction and

pro forma basis, or (b) the Borrower would have pro forma Specified Excess
Availability of at least the greater of (x) $43.75 million and (y) 17.5% of

A-133

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

on a pro forma basis.

 



Dollar baskets will include a growing concept based on LTM Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA or, at Borrowers election prior to the launch of general
syndication, consolidated total assets. The general basket for restricted
payments may alternatively be used for investments and/or prepayments of
Junior Financing, and the general basket for prepayments of Junior Financing
may alternatively be used for investments. The Borrower will be permitted to
reclassify its debt and liens (other than debt under and liens securing the
First Lien Term Facility and the ABL Facility), investments, restricted
payments and payments of Junior Financing among baskets within each covenant
without limitation.



 

Compliance with a negative covenant in the ABL Loan Documents may be permitted
in part by one basket or exception and in part by another, in the Borrowers
discretion, and the Borrower may designate and redesignate (on or after any
applicable date) the baskets or exceptions available to it on such date (or
any later date) upon which compliance is based. Unless the Borrower
elects otherwise, compliance will be deemed to be first pursuant to a basket
or exception based on a financial ratio (to the maximum extent permitted by
such basket or exception) prior to being determined to pursuant to any other
basket or exception, including those based on a fixed dollar amount. Agents
will execute intercreditor agreements upon request.



 

The ABL Loan Documents will contain "limited condition transaction" provisions
consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles, which will allow
the Borrower to elect (an " _LCA Election_ ," and the date of such election,
an " _LCA Election Date_ ") to test compliance with any ratio, accuracy of
representation, absence of default or event of default or other
condition precedent (other than (i) any determination of Specified Excess
Availability as a component of the Payment Conditions or (ii) any
determination of Excess Availability as a condition precedent to a credit
extension) in connection with a Permitted Investment as of the date of
execution of a definitive agreement for such Permitted Investment.
Indebtedness under revolving, delayed draw and other committed facilities may
be incurred from time to time if the full amount of such facility was
permitted to be incurred on the date commitments with respect to such
facilities were obtained (and compliance will not need to be tested on any
subsequent date). 

   | 
   _Financial Covenant_ : |  |

Limited to the following:



 

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Covenant Trigger Event,
the ratio (the " _Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio_ ") of (a) Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA _minus_ cash taxes _minus_ non-financed cash capital
expenditures (excluding capital expenditures funded by landlords or with
respect to client-funded technology of Holdings and its restricted
subsidiaries) to (b) consolidated cash interest expense (net of cash interest
income) _plus_ scheduled cash principal amortization of indebtedness for 

 



A-134

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

borrowed money (other than intercompany indebtedness) _plus_ scheduled
payments of principal and interest on account of capital leases plus solely
for purposes of testing Payment Conditions in connection with a restricted
payment, restricted payments made during such period in reliance on the
Payment Conditions, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for which
financial statements are required to be delivered or, with respect to the
date of any Covenant Trigger Event, the last day of the most recently ended
fiscal quarter prior to such date for which financial statements have been
delivered, shall not be less than 1.00:1.00 on a trailing four quarter basis.



A Covenant Trigger Event will occur if Specified Excess Availability shall be
less than the greater of (a) 10% of the Maximum Borrowing Amount and (b) $25
million at any time (commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ended after
the Closing Date) and shall continue until Specified Excess Availability is
equal to or exceeds such amount for thirty consecutive days.



 

For purposes of determining compliance with the foregoing Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, any cash equity contribution (which equity shall be common
equity or other equity on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the
ABL Administrative Agent) made to the Borrower after the end of the relevant
fiscal quarter and not otherwise applied and on or prior to the day that is 10
business days after the day on which financial statements are required to be
delivered for a fiscal quarter or fiscal year and designated on the date of
such contribution as a Specified Equity Contribution (as defined below) will,
at the request of the Borrower, be included in the calculation of
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of determining compliance with
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio at the end of such fiscal quarter and
applicable subsequent periods (any such equity contribution so included in
the calculation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a " _Specified Equity
Contribution_ "); _provided_ only that (a) no more than two Specified Equity
Contributions may be made in any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters and no more than five Specified Equity Contributions may be made
during the term of the ABL Facility, (b) the amount of any Specified Equity
Contribution shall be no greater than the amount required to cause the
Borrower to be in pro forma compliance with the financial covenant for the
relevant fiscal quarter (c) all Specified Equity Contributions shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining pricing, financial ratio-based
conditions or any baskets with respect to the covenants contained in the ABL
Facility Documentation and (d) there shall be no pro forma reduction in
indebtedness with the proceeds of any Specified Equity Contribution for
determining compliance with the financial covenant.

 



The ABL Credit Documentation will contain a standstill provision with regard
to exercise of remedies (and no borrowings or issuances of Letters of Credit
shall be permitted during the standstill period (without Required ABL Lender
(as defined below) consent)) during the period in which any Specified Equity
Contribution will be made after the receipt of written notice by the ABL
Administrative Agent of the Borrowers intention to cure a financial covenant
default with proceeds of a Specified Equity 

 



A-135

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | Contribution; _provided_ , _however_ , that such standstill
shall be solely with respect to a breach of the financial covenant to which
such Specified Equity Contribution applies. 
   | 
   _Unrestricted Subsidiaries_ : |  | Subject only to no continuing
Specified Event of Default, the Borrower will be permitted to designate (or
re-designate) any existing or subsequently acquired or organized restricted
subsidiary as an "unrestricted subsidiary" and designate (or re-designate)
any such unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary provided only that
(a) no Specified Default exists or would result therefrom and (b) if such
designation or re-designation would result in a reduction in Excess
Availability of 10% or more, the Borrower shall submit an updated Borrowing
Base Certificate at the time the designation or re-designation is made. The
designation of any unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary will be
deemed to be an incurrence at the time of such designation of indebtedness of
such subsidiary or of liens on the assets of such subsidiary, in each case,
outstanding on the date of such designation. The designation of any subsidiary
as an unrestricted subsidiary will constitute an investment in an amount equal
to the fair market value of the subsidiary designated for purposes of the
investments negative covenant. Unrestricted subsidiaries will not be subject
to the representations and warranties, covenants or events of default of the
ABL Loan Documents, the results of operations and indebtedness of
unrestricted subsidiaries will not be taken into account for purposes of
determining any financial ratio or covenant contained in the ABL Loan
Documents and any cash or cash equivalents of any unrestricted
subsidiary will not be taken into account for purposes of any net debt test
under the ABL Loan Documents. Any unrestricted subsidiary must also be
unrestricted under the First Lien Term Facility (or any replacement or
refinancing facilities in respect thereof and in effect at the time of such
designation). 
   | 
   _Events of Default_ : |  | Limited to the following (to be applicable
to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and, in limited circumstances,
Holdings) (subject to certain exceptions limitations and qualifications to be
set forth in the First Lien Term Loan Documents, as well customary additions
relating to the Canadian Loan Parties): nonpayment of principal, interest and
fees (with a five business day grace period for interest and fees); failure to
perform negative covenants, and affirmative covenants to provide notice of

3-business day cure period); failure to comply with the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio (if applicable); failure to comply with the cash management provisions
herein; failure to perform other covenants subject to a 30 day cure period
after the date on which written notice of default from the ABL Administrative
Agent is received; any representation or warranty incorrect in any material
respect when made (with a 30 day cure period (with respect to such breaches of
representations and warranties that are curable and other than the Specified
Representations and the Acquisition Agreement Representations on the Closing
Date) at the end of which such representation or warranty must be accurate in
all material respects); cross-default to continuing defaults under material
indebtedness

    |  | (in excess of a threshold consistent with the ABL
Documentation Principles) of a Loan Party; bankruptcy and similar proceedings;
material monetary judgment defaults in excess of a threshold amount (to be
consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles) against a Loan Party
(to the extent not covered by insurance or other indemnity); invalidity of the
ABL Loan Documents (including any ABL Guarantees), a material security
interest or a material portion of the Collateral; and Change of Control (to
be defined in a manner consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles, but
limited to the "post-IPO" prong); _provided_ that any Default or Event
of Default resulting solely from failure to provide notice thereof shall be
deemed not to be "continuing" or "existing" upon delivery of such notice
unless the Borrower knowingly fails to give timely notice of such Default or
Event of Default as required by the affirmative covenants. 
   | 
   _Voting_ : |  | Amendments and waivers of the ABL Facility
Documentation will require the approval of ABL Lenders holding more than 50%
of the aggregate principal amount of the loans and commitments under the ABL
Facility (the " _Required ABL Lenders_ "), except that (a) the consent of
each ABL Lender directly adversely affected thereby shall be required with
respect to (i) increases in the commitment of such ABL Lender, (ii) reductions
of principal, interest or fees, (iii) changes to the pro rata sharing and pro
rata payment provisions, including the "waterfall" and (iv) extensions of
final maturity or the due date of any interest or fee payment; (b) the consent
of 100% of the Lenders will be required with respect to (i) changes in voting

of the relevant Guarantor permitted by the ABL Loan Documents or other
permitted transaction); (c) the consent of ABL Lenders holding 66.67% of the
aggregate principal amount of the loans and commitments under the ABL
Facility shall be required for amendments increasing advance rates or
availability under the definition of Borrowing Base (and any component
definitions thereof); _provided_ that the foregoing shall not impair
the ability of the ABL Administrative Agent to add, remove, reduce or
increase reserves against the Borrowing Base assets in accordance with the
provisions set forth above; (d) only the consent of the ABL Administrative
Agent, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank will be required to amend,
modify or otherwise affect the rights and duties of the ABL Administrative
Agent, the Swingline Lender and such Issuing Bank, as the case may be. 
   | 
   |  | The ABL Loan Documents will contain provisions consistent with
the ABL Documentation Principles for replacing non-consenting Lenders in
connection with (a) amendments and waivers requiring the consent of all
relevant ABL Lenders or of all relevant ABL Lenders adversely affected thereby
so long as relevant Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate amount of
the loans and commitments under the ABL Facility have consented thereto and
(b) increased costs, taxes, etc. and (c) any Lender who becomes a Disqualified
Lender. 
   | 
   |  | The ABL Loan Documents will contain "amend and extend"
provisions consistent with the ABL Documentation Principles pursuant to which
the 
 



A-137

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | Borrower may extend commitments and/or outstandings pursuant

   | 
   _Assignments and Participations_ : |  | The ABL Lenders will be
permitted to assign loans and commitments (other than to natural persons or
Disqualified Lenders) with the consent of the Borrower (unless a Specified
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or such assignment is an
assignment of a loan or commitment in respect of the ABL Facility to an ABL
Lender or an affiliate of the assigning ABL Lender), the ABL Administrative
Agent, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank, in each case, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each assignment (except
to other ABL Lenders or their affiliates or Approved Funds) will be in a
minimum amount of $5 million. The ABL Administrative Agent will receive a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, payable by the assignor and/or the
assignee, with each assignment, except to the extent such fee is waived by the
ABL Administrative Agent. The identity of Disqualified Lenders will be posted
to all Lenders on the electronic platform. No assignments of the loans or
commitments in respect of the ABL Facility to the Borrower or its affiliates
shall be permitted. 
   | 
   |  |

The ABL Lenders will be permitted to participate loans and commitments to
other people (except Disqualified Lenders to the extent the Disqualified
Lender list is made available to all ABL Lenders). Voting rights of
participants will be limited to matters in respect of (a) increases in
commitments participated to such participant, (b) reductions of principal,
interest (other than default interests) or fees (it being understood and
agreed that the waiver of any mandatory prepayment, default interest, default
or event of default will not require the consent of the participant), (c)
extensions of scheduled amortization, date of payment of interest and any fee
or final maturity and (d) releases of all or substantially all of the
Collateral or all or substantially all of the aggregate value of the ABL

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the ABL Administrative Agent
be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain,
inquire into, monitor or enforce compliance with the provisions hereof
relating to Disqualified Lenders. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the ABL Administrative Agent shall not (x) be obligated to
ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any ABL Lender or participant or
prospective ABL Lender or participant is a Disqualified Lender or (y) have any
liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or

indemnified person arising out of or relating to the ABL Facilities, the use
or proposed use of the proceeds thereof, the Transaction, the ABL Loan

person) that relate to the ABL Loan Documents; _provided_ , that no
indemnified person will be indemnified for its gross negligence, willful
misconduct, bad faith or material breach of the ABL Loan Documents, as

the Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of the Borrower and its
restricted subsidiaries, determined on a pro forma basis, for the four
consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended prior to such date for which
financial statements are internally available.

 



" _Ratio Incremental Amount_ " means such amount as would not result in:



(i) with respect to any Incremental Term Facilities or Incremental
Equivalent Debt secured on a _pari passu_ basis with the First Lien Term
Loans, the Borrowers First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (to be defined in a manner
consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles) for the applicable
Test Period (to be defined in a manner consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles) exceeding (I) the Closing Date First Lien Net
Leverage Ratio or (II) the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to
such incurrence;

 



(ii) with respect to any Incremental Term Facilities or Incremental Equivalent
Debt secured on a junior basis to the First Lien Term Loans, either the
Borrowers Secured Net Leverage Ratio (to be defined in a manner consistent
with the First Lien Documentation Principles) exceeding (I) the Closing Date
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or (II) the Secured Net Leverage Ratio immediately
prior to such incurrence; or 

 



A-141

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |



(iii) with respect to any unsecured Incremental Term Facilities
(or Incremental Equivalent Debt) or secured Incremental Term Facilities (or
Incremental Equivalent Debt) on assets that are not Collateral (as defined
below), either the Borrowers (a) Total Net Leverage Ratio (to be defined in a
manner consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles) exceeding (I)
the Closing Date Total Net Leverage Ratio or (II) the Total Net Leverage Ratio
immediately prior to such incurrence; or (b) the Interest Coverage Ratio (to
be defined in a manner consistent with the First Lien Documentation
Principles) for the applicable Test Period being less than (I) 2.00:1.00 or
(II) the Interest Coverage Ratio immediately prior to such incurrence;

 



in each case, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof and measured as of and for the
Test Period immediately preceding the issuance, incurrence or assumption of
such Indebtedness for which internal financial statements are available, but
excluding the cash proceeds to the Borrower or any such Incremental Facility
for cash netting purposes.



If the Borrower incurs indebtedness under an Incremental Term Facility (or
Incremental Equivalent Debt) using the Fixed Incremental Amount on the same
date that it incurs indebtedness using the Ratio Incremental Amount, the
relevant ratio above will be calculated without regard to any incurrence of
indebtedness under the Fixed Incremental Amount. Unless the Borrower elects
otherwise, each Incremental Term Facility (or Incremental Equivalent Debt)
will be deemed incurred first as Ratio Incremental Amount to the extent
permitted (and calculated prior to giving effect to any simultaneous or
subsequent incurrence of any indebtedness based on a basket or exception that
is not based on a financial ratio, including the (i) Fixed Incremental Amount
or (ii) under the ABL Facility), with any balance incurred under the Fixed
Incremental Amount. The Borrower may classify, and may later reclassify,
indebtedness incurred under an Incremental Term Facility (or Incremental
Equivalent Debt) as incurred as a Fixed Incremental Amount, Ratio Incremental
Amount, or both, on the date of incurrence and thereafter, to the extent
permitted on the date of classification (or the date of any such
reclassification).

 



Incremental Term Facilities may rank _pari passu_ or junior in right of
payment with the Initial Term Loans (as defined below), may either be
unsecured or secured by a permitted lien that is _pari passu_ with or junior
to any liens on such assets securing other First Lien Term Loans and may be
guaranteed by Holdings, the Borrower and/or any restricted subsidiary of the
Borrower that guarantees other First Lien Term Loans.



 

The Incremental Term Facilities will be available at the request of the
Borrower with consent required only from those existing or new lenders that
agree, in their discretion, to participate in such Incremental Term Facility.
Lenders providing a first lien Incremental Term Facility will be reasonably
acceptable to (a) the 

 



A-142

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

Borrower and (b) the First Lien Administrative Agent (but only to the extent
such person would otherwise have a consent right to an assignment of such
loans or commitments to such lender, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The First Lien Term Loan Documents may be
amended as may be necessary to give effect to any Incremental Term Facility
with the consent of the Borrower and lenders providing such Incremental Term
Facility, including such amendments as may be necessary or advisable to have
such facility be fungible with other First Lien Term Facilities.

 



The incurrence of indebtedness under an Incremental Term Facility will be
subject to only the following conditions and to any other conditions agreed
between the lenders under the Incremental Term Facility and the Borrower,
measured at the time of the incurrence of such indebtedness (or the receipt of
commitments with respect thereto), in each case, subject to LCA Election
rights: (a) no event of default will have occurred and be continuing or would
result therefrom, and (b) all representations and warranties must be true and
correct in all material respects immediately prior to, and after giving
effect to, the incurrence of such Incremental Term Facility; _provided_ , that
if such incurrence is in connection with a Permitted Acquisition (to be
defined in a manner consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles),
Acquisition Transaction (to be defined in a manner consistent with the First
Lien Documentation Principles) or other permitted investment or acquisition
(collectively, " _Permitted Investments_ "), the condition set forth in
clause (a) may be waived by the providers of any such Incremental Term
Facility (other than an event of default resulting from non-payment of
principal or interest under the First Lien Term Facilities or bankruptcy
(such events of default, " _Specified Events of Default_ ")) and the condition
set forth in clause (b) may be limited by customary "certain funds"
provisions.

 



The First Lien Term Loan Documents will also require that:

 



(i) except for Incremental Term Facilities incurred pursuant to the Inside
Maturity Date Basket (as defined below), the scheduled final maturity date of
any Incremental Term Facility be no earlier than the final maturity date for
the First Lien Term Loans incurred on the Closing Date (the " _Initial Term
Loans_ ");

 



(ii) except for Incremental Term Facilities incurred pursuant to the Inside
Maturity Date Basket, the weighted average life to maturity of any
Incremental Term Facility be no shorter than the remaining weighted average
life to maturity of the Initial Term Loans (without giving effect to any
amortization or prepayments on the outstanding First Lien Term Loans);



(iii) the interest margins for any Incremental Term Facility will be
determined by the Borrower and the lenders of such Incremental Term Facility;
_provided_ , that if the interest rate margins for any floating-rate
Incremental Term Facility (other than an Excluded Incremental Facility)
that is secured on a _pari passu_ basis with any 

 



A-143

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

other First Lien Term Facilities is greater than the interest rate margins for
the Initial Term Loans by more than 75 basis points (the " _Yield
Differential_ "), then the interest margins for all Initial Term Loans
denominated in such currency will be increased to the extent necessary so that
such all-in-yield for such Incremental Term Facility is not more than 75
basis points higher than the interest rate margins for the Initial Term Loans
(the "MFN Provision");



(iv) except for Incremental Term Facilities incurred pursuant to the Inside
Maturity Date Basket, any Incremental Term Facility may share on a _pro rata_
basis or less than a _pro rata_ basis in any mandatory prepayments of the
Initial Term Loans (other than pursuant to a refinancing or with respect
to greater than _pro rata_ payments to an earlier maturing tranche);



(v) (i) to the extent secured, shall not be secured by any lien on any asset
for the Borrower or any Guarantor that does not also secure the existing First
Lien Term Facility and (ii) shall not be guaranteed by any person other than
the Borrower and Guarantors; and



(vi) any Incremental Term facility will be on terms and pursuant
to documentation to be determined by the Borrower and the providers of such
Incremental Term Facility; provided that the operation and agency provisions
application to each first lien Incremental Term Facility will be reasonably
satisfactory to the First Lien Administrative Agent.



" _Excluded Incremental Facility_ " means any Incremental Facility or
Incremental Equivalent Debt (a) incurred after the date that is six months
after the initial funding of the Initial Term Loans, (b) in an original
aggregate principal amount less than the greater of 50% of Closing Date
EBITDA and 50% of LTM Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, (c) in connection with
Permitted Investments, (d) incurred in reliance on, or reclassified to, the
Ratio Incremental Amount, (e) with a final maturity date later than the date
that is eight years after the Closing Date, (f) that is not a syndicated "term
loan b" facility or (g) not denominated in US Dollars.



 

" _Inside Maturity Date Basket_ " means any Incremental Term Facility or
Incremental Equivalent Debt that is designated by the Borrower as
being incurred pursuant to this provision; _provided_ that such Incremental
Term Facility is (a) in an original aggregate principal amount that does not
exceed the greater of 100% of Closing Date EBITDA and 100% of LTM Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA measured on a pro forma basis, (b) incurred under (or
reclassified to) the Ratio Incremental Amount or (c) not a syndicated "term
loan b" facility.



 

In lieu of adding Incremental Term Facilities as set forth above, all or any
part of the Incremental Facility Cap may be used to incur (i) notes
and/or loans that will be secured by liens on the Collateral that have the
same priority as the liens that secure the First Lien Term Facilities ("
_Parity Lien Debt_ ") and other permitted liens, 

 



A-144

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

(ii) notes and/or loans that will be secured by liens on the Collateral that
are junior in priority to the liens that secure the First Lien Term
Facilities (" _Junior Lien Debt_ ") and other permitted liens, (iii) notes
and/or loans that will be secured by liens on assets that do not constitute
Collateral (" _Non-Collateral Debt_"), and/or (iv) unsecured notes or loans
(" _Unsecured Debt_ " and, together with Parity Lien Debt, Junior Lien Debt
and Non-Collateral Debt, " _Incremental Equivalent Debt_ "); _provided_ ,
that,



 

(a) Incremental Equivalent Debt together with all Incremental Term Facilities
will be capped at the Incremental Facility Cap;



 

(b) except for Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred pursuant to the Inside
Maturity Date Basket, the scheduled final maturity date of any Incremental
Equivalent Debt incurred as term loan facilities that is secured on a _pari
passu_ basis with the First Lien Term Facilities will be no earlier than the
final maturity date for the Initial Term Loans;



(c) except for Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred pursuant to the Inside
Maturity Date Basket, the weighted average life to maturity of any Incremental
Equivalent Debt incurred as term loan facilities will be no shorter than the
remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Initial Term Loans
(without giving effect to any amortization or prepayments on the outstanding
First Lien Term Loans);



 

(d) except for Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred pursuant to the Inside
Maturity Date Basket, any Incremental Equivalent Debt may share on a _pro
rata_ basis or less than a _pro rata_ basis in any mandatory prepayments of
the Initial Term Loans (other than pursuant to a refinancing or with respect
to greater than _pro rata_  payments to an earlier maturing tranche) and any
mandatory prepayments of any Junior Lien Debt or Unsecured Debt may not be
made except to the extent that prepayments are offered, to the extent required
under the First Lien Term Facilities or any indebtedness secured on a _pari
passu_ basis with the First Lien Term Facilities, first _pro rata_ to the
First Lien Term Facilities and any such other _pari passu_ indebtedness;

 



(e) no Incremental Equivalent Debt will be subject to any "most favored
nations" pricing provisions; _provided_ that Parity Lien Debt in the form of
floating-rate term loans will be subject to the MFN Provision;

 



(f) (i) to the extent secured by the assets of any Loan party, shall not be
secured by any lien on any asset of any Borrower or any Guarantor that does
not also secure the existing First Lien Term Facility and (ii) to the extent
incurred or guaranteed by any Loan Party, shall not be guarantee by any
person other than the Borrower and Guarantors. 

 



A-145

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |



(g) any Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred by non-Loan Parties shall be
capped at greater of 50% of closing EBITDA and 50% LTM Consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA (combined with the cap for Permitted Ratio Debt incurred by non-Loan
Parties). 

   | 
   _Refinancing Facilities_ : |  | The Borrower and the restricted
subsidiaries may refinance loans and commitments under any First Lien Term
Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis, from time to time, in whole or part,
with one or more tranches of secured or unsecured indebtedness (such
indebtedness, a " _Refinancing Facility_ "), in each case, on terms and
conditions consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles;
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, liens securing a Refinancing
Facility must be permitted liens. 
   | 
   _Purpose_ : |  | Proceeds of First Lien Term Loans, together with the
proceeds of any loans borrowed under the ABL Facility on the Closing Date and
the proceeds of the Equity Contribution will be used to consummate the
Refinancing and to pay Transaction Costs, with any remainder available for
general corporate purposes. 
   | 
   _Availability_ : |  | The First Lien Term Facility must be drawn in a
single drawing substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Transactions. Amounts repaid or prepaid under the First Lien Term Facilities
may not be reborrowed. 
   | 
   _First Lien Documentation Principles_ : |  | The definitive
documentation for the First Lien Term Facility (the " _First Lien Loan
Documents_ ") will (a) be initially prepared by counsel to the Borrower, (b)
contain only the terms and conditions set forth in this Exhibit C (subject to
the "flex" in the Fee Letter), (c) reflect the operational and strategic
requirements of the Borrower and its subsidiaries in light of their
consolidated capital structure, size, geographic location, businesses and
business practices, operations, financial accounting, matters disclosed in the
Acquisition Agreement and the proposed business plan (including the Sponsor
Model (as defined below) and investment thesis) and the industry
and practices of Borrower, in each case, after giving effect to the
Transactions, (d) be consistent with the proposed business plan, Sponsor Model
and projections, in each case delivered to the Commitment Parties prior to the
date of the Commitment Letter, (e) be based on, and no less favorable (except
as expressly set forth in this Term Sheet (after giving effect to any "flex"
exercised under the Fee Letter)) to, the Acquired Business and its
subsidiaries than, the draft documentation dated as of February 25, 2020
previously provided to you titled "First Lien Credit Agreement" by and among
Karman Intermediate Corp. as Holdings, Advantages Sales and Marketing Inc. as
the Borrower (the " _Identified Precedent_ "), (f) will permit automatic
reclassification of amounts incurred under all fixed baskets, exceptions and
thresholds under applicable ratio baskets, and (g) in no event be less
favorable (taken as a whole) to the Borrower and its subsidiaries than the
existing credit agreement of the Acquired Business; _provided_ , the First
Lien Loan Documents will be modified as necessary (i) (x) to take into account
any changes 
 



A-146

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

in law or accounting standards and (y) to reflect customary modifications to
the operational and agency provisions to reflect the requirements of the
First Lien Administrative Agent and (ii) to reflect customary provisions
relating to the Canadian Loan Parties. The foregoing is referred to herein,
collectively, as the " _First Lien_ _Documentation Principles_ " and,
together with the ABL Documentation Principles, the " _Documentation
Principles_." Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Term Sheet have
the meanings set forth on the exhibit to the Commitment Letter to which this
Term Sheet is attached entitled "Select Definitions", in the Identified
Precedent or in the Fee Letter, as applicable. The First Lien Loan Documents
will, subject to the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter, contain
only those payment provisions, conditions to borrowing, mandatory prepayments,
representations and warranties, covenants, events of default and guarantee and
collateral provisions expressly set forth in this Term Sheet, in each
case, applicable to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (and to the
extent set forth below, Holdings) and with standards, qualifications,
thresholds, exceptions, "baskets" and grace and cure periods set forth in the
Identified Precedent and otherwise consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles.



For purposes of the First Lien Loan Documents, if any "market flex"
provisions are exercised, whether before or after the Closing Date, the
applicable incurrence based covenant levels based on leverage shall be
adjusted in the First Lien Loan Documents (or pursuant to an amendment
thereto, which shall require only the consent of the Borrower and the First
Lien Administrative Agent) in order to make corresponding adjustments to
account for the additional indebtedness and any OID or upfront fees and to
maintain the agreed cushions and/or reflect the adjusted "Closing Date"
leverage levels (or offset thereto) resulting from the exercise of such
"market flex" terms. 

   | 
   _Ranking_ : |  | The First Lien Term Facilities will be senior
obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors (as defined below) and will be
secured (i) on a first priority basis with the Fixed Asset Collateral (as
defined in _Exhibit B_ ) and (ii) on a second priority basis with the Current
Asset Collateral (as defined in _Exhibit B_ ), in each case subject to
permitted liens. The lien priority, relative rights and other creditors
rights in respect of the Collateral securing the ABL Facility and the First
Lien Term Facilities will be set forth in one or more Intercreditor Agreements
(as defined in Exhibit B), which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Borrower, the First Lien Administrative Agent, the administrative agent under
the ABL Facility. For the avoidance of doubt, the Intercreditor Agreements
will (i) permit additional secured indebtedness of the Loan Parties (as
defined below), which indebtedness is permitted to be incurred and secured
(including with respect to the lien priority thereof) pursuant to the terms of
the definitive documentation for the ABL Facility (the " _ABL Loan Documents_
") and the First Lien Term Loan Documents, (ii) permit
refinancing indebtedness in respect of the ABL Facility and the First Lien 
 



A-147

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | Term Facilities or any of the foregoing permitted additional
secured indebtedness referenced in clause (i), (iii) not impose any
restrictions on amendments of the ABL Loan Documents or the First Lien Term
Loan Documents (other than amendments which would conflict with the
Intercreditor Agreements) and (iv) otherwise contain usual and customary terms
reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and the other secured parties party
thereto. 
   | 
   _Interest Rates and Fees_ : |  | As set forth on _Annex II_ to the
Fee Letter. 
   | 
   _Maturity and Amortization_ : |  | The First Lien Term Facilities
will mature on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date (subject to
extension with the consent of only the extending First Lien Lender) and will
amortize in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original
principal amount of the First Lien Term Facility during each year of the First
Lien Term Facility (such payments subject to reduction as provided herein and
as may be provided in the First Lien Term Loan Documents), with the balance
of the original principal amount of the First Lien Term Facility payable at
maturity; _provided_ that amortization of the First Lien Term Facility may be
adjusted (but may not be decreased) in connection with any Incremental
Term Facility in the form of an increase to the First Lien Term Facility from
and after the first fiscal quarter ending after the applicable date of drawing
or the loans under such Incremental Term Facility (with the appropriate
adjustments as may be necessary to cause the loans under any such Incremental
Term Facility that is secured by the Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis with
the First Lien Term Facilities (a " _Parity Incremental Term Facility_ ") to
be treated as the same class as loans under the First Lien Term Facility and
to permit "fungibility" with the First Lien Term Facility to the extent
practicable). Amortization will commence at the end of the first full fiscal
quarter ending after the Closing Date. 
   | 
   _Guarantees_ : |  | All obligations of the Borrower under the First
Lien Term Facilities and of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries under
certain interest rate protection or other hedging arrangements (including with
respect to currency) entered into with a person that is the First Lien
Administrative Agent or a First Lien Lender or any affiliate of the First Lien
Administrative Agent or a First Lien Lender at the time of entering into such
arrangements (collectively, the " _Hedging Arrangements_ ") and certain cash
management arrangements entered into with a person that is the First Lien
Administrative Agent or a First Lien Lender or any affiliate of any the First
Lien Administrative Agent or a First Lien Lender at the time of entering into
such arrangements (collectively, the " _Cash Management Arrangements_ " and,
together with the Hedging Arrangements, the " _Secured Agreements_ "), will be
unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior secured basis
(the " _First Lien Guarantees_ ") by Holdings and each existing and
subsequently acquired or organized wholly-owned material U.S. and Canadian
domestic subsidiary of the Borrower, 
 



A-148

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | subject to the First Lien Documentation Principles and other
than Excluded Subsidiaries (the " _Subsidiary Guarantors_ " and, together with
Holdings, the " _Guarantors_ " and the Guarantors together with the Borrower,
the " _Loan Parties_ "). Neither the Acquired Business nor any of its
subsidiaries will be Loan Parties prior to the consummation of the Acquisition
and the initial funding of the Facilities. The First Lien Term
Facility Documentation will provide that the term "FSHCO" means any direct or
indirect subsidiary of Holdings that has no material assets other than equity
interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more non-U.S.
subsidiaries of the Borrower (other than Canadian subsidiaries) that are
"controlled foreign corporations" within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the
Code or other FSHCOs. Neither the Acquired Business nor any of its
subsidiaries will be Loan Parties prior to the consummation of the Acquisition
and the initial funding of the Facilities. 
   | 
   _Security_ : |  | Subject to the Certain Funds Provisions, the
obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of the First Lien Term Facility,
the First Lien Guarantees and the Secured Agreements will be secured jointly
and severally (subject to permitted liens) by the Collateral (as defined in
_Exhibit B_ ), with the priority as set forth under the heading "Ranking"
above and on terms and conditions (including as to exceptions, grace periods,
limitations and materiality thresholds) the same as those set forth in the
Identified Precedent in accordance with the First Lien Documentation
Principles and the Security Agreement (as defined in the Identified
Precedent). 
   | 
   _Mandatory Prepayments_ : |  | Loans under the First Lien Term
Facilities will be prepaid with: 
   | 
   |  |

(a) _Excess Cash Flow:_ 50% (with step-downs to 25% and 0% based on achieving
reductions to the Closing Date First Lien Net Leverage Ratio of 0.50x and
1.00x, respectively) of the Borrowers annual Excess Cash Flow (to be defined
in a manner consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles),
commencing with the first full fiscal year ending after the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that (i) voluntary prepayments (including those made through debt
buybacks made by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries in an amount
equal to the discounted amount actually paid in respect of such debt buyback
and payments utilizing the yank-a-bank provisions (to the extent such debt is
retired instead of assigned)) of the First Lien Term Loans and other
indebtedness that is secured on a _pari passu_ basis to the First Lien Term
Loans, and indebtedness that is unsecured or secured on a junior basis to the
First Lien Term Loans, loans under the ABL Facility or any other revolving
facility (to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction of the
corresponding commitment) (without duplication of amount that have already
reduced Excess Cash Flow) made during such fiscal year (or, without
duplication, after the end of such fiscal year but prior to the date of any
Excess Cash Flow payment), will reduce the amount of Excess Cash Flow
prepayments required for such fiscal year on a 

 



A-149

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

dollar-for-dollar basis (other than to the extent such prepayments are funded
with the proceeds of long-term indebtedness) and (ii) the amount of Excess
Cash Flow prepayments required for such fiscal year will be reduced by, on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, cash used for capital expenditures, Permitted
Investments and restricted payments (other than those funded in reliance on
the Available Amount Basket and certain other exceptions consistent with the
First Lien Documentation Principles) (including without limitation, at the
election of Borrower, for any amounts planned to be paid in the immediately
succeeding fiscal year), in each case, other than to the extent funded
with long-term indebtedness, and made during such fiscal year and, at the
option of the Borrower, made prior to the date of such Excess Cash Flow
prepayment (and to any subsequent fiscal year to the extent the amount of such
prepayments exceed the amount of prepayments required to be made from Excess
Cash Flow for such year, when taken together with any other payments required
for such year, but without duplication in any other Excess Cash Flow period)
or committed to be made during such fiscal year or prior to the date of such
Excess Cash Flow prepayment and (iii) excess cash flow sweeps shall be limited
to amounts in excess of a threshold amount consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles (and limited to such excess amounts);  _provided_ ,
for purposes of determining the applicable Excess Cash Flow percentage above,
the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated to give pro forma effect
to all such prepayments and expenditures that are made after the end of
the applicable fiscal year but prior to the making of such Excess Cash Flow
prepayment. 

   | 
   |  |

(b) _Certain Asset Sales:_ 100% of the net cash proceeds of sales or other
dispositions of Collateral and certain casualty events with respect to
Collateral (subject to step-downs to 50% and 0% based on First Lien Net
Leverage Ratios of 0.50x and 1.00x inside the Closing Date First Lien Net
Leverage Ratio (the " _Asset Sale Stepdowns_ ")) by the Loan Parties pursuant
to the General Asset Sale Basket (as defined below) (including insurance and
condemnation proceeds but with exceptions for ordinary course dispositions,
dispositions of obsolete or worn-out property and property no longer used or
useful in the business and other exceptions consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles) in excess of a threshold amount per transaction
or series of related transactions consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles (and limited to such excess amounts) and subject to
the right of the Borrower to reinvest if such proceeds are reinvested (or
committed to be reinvested) in assets used or useful in the business of the
Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries within 18 months and, if so
committed to be reinvested, reinvested no later than 180 days after the end of
such 18-month period. 

 



A-150

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

(c) _Certain Debt Proceeds:_ 100% of the net cash proceeds of issuances of
debt obligations of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries after the
Closing Date (excluding debt permitted under the First Lien Term Loan
Documents, but including Refinancing Facilities). 

   | 
   |  |

Mandatory prepayments pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) will be subject to
customary limitations with respect to repatriation from non-U.S. subsidiaries
to be set forth in the First Lien Term Loan Documents. Each First Lien Term
Facility Lender will have the right to reject its _pro rata_ share of any
mandatory prepayment, in which case the amounts so rejected may be retained
by the Borrower (with no obligation to repay such loans in the future).

Mandatory prepayments pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) will be subject to
limitations consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles to the
extent required to be made from cash at non-U.S. subsidiaries, the
repatriation of which would result in material adverse tax consequences (as
determined by the Borrower in consultation with the First Lien Administrative
Agent) or would be prohibited or restricted by applicable law. Each First Lien
Term Facility Lender will have the right to reject its _pro rata_ share of
any mandatory prepayment (any such rejected mandatory prepayment amounts, the
" _Declined Amounts_ "), in which case the amounts so rejected may be retained
by the Borrower (with no obligation to repay such loans in the future). 

   | 
   |  | The above described mandatory prepayments will be applied on a
_pro rata_ basis to the First Lien Term Facilities and to any Incremental Term
Facility that is secured by liens which are _pari passu_ with the liens
securing the First Lien Term Facilities and require such a prepayment (or a
less than _pro rata_ basis if permitted by such Incremental Term Facility) and
to the installments thereof as directed by the Borrower (or, absent such
direction, in direct order of maturity of the remaining installments under
the First Lien Term Facilities and any such Incremental Term Facility);
_provided_ , that the First Lien Term Loan Documents will provide that in the
case of mandatory prepayments in respect of Excess Cash Flow or any asset
sale or condemnation event, a ratable portion of the net proceeds thereof may
be applied to prepay or offer to purchase Parity Lien Debt, if required under
the terms of such debt. 
   | 
   _Voluntary Prepayments/Reductions in Commitments_ : |  | Voluntary
prepayments of borrowings under the First Lien Term Facilities will be
permitted at any time, without premium or penalty (other than, with respect to
the Initial Term Loans, any applicable Repricing Premium referred to below)
subject to reimbursement of the First Lien Lenders redeployment costs
actually incurred in the case of a prepayment of Adjusted LIBOR (as defined
below) loans other than on the last day of the relevant interest period. 
   | 
   |  | All voluntary prepayments under the First Lien Term Facilities
shall be applied as directed by the Borrower. 
 



A-151

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    _Repricing Premium_ : |  |

In the event of a Repricing Transaction (as defined below) with respect to all
or any portion of the Initial Term Loans prior to the six month anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Borrower will pay a prepayment premium of 1.00% (a "
_Repricing Premium_ ") on the principal amount of such Initial Term Loans
prepaid, repaid or refinanced or, in the case of any amendment, the principal
amount of the relevant loans outstanding immediately prior to such amendment
or subject to a mandatory assignment in connection with such amendment.



 

The term " _Repricing Transaction_ " means (a) the incurrence by the Borrower
or any other Loan Party of indebtedness in the form of a syndicated term loan
(including any new or additional First Lien Term Loans, whether incurred
directly or by way of the conversion of the initial First Lien Term Loans into
a new tranche of replacement First Lien Term Loans) (i) having an all-in yield
that is less than the all-in yield for the initial First Lien Term Loans and
(ii) the proceeds of which are used to prepay (or, in the case of a
conversion, deemed to prepay or replace), in whole or in part, the

without limitation.

 



Compliance with a negative covenant in the First Lien Term Loan Documents may
be permitted in part by one basket or exception (including the Fixed
Incremental Amount and Ratio Incremental Amount) and in part by another, in
the Borrowers discretion, and the Borrower may designate and redesignate (on
or after any applicable date) the baskets or exceptions available to it on
such date (or any later date) upon which compliance is based. Unless the
Borrower elects otherwise, compliance will be deemed to be first pursuant to a
basket or exception based on a financial ratio (to the maximum extent
permitted by such basket or exception) prior to being determined to pursuant
to any other basket or exception, including those based on a fixed dollar
amount. Agents will execute intercreditor agreements upon request. 

 



A-157

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |



The First Lien Term Loan Documents will contain "limited condition
transaction" provisions consistent with the First Lien Documentation
Principles, which will allow the Borrower to elect (an " _LCA Election_ ," and
the date of such election, an " _LCA_ _Election Date_ ") to test compliance
with any ratio, accuracy of representation, absence of default or event of
default or other condition precedent in connection with a Permitted Investment
as of the date of execution of a definitive agreement for such Permitted
Investment. Indebtedness under revolving, delayed draw and other committed
facilities may be incurred from time to time if the full amount of such
facility was permitted to be incurred on the date commitments with respect to
such facilities were obtained (and compliance will not need to be tested on
any subsequent date). 

   | 
   |  | " _Available Amount_ " will mean a cumulative amount equal to
(a) the greater of 25% of Closing Date EBITDA and 25% of LTM Consolidated
Adjusted EBITDA, plus (b) 50% of cumulative positive Consolidated Net
Income (to be defined in the First Lien Term Loan Documents), plus (c) the
cash, cash equivalent or other asset proceeds of permitted equity (other than
Specified Equity Contributions (to be defined in the First Lien Term Loan
Documents) and contributions used to incur indebtedness or pursuant to other
basket capacity) issuances of the Borrower or any parent of the Borrower that
are contributed to the Borrower as equity, plus (d) the investments of the
Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries in any unrestricted subsidiary that
has been re-designated as a restricted subsidiary or that has been merged or
consolidated with or into the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries
(up to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of such investments of the
Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries in such unrestricted subsidiary at
the time of such re-designation or merger or consolidation and (ii) the fair
market value of such investments by the Borrower and its restricted
subsidiaries in such unrestricted subsidiary at the time they were made), plus
(e) returns, profits, distributions and similar amounts received in cash or
cash equivalents by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries on
investments made using the Available Amount not in excess of such investments
at the time they were made, plus (f) any mandatory prepayment amount declined
by a declining lender (subject to any other applicable mandatory prepayment
requirement), plus (g) the portion of any asset sale proceeds not required to
applied to prepay the loans as a result of the Asset Sale Stepdowns plus (h)
amounts received by the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries in
cash from the sale of the equity interests of any minority investment or
unrestricted subsidiary or any dividend or other distribution received from
any minority investment or unrestricted subsidiary, in each case, where the
original investment was made in reliance on the Available Amount. 
   | 
   _Financial Covenant_ : |  | None. 
 



A-158

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    _Unrestricted Subsidiaries_ : |  | Subject only to no continuing
Specified Event of Default, the Borrower will be permitted to designate (or
re-designate) any existing or subsequently acquired or organized restricted
subsidiary as an "unrestricted subsidiary" and designate (or re-designate)
any such unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary provided only that
no Specified Event of Default exists or would result therefrom. The
designation of any unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary will be
deemed to be an incurrence at the time of such designation of indebtedness of
such subsidiary or of liens on the assets of such subsidiary, in each
case, outstanding on the date of such designation. The designation of any
subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary will constitute an investment in an
amount equal to the fair market value of the subsidiary designated for
purposes of the investments negative covenant. Unrestricted subsidiaries will
not be subject to the representations and warranties, covenants or events of
default of the First Lien Term Loan Documents, the results of operations and
indebtedness of unrestricted subsidiaries will not be taken into account for
purposes of determining any financial ratio or covenant contained in the First
Lien Term Loan Documents and any cash or cash equivalents of any unrestricted
subsidiary will not be taken into account for purposes of any net debt test
under the First Lien Term Loan Documents. Any unrestricted subsidiary must
also be unrestricted under the ABL Facility (or any replacement or refinancing
facilities in respect thereof and in effect at the time of such designation). 
   | 
   _Events of Default_ : |  | Limited to the following (to be applicable
to the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and, in limited circumstances,
Holdings) (subject to certain exceptions limitations and qualifications to be
set forth in the First Lien Term Loan Documents, as well as customary
additions relating to the Canadian Loan Parties): nonpayment of principal,
interest and fees (with a five business day grace period for interest and
fees); failure to perform negative covenants, and affirmative covenants to
provide notice of default or maintain the Borrowers corporate existence;
failure to perform other covenants subject to a 30 day cure period after the
date on which written notice of default from the First Lien Administrative
Agent is received; any representation or warranty incorrect in any material
respect when made (with a 30 day cure period (with respect to such breaches of
representations and warranties that are curable and other than the Specified
Representations and the Acquisition Agreement Representations on the Closing
Date) at the end of which such representation or warranty must be accurate in
all material respects); cross-default to continuing defaults under material
indebtedness (in excess of a threshold consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles) of a Loan Party; bankruptcy and similar proceedings;
material monetary judgment defaults in excess of a threshold amount (to be
consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles) against a Loan Party
(to the extent not covered by insurance or other indemnity); invalidity of the
First Lien Term Loan Documents (including any First Lien 
 



A-159

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | Guarantees), a material security interest or a material
portion of the Collateral; and Change of Control (to be defined in a manner
consistent with the First Lien Documentation Principles but limited to the
"post-IPO" prong); _provided_ that any Default or Event of Default resulting
solely from failure to provide notice thereof shall be deemed not to be
"continuing" or "existing" upon delivery of such notice unless the Borrower
knowingly fails to give timely notice of such Default or Event of Default as
required by the affirmative covenants. 
   | 
   |  | Notwithstanding the foregoing, a breach of a financial
maintenance covenant in the ABL Facility will not constitute an Event of
Default with respect to the First Lien Term Facilities or trigger a cross-
default under the First Lien Term Facilities until the date on which the
loans under the ABL Facility (if any) have been accelerated and the
commitments in respect of the ABL Facility have been terminated, in each case,
in accordance with the terms of the ABL Facility. 
   | 
   _Voting_ : |  |

Amendments and waivers of the First Lien Term Loan Documents will require the
approval of one or more First Lien Lenders (the " _Required Lenders_ ")
holding more than 50% of the aggregate amount of loans and commitments under
the First Lien Term Facilities, except that: (a) the consent of each First
Lien Lender directly and adversely affected thereby will be required with
respect to (i) increases in commitments of such First Lien Lender, (ii)
reductions of principal, interest (other than default interest) or fees (it
being understood and agreed that the waiver of any mandatory prepayment,
default interest, default or event of default will only require the consent of
the Required Lenders), (iii) extensions of scheduled amortization, date of
payment of interest or any fee or final maturity, and (iv) changes to the pro
rata sharing and pro rata payment provisions, including the "waterfall"
provisions; (b) the consent of 100% of the First Lien Lenders will be required
with respect to amendments that effect (i) changes in voting thresholds and
(ii) releases of liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral or all or
substantially all of the aggregate value of the First Lien Guarantees; and (c)
the consent of the First Lien Administrative Agent will be required to
amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights and duties of the First Lien
Administrative Agent; _provided_ that, if a Lender (subject to certain
exceptions to be set forth in the First Lien Term Loan Documents) has a net
short TRS, CDS or other derivatives hedging position with respect to the
Borrower and/or any other Loan Party, the ability of the "net short lenders"
to vote will be limited in a manner consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles.

 



Notwithstanding the foregoing, amendments and waivers that affect only the
First Lien Lenders under a particular facility or tranche, will require only
the consent of First Lien Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate
commitments and loans under such facility or tranche, as applicable. 

 



A-160

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  | The First Lien Term Loan Documents will contain provisions for
replacing (a) non-consenting First Lien Lenders in connection with amendments
and waivers requiring the consent of all relevant First Lien Lenders or of
all relevant First Lien Lenders adversely affected thereby so long as relevant
First Lien Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate amount of the loans
and commitments under the relevant First Lien Facilities have consented
thereto, (b) First Lien Lenders that make a claim for increased costs, taxes,
etc. and (c) any First Lien Lender that is or becomes a Disqualified Lender
(to be defined in the First Lien Term Loan Documents). 
   | 
   |  |

The First Lien Term Loan Documents will contain "amend and extend" and
"refinancing" provisions pursuant to which the Borrower may refinance or
extend commitments and/or outstandings pursuant to one or more tranches with
only the consent of the respective extending or refinancing lenders _provided_
, that no existing First Lien Lender will have any obligation to commit to
any such extension or refinancing.



The First Lien Term Loan Documents will permit amendments thereof without the
approval or consent of the First Lien Lenders to effect a Repricing
Transaction other than any First Lien Lender holding First Lien Term Loans
subject to such Repricing Transaction that will continue as a First Lien
Lender in respect of the repriced tranche of First Lien Term Loans or modified
First Lien Term Loans.



 

Non-pro-rata distributions and commitment reductions will be permitted
in connection with loan buy-back or similar programs consistent with the
First Lien Documentation Principles. 

   | 
   _Yield Protection and Increased Costs_ : |  | Consistent with the
First Lien Documentation Principles, including customary tax gross-up
provisions and customary protections for increased costs imposed as a result
of the Dodd-Frank Act or Basel III. 
   | 
   _Defaulting Lenders_ : |  | Consistent with the First Lien
Documentation Principles. At the Borrowers option, the Borrower may prepay
the loans and/or terminate the commitments of any defaulting lender without
penalty or premium. 
   | 
   _Assignments and Participations_ : |  | The First Lien Lenders will
be permitted to assign loans and commitments (other than to natural persons,
Disqualified Lenders or First Lien Lenders who have become Disqualified
Lenders) with the consent of the Borrower (unless a Specified Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing or such assignment is an assignment of
a First Lien Term Loan to a Lender, an affiliate of a Lender or an approved
fund), the First Lien Administrative Agent, in each case such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Borrower will be deemed to have
consented if it has not responded within five (5) business days after written
request for consent to an assignment of First Lien Term Loans. Each assignment
(except to other First Lien Lenders or their affiliates or approved funds)
will be in a minimum amount of $1.0 million. The First Lien Administrative
Agent will receive a processing and 
 



A-161

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

recordation fee of $3,500, payable by the assignor and/or the assignee, with
each assignment. The First Lien Administrative Agent will make the list of
Disqualified Lenders available to a First Lien Lender upon request by such
First Lien Lender.



 

Assignments of Loans (including under Incremental Facilities) to the Sponsors
and their affiliates (other than Holdings and its subsidiaries) (each, an "
_Affiliated Lender_ ") will be permitted (a) on a non- _pro rata_ basis
through open market purchases and/or (b) through Dutch auctions open to all
First Lien Lenders on a _pro rata_ basis in accordance with customary
procedures, subject to the following limitations:



 

(a) for purposes of any amendment, waiver or modification of the First Lien
Term Loan Documents that does not require the consent of each First Lien
Lender or each affected First Lien Lender or does not adversely affect such
Affiliated Lender in its capacity as such in any material respect as compared
to other First Lien Lenders and for purposes of any bankruptcy plan of
reorganization, Affiliated Lenders will be deemed to have voted in the same
proportion as non-affiliated First Lien Lenders voting on such matter;

 



(b) Affiliated Lenders will not be permitted to attend/participate in
conference calls or meetings attended solely by the First Lien Lenders and the
First Lien Administrative Agent, or to receive information provided solely to
the First Lien Lenders or to receive the advice of counsel to the First Lien
Administrative Agent or the First Lien Lenders, nor may Affiliated Lenders
challenge the attorney-client privilege between the First Lien Administrative
Agent and counsel to the First Lien Administrative Agent or between the First
Lien Lenders and counsel to the First Lien Lenders; and



 

(c) loans owned or held by the Affiliated Lenders must not, in the aggregate
for all such persons, exceed 25% of the aggregate amount of loans under the
First Lien Term Facilities and any Incremental Term Facility, as the case may
be, outstanding at the time of assignment or purchase.

 



_provided_ , that a Debt Fund Affiliate (as defined below) will not be subject
to the foregoing limitations described in clauses (a) through (c) above;
_provided_ , _further_ , that all loans held by Debt Fund Affiliates may not
account for more than 49.9% of the loans of consenting First Lien Lenders
included in determining whether Required Lenders have consented to any
amendment, modification, waiver or any other action with respect to any of the
terms of, or otherwise have acted on any manner with respect to, the First
Lien Term Loan Documents.

 



The First Lien Term Loan Documents will provide that assignments of loans
under the First Lien Term Facilities to Holdings or any of its subsidiaries
will be permitted through (a) open-market purchases on a non- _pro rata_ basis
and/or (b) Dutch auctions open to all First Lien Lenders on a _pro rata_ basis
in accordance with customary procedures, in each case so long as (i) 

 



A-162

            |  | 
---|---|--- 
    |  |

no event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result after
giving effect to any such assignment pursuant to clause (b); (ii) the loans
purchased are automatically and immediately cancelled; and (iii) no proceeds
from any loan under the ABL Facility shall be used to purchase term loans
unless on a pro forma basis for such purchase the Payment Conditions (as
defined in the ABL Loan Documents) are met. 

   | 
   |  |

The First Lien Lenders will be permitted to participate loans and commitments
to other people (except Disqualified Lenders). Voting rights of participants
will be limited to matters in respect of (a) increases in commitments
participated to such participant, (b) reductions of principal, interest (other
than default interests) or fees (it being understood and agreed that
the waiver of any mandatory prepayment, default interest, default or event of
default will not require the consent of the participant), and (c) extensions
of scheduled amortization, date of payment of interest and any fee or final
maturity and (d) releases of all or substantially all of the Collateral or
all or substantially all of the aggregate value of the First Lien Guarantees
(other than in connection with any transfer or sale of Collateral or of the
relevant Guarantor or any other transaction permitted by the First Lien Term
Loan Documents).



Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the First Lien Administrative
Agent be responsible or have any liability for, or have any duty to ascertain,

reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
exchange of shares or other similar event, or such Award is settled for cash
(in whole or in part) (including Shares repurchased by the Company under
Section 7.4 at the same price paid by the Holder), the Shares subject to
such Award shall, to the extent of such forfeiture, expiration, conversion or
cash settlement, again be available for future grants of Awards under the

stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used
for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for grant
under the Plan; _provided_ that Awards using such available Shares shall not
be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms

the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to such acquisition or
combination.

voluntary and nothing in the Plan or any Program shall be construed as
mandating that any Eligible Individual or other Person shall participate in
the Plan.

4.2 _Award Agreement_. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement
that sets forth the terms, conditions and limitations for such Award as
determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion (consistent with the
requirements of the Plan and any applicable Program). Award Agreements
evidencing Incentive Stock Options shall contain such terms and conditions as
may be necessary to meet the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code.

4.3 _Limitations Applicable to Section_ __ _ 16 Persons_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Plan, the Plan, and any Award granted or awarded to
any individual who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, shall be
subject to any additional limitations set forth in any applicable exemptive
rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act (including Rule 16b-3 of the
Exchange Act and any amendments thereto) that are requirements for the
application of such exemptive rule. To the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended
to the extent necessary to conform to such applicable exemptive rule.

 

4.4 _At-Will Service_. Nothing in the Plan or in any Program or Award
Agreement hereunder shall confer upon any Holder any right to continue in the
employ of, or as a Director or Consultant for, the Company or any Subsidiary,
or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Company and
any Subsidiary, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any
Holder at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, and with
or without notice, or to terminate or change all other terms and conditions of
employment or engagement, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise
in a written agreement between the Holder and the Company or any Subsidiary.

4.5 _Foreign Holders_. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or
applicable Program to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in
countries other than the United States in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries operate or have Employees, Non-Employee Directors or
Consultants, or in order to comply with the requirements of any foreign
securities exchange or other Applicable Law, the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, shall have the power and authority to: (a) determine which
Subsidiaries shall be covered by the Plan; (b) determine which Eligible
Individuals outside the United States are eligible to participate in the Plan;
(c) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Eligible
Individuals outside the United States to comply with Applicable Law
(including, without limitation, applicable foreign laws or listing
requirements of any foreign securities exchange); (d) establish subplans and
modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such
actions may be necessary or advisable; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
subplans and/or modifications shall increase the share limitation contained in
Section 3.1, the Award Limit or the Director Limit; and (e) take any action,
before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval
or comply with any necessary local governmental regulatory exemptions or
approvals or listing requirements of any foreign securities exchange. 

4.6 _Non-Employee Director Awards_.

 

(a) _Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy_. The Administrator, in
its sole discretion, may provide that Awards granted to Non-Employee
Directors shall be granted pursuant to a written nondiscretionary formula
established by the Administrator (the " _Non-Employee  Director Equity
Compensation Policy_"), subject to the limitations of the Plan. The Non-
Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy shall set forth the type of
Award(s) to be granted to Non-Employee Directors, the number of Shares to be
subject to Non-Employee Director Awards, the conditions on which such Awards
shall be granted, become exercisable and/or payable and expire, and such
other terms and conditions as the Administrator shall determine in its sole
discretion. The Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy may be
modified by the Administrator from time to time in its sole discretion.

 



F-1-8

    

(b) _Director Limit_. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the
Plan or in the Non-Employee Director Equity Compensation Policy, the grant
date fair value of equity-based Awards granted to a Non-Employee Director
during any calendar year shall not exceed $500,000, increased to $1,000,000
in the fiscal year of his or her initial service as a Non-Employee Director
(the applicable amount, the " _Director Limit_ ").

 

4.7 _Minimum Vesting_. Expect with respect to a maximum of five percent (5%)
of the number of shares reserved under the Plan pursuant to Section 3.1(a)
(subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), each Award
shall be subject to a minimum vesting period of one (1) year commencing from
the grant date, or respect to Awards that vest upon the attainment of
performance goals, a performance period that is at least one (1) year. For the
purposes of clarity, this Section 4.7 shall not prevent the Committee from
accelerating any Award in accordance with any provisions set forth in this
Plan.

ARTICLE 5.

 

GRANTING OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

 

5.1 _Granting of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible
Individuals_. The Administrator is authorized to grant Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights to Eligible Individuals from time to time, in its sole
discretion, on such terms and conditions as it may determine, which shall not
be inconsistent with the Plan.

 

5.2 _Qualification of Incentive Stock Options_. The Administrator may grant
Options intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Options only to employees
of the Company, any of the Companys present or future "parent corporations"
or "subsidiary corporations" as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code,
respectively, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to
receive Incentive Stock Options under the Code. No person who qualifies as a
Greater Than 10% Stockholder may be granted an Incentive Stock Option unless
such Incentive Stock Option conforms to the applicable provisions of Section
422 of the Code. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of stock
with respect to which "incentive stock options" (within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, but without regard to Section 422(d) of the Code) are
exercisable for the first time by a Holder during any calendar year under the
Plan, and all other plans of the Company and any parent corporation or
subsidiary corporation thereof (as defined in Section 424(e) and 424(f) of the
Code, respectively), exceeds $100,000, the Options shall be treated as Non-
Qualified Stock Options to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code. The
rule set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied by
taking Options and other "incentive stock options" into account in the order
in which they were granted and the fair market value of stock shall be
determined as of the time the respective options were granted.
Any interpretations and rules under the Plan with respect to Incentive Stock
Options shall be consistent with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code.
Neither the Company nor the Administrator shall have any liability to a
Holder, or any other Person, (a) if an Option (or any part thereof) which is
intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option fails to qualify as an
Incentive Stock Option or (b) for any action or omission by the Company or the
Administrator that causes an Option not to qualify as an Incentive Stock
Option, including without limitation, the conversion of an Incentive Stock
Option to a Non-Qualified Stock Option or the grant of an Option intended as
an Incentive Stock Option that fails to satisfy the requirements under the
Code applicable to an Incentive Stock Option.

5.3 _Option and Stock Appreciation Right Exercise Price_. The exercise price
per Share subject to each Option and Stock Appreciation Right shall be set by
the Administrator, but shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share
on the date the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, is granted
(or, as to Incentive Stock Options, on the date the Option is modified,
extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code). In addition,
in the case of Incentive Stock Options granted to a Greater Than
10% Stockholder, such price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market
Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted (or the date the Option is
modified, extended or renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right that is a Substitute Award, the exercise price per share of the Shares
subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, may be less
than the Fair Market Value 

 



F-1-9

    

 per share on the date of grant; _provided_ that the exercise price of any
Substitute Award shall be determined in accordance with the applicable
requirements of Section 424 and 409A of the Code.

5.4 _Option and SAR Term_. The term of each Option (the " _Option Term_ ") and
the term of each Stock Appreciation Right (the " _SAR Term_ ") shall be set
by the Administrator in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Option Term or SAR Term, as applicable, shall not be more than (a) ten (10)
years from the date the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, is
granted to an Eligible Individual (other than, in the case of Incentive Stock
Options, a Greater Than 10% Stockholder), or (b) five (5) years from the date
an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder.
Except as limited by the requirements of Section 409A or Section 422 of the
Code and regulations and rulings thereunder or the first sentence of this
Section 5.4 and without limiting the Companys rights under Section 10.7, the
Administrator may extend the Option Term of any outstanding Option or the SAR
Term of any outstanding Stock Appreciation Right, and may extend the time
period during which vested Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may be
exercised, in connection with any Termination of Service of the Holder or
otherwise, and may amend, subject to Section 10.7 and 12.1, any other term or
condition of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right relating to such
Termination of Service of the Holder or otherwise.

5.5 _Option and SAR Vesting_. The period during which the right to exercise,
in whole or in part, an Option or Stock Appreciation Right vests in the
Holder, including, without limitation, any performance-based vesting criteria
applicable to such period, shall be set by the Administrator and set forth in
the applicable Award Agreement. Unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator in the Award Agreement, the applicable Program or by action of
the Administrator following the grant of the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, (a) no portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right which
is unexercisable at a Holders Termination of Service shall thereafter become
exercisable and (b) the portion of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that
is unexercisable at a Holders Termination of Service shall automatically
expire thirty (30) days following such Termination of Service.

ARTICLE 6.

 

EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

 

6.1 _Exercise and Payment_. An exercisable Option or Stock Appreciation Right
may be exercised in whole or in part. However, an Option or
Stock Appreciation Right shall not be exercisable with respect to fractional
Shares and the Administrator may require that, by the terms of the Option or
Stock Appreciation Right, a partial exercise must be with respect to a minimum
number of Shares. Payment of the amounts payable with respect to Stock
Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Article 6 shall be in cash, Shares (based
on its Fair Market Value as of the date the Stock Appreciation Right is
exercised), or a combination of both, as determined by the Administrator.

6.2 _Manner of Exercise_. Except as set forth in Section 6.3, all or a portion
of an exercisable Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be deemed
exercised upon delivery of all of the following to the Secretary of the
Company, the stock plan administrator of the Company or such other person or
entity designated by the Administrator, or his, her or its office, as
applicable:

(a) A written or electronic notice complying with the applicable rules
established by the Administrator stating that the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, or a portion thereof, is exercised. The notice shall be
signed or otherwise acknowledged electronically by the Holder or other person
then entitled to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right or such
portion thereof; 

(b) Such representations and documents as the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, deems necessary or advisable to effect compliance with
Applicable Law.

 



F-1-10

    

(c) In the event that the Option shall be exercised pursuant to Section 10.3
by any person or persons other than the Holder, appropriate proof of the
right of such person or persons to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right, as determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator; and

 

(d) Full payment of the exercise price and applicable withholding taxes for
the Shares with respect to which the Option or Stock Appreciation Right,
or portion thereof, is exercised, in a manner permitted by the Administrator
in accordance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2.

6.3 _Expiration of Option Term or SAR Term: Automatic Exercise of In-The-
Money Options and Stock Appreciation Rights_. The Administrator may include a
provision in an Award Agreement providing for the automatic exercise of an
Option or a Stock Appreciation Right on the last business day of the
applicable Option Term or Stock Appreciation Right Term that was initially
established by the Administrator for such Option or Stock Appreciation
Right ( _e.g._ , the last business day prior to the tenth anniversary of the
date of grant of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right if the Option or
Stock Appreciation Right initially had a ten-year Option Term or Stock
Appreciation Right Term, as applicable).

6.4 _Notification Regarding Disposition_. The Holder shall give the Company
prompt written or electronic notice of any disposition of Shares acquired by
exercise of an Incentive Stock Option which occurs within (a) two years from
the date of granting (including the date the Option is modified, extended or
renewed for purposes of Section 424(h) of the Code) such Option to such
Holder, or (b) one year after the date of transfer of such Shares to such
Holder. Such notice shall specify the date of such disposition or other
transfer and the amount realized, in cash, other property, assumption of
indebtedness or other consideration, by the Holder in such disposition or
other transfer.

ARTICLE 7. 

AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK

7.1  _Award of Restricted Stock_. The Administrator is authorized to grant
Restricted Stock to Eligible Individuals, and shall determine the terms and
conditions, including the restrictions applicable to each award of Restricted
Stock, which terms and conditions shall not be inconsistent with the Plan or
any applicable Program, and may impose such conditions on the issuance of such
Restricted Stock as it deems appropriate. The Administrator shall establish
the purchase price, if any, and form of payment for Restricted Stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if a purchase price is charged, such purchase
price shall be no less than the par value, if any, of the Shares to be
purchased, unless otherwise permitted by Applicable Law. In all cases, legal
consideration shall be required for each issuance of Restricted Stock to the
extent required by Applicable Law.

7.2 _Rights as Stockholders_. Subject to Section 7.4, upon issuance of
Restricted Stock, the Holder shall have, unless otherwise provided by the
Administrator, all the rights of a stockholder with respect to said Shares,
subject to the restrictions in the Plan, any applicable Program and/or the
applicable Award Agreement, including the right to receive all dividends and
other distributions paid or made with respect to the Shares to the extent such
dividends and other distributions have a record date that is on or after the
date on which the Holder to whom such Shares are granted becomes the record
holder of such Restricted Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the sole
discretion of the Administrator, any extraordinary distributions with respect
to the Shares may be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 7.3. In
addition, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, with respect to a
share of Restricted Stock, dividends which are paid prior to vesting
shall only be paid out to the Holder to the extent that all vesting
conditions are subsequently satisfied and the share of Restricted Stock vests.

7.3  _Restrictions_. All Shares of Restricted Stock (including any Shares
received by Holders thereof with respect to shares of Restricted Stock as a
result of stock dividends, stock splits or any other form of recapitalization)
shall be subject to such restrictions and vesting requirements as the
Administrator shall provide in the applicable Program or Award Agreement,
including, without limitation, performance-based restrictions or vesting. By 

 



F-1-11

    

 action taken after the Restricted Stock is issued, the Administrator may, on
such terms and conditions as it may determine to be appropriate, accelerate
the vesting of such Restricted Stock by removing any or all of the
restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable Program or Award
Agreement.

7.4 _Repurchase or Forfeiture of Restricted Stock_. Except as otherwise
determined by the Administrator, if no price was paid by the Holder for the
Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service during the applicable
restriction period, the Holders rights in unvested Restricted Stock then
subject to restrictions shall lapse, and such Restricted Stock shall be
surrendered to the Company and cancelled without consideration on the date of
such Termination of Service. If a price was paid by the Holder for the
Restricted Stock, upon a Termination of Service during the applicable
restriction period, the Company shall have the right to repurchase from the
Holder the unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions at a cash
price per share equal to the price paid by the Holder for such Restricted
Stock or such other amount as may be specified in the applicable Program or
Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, may provide that upon certain events, including, without
limitation, the Holders death, retirement or disability or any other
specified Termination of Service or any other event, the Holders rights in
unvested Restricted Stock then subject to restrictions shall not lapse,
such Restricted Stock shall vest and cease to be forfeitable and, if
applicable, the Company shall cease to have a right of repurchase.

7.5 _Section 83(b) Election_. If a Holder makes an election under Section
83(b) of the Code to be taxed with respect to the Restricted Stock as of the
date of transfer of the Restricted Stock rather than as of the date or dates
upon which the Holder would otherwise be taxable under Section 83(a) of the
Code, the Holder shall be required to deliver a copy of such election to the
Company promptly after filing such election with the Internal Revenue Service
along with proof of the timely filing thereof with the Internal Revenue
Service.

ARTICLE 8.

 

AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

8.1  _Grant of Restricted Stock Units_. The Administrator is authorized to
grant Awards of Restricted Stock Units to any Eligible Individual selected by
the Administrator in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as
determined by the Administrator.

8.2 _Term_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the term of a Restricted
Stock Unit award shall be set by the Administrator in its sole discretion.

8.3 _Purchase Price_. The Administrator shall specify the purchase price, if
any, to be paid by the Holder to the Company with respect to any Restricted
Stock Unit Award; _provided_ , _however_ , that the value of the consideration
shall not be less than the par value of a Share, unless otherwise permitted by
Applicable Law.

 

8.4 _Vesting of Restricted Stock Units_. At the time of grant, the
Administrator shall specify the date or dates on which the Restricted Stock
Units shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable, and may specify such
conditions to vesting as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation,
vesting based upon the Holders duration of service to the Company or any
Subsidiary, Company performance, individual performance or other specific
criteria, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or
periods, as determined by the Administrator.

 

8.5 _Maturity and Payment_. At the time of grant, the Administrator shall
specify the maturity date applicable to each grant of Restricted Stock
Units, which shall be no earlier than the vesting date or dates of the Award
and may be determined at the election of the Holder (if permitted by the
applicable Award Agreement); _provided_ that, except as otherwise determined
by the Administrator, and subject to compliance with Section 409A, in no

 



F-1-12

    

 event shall the maturity date relating to each Restricted Stock Unit occur
following the later of (a) the 15th day of the third month following the end
of the calendar year in which the applicable portion of the Restricted Stock
Unit vests; or (b) the 15th day of the third month following the end of the
Companys fiscal year in which the applicable portion of the Restricted Stock
Unit vests. On the maturity date, the Company shall, in accordance with the
applicable Award Agreement and subject to Section 10.4(f), transfer to the
Holder one unrestricted, fully transferable Share for each Restricted Stock
Unit scheduled to be paid out on such date and not previously forfeited, or in
the sole discretion of the Administrator, an amount in cash equal to the Fair
Market Value of such Shares on the maturity date or a combination of cash and
Common Stock as determined by the Administrator.

8.6 _Payment upon Termination of Service_. An Award of Restricted Stock Units
shall only be payable while the Holder is an Employee, a Consultant or a
member of the Board, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may provide (in an Award Agreement or
otherwise) that a Restricted Stock Unit award may be paid subsequent to a
Termination of Service in certain events, the Holders death, retirement or
disability or any other specified Termination of Service.

 

ARTICLE 9.

AWARD OF OTHER STOCK OR CASH BASED AWARDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

9.1 _Other Stock or Cash Based Awards_. The Administrator is authorized to
grant Other Stock or Cash Based Awards, including awards entitling a Holder
to receive Shares or cash to be delivered immediately or in the future, to any
Eligible Individual. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any applicable
Program, the Administrator shall determine the terms and conditions of each
Other Stock or Cash Based Award, including the term of the Award, any exercise
or purchase price, performance goals, transfer restrictions, vesting
conditions and other terms and conditions applicable thereto, which shall be
set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Other Stock or Cash Based Awards
may be paid in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares, as
determined by the Administrator, and may be available as a form of payment
in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan, as stand-alone
payments, as a part of a bonus, deferred bonus, deferred compensation or other
arrangement, and/or as payment in lieu of compensation to which an Eligible
Individual is otherwise entitled.

9.2 _Dividend Equivalents_. Dividend Equivalents may be granted by the
Administrator, either alone or in tandem with another Award, based on
dividends declared on the Common Stock, to be credited as of dividend payment
dates during the period between the date the Dividend Equivalents are granted
to a Holder and the date such Dividend Equivalents terminate or expire, as
determined by the Administrator. Such Dividend Equivalents shall be converted
to cash or additional Shares by such formula and at such time and subject to
such restrictions and limitations as may be determined by the Administrator.
In addition, Dividend Equivalents with respect to an Award shall only be paid
out to the Holder to the extent that the full vesting conditions are
subsequently satisfied and the Award vests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Dividend Equivalents shall be payable with respect to Options or Stock
Appreciation Rights.

ARTICLE 10.

 

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AWARDS

10.1  _Payment_. The Administrator shall determine the method or methods by
which payments by any Holder with respect to any Awards granted under the Plan
shall be made, including, without limitation: (a) cash or check, (b)
Shares (including, in the case of payment of the exercise price of an Award,
Shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Award) or Shares held for such
minimum period of time as may be established by the Administrator, in each
case, having a Fair Market Value on the date of delivery equal to the
aggregate payments

 



F-1-13

    

 required, (c) delivery of a written or electronic notice that the Holder has
placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with
respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise or vesting of an Award, and
that the broker has been directed to pay a sufficient portion of the net
proceeds of the sale to the Company in satisfaction of the aggregate payments
required; _provided_ that payment of such proceeds is then made to the
Company upon settlement of such sale, (d) other form of legal consideration
acceptable to the Administrator in its sole discretion, or (e) any combination
of the above permitted forms of payment. Notwithstanding any other provision
of the Plan to the contrary, no Holder who is a Director or an "executive
officer" of the Company within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange
Act shall be permitted to make payment with respect to any Awards
granted under the Plan, or continue any extension of credit with respect to
such payment, with a loan from the Company or a loan arranged by the Company
in violation of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act.

 

10.2 _Tax Withholding_. The Company or any Subsidiary shall have the authority
and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Holder to remit to
the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, local and
foreign taxes (including the Holders FICA, employment tax or other social
security contribution obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect
to any taxable event concerning a Holder arising as a result of the Plan or
any Award. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion and in satisfaction
of the foregoing requirement, or in satisfaction of such additional
withholding obligations as a Holder may have elected, allow a Holder to
satisfy such obligations by any payment means described in Section 10.1
hereof, including without limitation, by allowing such Holder to elect to have
the Company or any Subsidiary withhold Shares otherwise issuable under an
Award (or allow the surrender of Shares). The number of Shares that may be so
withheld or surrendered shall be no greater than the number of Shares that
have a fair market value on the date of withholding or repurchase equal to
the aggregate amount of such liabilities based on the maximum statutory
withholding rates in such Holders applicable jurisdiction for federal, state,
local and foreign income tax and payroll tax purposes that are applicable to
such taxable income. The Administrator shall determine the fair market value
of the Shares, consistent with applicable provisions of the Code, for tax
withholding obligations due in connection with a broker-assisted cashless
Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise involving the sale of Shares to
pay the Option or Stock Appreciation Right exercise price or any tax
withholding obligation.

10.3 _Transferability of Awards_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 10.3(b) and 10.3(c):

 

(i) No Award under the Plan may be sold, pledged, assigned or transferred in
any manner other than (A) by will or the laws of descent and distribution
or (B) subject to the consent of the Administrator, pursuant to a DRO, unless
and until such Award has been exercised or the Shares underlying such Award
have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such Shares have lapsed;

 

(ii) No Award or interest or right therein shall be liable for or otherwise
subject to the debts, contracts or engagements of the Holder or the
Holders successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by
transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, hypothecation, encumbrance,
assignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or
involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment
or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy) unless and
until such Award has been exercised, or the Shares underlying such Award have
been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such Shares have lapsed, and
any attempted disposition of an Award prior to satisfaction of these
conditions shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that
such disposition is permitted by Section 10.3(a)(i); and

 

(iii) During the lifetime of the Holder, only the Holder may exercise any
exercisable portion of an Award granted to such Holder under the Plan, unless
it has been disposed of pursuant to a DRO. After the death of the Holder, any
exercisable portion of an Award may, prior to the time when such portion
becomes unexercisable under the Plan or the applicable Program or Award
Agreement, be exercised by the Holders personal representative or by any
person empowered to do so under the deceased Holders will or under the then-
applicable laws of descent and distribution.

 



F-1-14

    

(b) Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, may determine to permit a Holder or a Permitted Transferee of
such Holder to transfer an Award other than an Incentive Stock Option (unless
such Incentive Stock Option is intended to become a Nonqualified Stock Option)
to any one or more Permitted Transferees of such Holder, subject to the
following terms and conditions: (i) an Award transferred to a Permitted
Transferee shall not be assignable or transferable by the Permitted Transferee
other than (A) to another Permitted Transferee of the applicable Holder or
(B) by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent
of the Administrator, pursuant to a DRO; (ii) an Award transferred to a
Permitted Transferee shall continue to be subject to all the terms
and conditions of the Award as applicable to the original Holder (other than
the ability to further transfer the Award to any Person other than another
Permitted Transferee of the applicable Holder); and (iii) the Holder (or
transferring Permitted Transferee) and the receiving Permitted Transferee
shall execute any and all documents requested by the Administrator, including,
without limitation documents to (A) confirm the status of the transferee as a
Permitted Transferee, (B) satisfy any requirements for an exemption for the
transfer under Applicable Law and (C) evidence the transfer. In addition, and
further notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), hereof, the Administrator, in its
sole discretion, may determine to permit a Holder to transfer Incentive Stock
Options to a trust that constitutes a Permitted Transferee if, under Section
671 of the Code and other Applicable Law, the Holder is considered the sole
beneficial owner of the Incentive Stock Option while it is held in the trust.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 10.3(a), a Holder may, in the manner determined by
the Administrator, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the
Holder and to receive any distribution with respect to any Award upon the
Holders death. A beneficiary, legal guardian, legal representative, or other
person claiming any rights pursuant to the Plan is subject to all terms and
conditions of the Plan and any Program or Award Agreement applicable to the
Holder and any additional restrictions deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Administrator. If the Holder is married or a domestic partner in a domestic
partnership qualified under Applicable Law and resides in a community property
state, a designation of a person other than the Holders spouse or domestic
partner, as applicable, as the Holders beneficiary with respect to more than
50% of the Holders interest in the Award shall not be effective without the
prior written or electronic consent of the Holders spouse or domestic
partner. If no beneficiary has been designated or survives the
Holder, payment shall be made to the person entitled thereto pursuant to the
Holders will or the laws of descent and distribution. Subject to the
foregoing, a beneficiary designation may be changed or revoked by a Holder at
any time; _provided_  that the change or revocation is delivered in writing
to the Administrator prior to the Holders death.

10.4 _Conditions to Issuance of Shares_.

(a) The Administrator shall determine the methods by which Shares shall be
delivered or deemed to be delivered to Holders. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver
any certificates or make any book entries evidencing Shares pursuant to the
exercise of any Award, unless and until the Administrator has determined, with
advice of counsel, that the issuance of such Shares is in compliance with
Applicable Law and the Shares are covered by an effective registration
statement or applicable exemption from registration. In addition to the terms
and conditions provided herein, the Administrator may require that a Holder
make such reasonable covenants, agreements and representations as the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, deems advisable in order to comply with
Applicable Law.

 

(b) All share certificates delivered pursuant to the Plan and all Shares
issued pursuant to book entry procedures are subject to any stop-transfer
orders and other restrictions as the Administrator deems necessary or
advisable to comply with Applicable Law. The Administrator may place legends
on any share certificate or book entry to reference restrictions applicable to
the Shares (including, without limitation, restrictions applicable to
Restricted Stock).

(c) The Administrator shall have the right to require any Holder to comply
with any timing or other restrictions with respect to the settlement,
distribution or exercise of any Award, including a window-period limitation,
as may be imposed in the sole discretion of the Administrator.

 



F-1-15

    

(d) No fractional Shares shall be issued and the Administrator, in its sole
discretion, shall determine whether cash shall be given in lieu of fractional
Shares or whether such fractional Shares shall be eliminated by rounding down.

(e) The Company, in its sole discretion, may (i) retain physical possession
of any stock certificate evidencing Shares until any restrictions thereon
shall have lapsed and/or (ii) require that the stock certificates evidencing
such Shares be held in custody by a designated escrow agent (which may but
need not be the Company) until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed, and
that the Holder deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to such
Shares.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise
determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not deliver to any Holder certificates evidencing Shares issued in
connection with any Award and instead such Shares shall be recorded in the
books of the Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan
administrator).

 

10.5 _Forfeiture and Claw-Back Provisions_. All Awards (including any
proceeds, gains or other economic benefit actually or constructively received
by a Holder upon any receipt or exercise of any Award or upon the receipt or
resale of any Shares underlying the Award and any payments of a portion of an
incentive-based bonus pool allocated to a Holder) shall, unless otherwise
determined by the Administrator or required by Applicable Law, be subject to
the provisions of any claw-back policy implemented by the Company, including,
without limitation, any claw-back policy adopted to comply with the
requirements of Applicable Law, including, without limitation, the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder, whether or not such claw-back policy was in place at
the time of grant of an Award, to the extent set forth in such claw-back
policy and/or in the applicable Award Agreement.

10.6 _Prohibition on Repricing_. Subject to Section 12.2, the
Administrator shall not, without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company, (a) authorize the amendment of any outstanding Option or Stock
Appreciation Right to reduce its price per Share, or (b) cancel any Option or
Stock Appreciation Right in exchange for cash or another Award when the
Option or Stock Appreciation Right price per Share exceeds the Fair Market
Value of the underlying Shares. Furthermore, for purposes of this Section
10.6, except in connection with a corporate transaction involving the Company
(including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary
cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-
up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the terms of outstanding
Awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price per Share of
outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights or cancel
outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for cash, other
Awards or Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price per
Share that is less than the exercise price per Share of the original Options
or Stock Appreciation Rights without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company.

10.7 _Amendment of Awards_. Subject to Applicable Law and Section 10.6,
the Administrator may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award,
including but not limited to, substituting therefor another Award of the same
or a different type, changing the date of exercise or settlement, and
converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Non-Qualified Stock Option. The
Holders consent to such action shall be required unless (a) the Administrator
determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not
materially and adversely affect the Holder, or (b) the change is otherwise
permitted under the Plan (including, without limitation, under Section 12.2 or
12.10).

 

10.8 _Data Privacy_. As a condition of receipt of any Award, each Holder
explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer,
in electronic or other form, of personal data as described in this Section
10.8 by and among, as applicable, the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Holders
participation in the Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries may hold certain
personal information about a Holder, including but not limited to, the
Holders name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social
security or insurance number or other identification number, salary,

 



F-1-16

    

 nationality, job title(s), any shares of stock held in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and details of all Awards, in each case, for the purpose of
implementing, managing and administering the Plan and Awards (the " _Data_
"). The Company and its Subsidiaries may transfer the Data amongst themselves
as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration and management
of a Holders participation in the Plan, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
may each further transfer the Data to any third parties assisting the Company
and its Subsidiaries in the implementation, administration and management of
the Plan. These recipients may be located in the Holders country, or
elsewhere, and the Holders country may have different data privacy laws and
protections than the recipients country. Through acceptance of an Award, each
Holder authorizes such recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and
transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing the Holders participation in the
Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required to a
broker or other third party with whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or the Holder may elect to deposit any Shares. The Data related to a Holder
will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer, and manage
the Holders participation in the Plan. A Holder may, at any time, view the
Data held by the Company with respect to such Holder, request additional
information about the storage and processing of the Data with respect to such
Holder, recommend any necessary corrections to the Data with respect to the
Holder or refuse or withdraw the consents herein in writing, in any case
without cost, by contacting his or her local human resources representative.
The Company may cancel the Holders ability to participate in the Plan and,
in the Administrators discretion, the Holder may forfeit any outstanding
Awards if the Holder refuses or withdraws his or her consents as described
herein. For more information on the consequences of refusal to consent or
withdrawal of consent, Holders may contact their local human resources
representative.

ADMINISTRATION

11.1  _Administrator_. The Committee shall administer the Plan (except as
otherwise permitted herein). To the extent necessary to comply with Rule 16b-3
of the Exchange Act, the Committee shall take all action with respect to such
Awards, and the individuals taking such action shall consist solely of two or
more Non-Employee Directors, each of whom is intended to qualify as a "non-
employee director" as defined by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or any
successor rule. Additionally, to the extent required by Applicable Law, each
of the individuals constituting the Committee shall be an "independent
director" under the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation
system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any action taken by the Committee shall be valid and effective,
whether or not members of the Committee at the time of such action are later
determined not to have satisfied the requirements for membership set forth in
this Section 11.1 or the Organizational Documents. Except as may otherwise be
provided in the Organizational Documents or as otherwise required by
Applicable Law, (a) appointment of Committee members shall be effective upon
acceptance of appointment, (b) Committee members may resign at any time by
delivering written or electronic notice to the Board and (c) vacancies in the
Committee may only be filled by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
the full Board, acting by a majority of its members in office, shall conduct
the general administration of the Plan with respect to Awards granted to Non-

Plan, all Programs and Award Agreements, and to adopt such rules for the
administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and any Program as
are not inconsistent with the Plan, to interpret, amend or revoke any such
rules and to amend the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement; _provided_ that
the rights or obligations of the Holder of the Award that is the subject of
any such Program or Award Agreement are not materially and adversely affected
by such amendment, unless the consent of the Holder is obtained or such
amendment is

 



F-1-17

    

 otherwise permitted under Section 10.7 or Section 12.10. In its sole
discretion, the Board may at any time and from time to time exercise any and
all rights and duties of the Committee in its capacity as the Administrator
under the Plan except with respect to matters which under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act or any successor rule, or any regulations or rules issued
thereunder, or the rules of any securities exchange or automated quotation
system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded are required to be
determined in the sole discretion of the Committee.

 

11.3 _Action by the Administrator_. Unless otherwise established by the Board,
set forth in any Organizational Documents or as required by Applicable Law, a
majority of the Administrator shall constitute a quorum and the acts of a
majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present,
and acts approved in writing by all members of the Administrator in lieu of a
meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Administrator. Each member of the
Administrator is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or
other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary, the Companys independent certified public
accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional
retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan.

Individual (including, without limitation, any Awards granted in tandem with
another Award granted pursuant to the Plan);

(c) Determine the number of Awards to be granted and the number of Shares to
which an Award will relate;

 

(d) Determine the terms and conditions of any Award granted pursuant to the
Plan, including, but not limited to, the exercise price, grant price,
purchase price or performance criteria, any restrictions or limitations on
the Award, any schedule for vesting, lapse of forfeiture restrictions or
restrictions on the exercisability of an Award, and accelerations or waivers
thereof, and any provisions related to non-competition and claw-back and
recapture of gain on an Award, based in each case on such considerations as
the Administrator in its sole discretion determines;

 

(e) Determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances an Award
may be settled in, or the exercise price of an Award may be paid in cash,
Shares, other Awards, or other property, or an Award may be canceled,
forfeited, or surrendered;

(f) Prescribe the form of each Award Agreement, which need not be identical
for each Holder;

to the Plan or as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to
administer the Plan.

 



F-1-18

    

11.5 _Decisions Binding_. The Administrators interpretation of the Plan, any
Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, any Program or any Award Agreement and
all decisions and determinations by the Administrator with respect to the Plan
are final, binding and conclusive on all Persons.

 

11.6 _Delegation of Authority_. The Board or Committee may from time to time
delegate to a committee of one or more members of the Board or one or
more officers of the Company the authority to grant or amend Awards or to
take other administrative actions pursuant to this Article 11; _provided_ ,
___however_ , that in no event shall an officer of the Company be delegated
the authority to grant Awards to, or amend Awards held by, the following
individuals: (a) individuals who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, or (b) officers of the Company (or Directors) to whom authority to grant
or amend Awards has been delegated hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that
any delegation of administrative authority shall only be permitted to the
extent it is permissible under any Organizational Documents and Applicable
Law. Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits
that the Board or Committee specifies at the time of such delegation or that
are otherwise included in the applicable Organizational Documents, and the
Board or Committee, as applicable, may at any time rescind the authority so
delegated or appoint a new delegatee. At all times, the delegatee appointed
under this Section 11.6 shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the
Board or the Committee, as applicable, and the Board or the Committee may
abolish any committee at any time and re-vest in itself any previously
delegated authority.

 

ARTICLE 12.

 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

12.1  _Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 12.1(b), the Plan may be wholly or
partially amended or otherwise modified, suspended or terminated at any time
or from time to time by the Board; _provided_ that, except as provided in
Section 10.5 and Section 12.10, no amendment, suspension or termination of the
Plan shall, without the consent of the Holder, materially and adversely
affect any rights or obligations under any Award theretofore granted or
awarded, unless the Award itself otherwise expressly so provides.

 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 12.1(a), the Board may not, except as provided in
Section 12.2, take any of the following actions without approval of the
Companys stockholders given within twelve (12) months before or after such
action: (i) increase the limit imposed in Section 3.1 on the maximum number of
Shares which may be issued under the Plan or the Award Limit, (ii) reduce the
price per share of any outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted
under the Plan or take any action prohibited under Section 10.6, or (iii)
cancel any Option or Stock Appreciation Right in exchange for cash or another
Award in violation of Section 10.6.

(c) No Awards may be granted or awarded during any period of suspension or
after termination of the Plan, and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event may any Award be granted under the Plan after the tenth
(10th) anniversary of the earlier of (i) the date on which the Plan was
adopted by the Board or (ii) the date the Plan was approved by the Companys
stockholders (such anniversary, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Any Awards that
are outstanding on the Expiration Date shall remain in force according to the
terms of the Plan, the applicable Program and the applicable Award Agreement.

12.2 _Changes in Common Stock or Assets of the Company, Acquisition or
Liquidation of the Company and Other Corporate Events_.

(a) In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange
of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal
cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change
affecting the shares of the Companys stock or the share price of the
Companys stock other than an Equity Restructuring, the Administrator may
make equitable adjustments, if any, to reflect such change with respect to:

 



F-1-19

    

 (i) the aggregate number and kind of Shares that may be issued under the
Plan (including, but not limited to, adjustments of the limitations in Section
3.1 on the maximum number and kind of Shares which may be issued under the
Plan, and adjustments of the Award Limit); (ii) the number and kind of Shares
(or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) the
terms and conditions of any outstanding Awards (including, without
limitation, any applicable performance targets or criteria with respect
thereto); (iv) the grant or exercise price per share for any outstanding
Awards under the Plan; and (v) the number and kind of Shares (or
other securities or property) for which automatic grants are subsequently to
be made to new and continuing Non-Employee Directors pursuant to Section 4.6.

 

(b) In the event of any transaction or event described in Section 12.2(a) or
any unusual or nonrecurring transactions or events affecting the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, or the financial statements of the Company or any
Subsidiary, or of changes in Applicable Law or Applicable Accounting
Standards, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and on such terms and
conditions as it deems appropriate, either by the terms of the Award or by
action taken prior to the occurrence of such transaction or event, is hereby
authorized to take any one or more of the following actions whenever the
Administrator determines that such action is appropriate in order to prevent
dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be
made available under the Plan or with respect to any Award under the Plan, to
facilitate such transactions or events or to give effect to such changes in
Applicable Law or Applicable Accounting Standards:

(i) To provide for the termination of any such Award in exchange for an amount
of cash and/or other property with a value equal to the amount that would
have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the
Holders rights (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the
occurrence of the transaction or event described in this Section 12.2 the
Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained
upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Holders rights, then
such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment);

(ii) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor
corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for
by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or
survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate
adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and applicable exercise
or purchase price, in all cases, as determined by the Administrator;

(iii) To make adjustments in the number and type of Shares of the Companys
stock (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and/or
in the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and
the criteria included in, outstanding Awards and Awards which may be granted
in the future;

 

(iv) To provide that such Award shall be exercisable or payable or fully
vested with respect to all Shares covered thereby, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the Plan or the applicable Program or Award Agreement;

(v) To replace such Award with other rights or property selected by the
Administrator; and/or

(vi) To provide that the Award cannot vest, be exercised or become payable
after such event.

 

(c) In connection with the occurrence of any Equity Restructuring, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 12.2(a) and 12.2(b):

 

(i) The number and type of securities subject to each outstanding Award and
the exercise price or grant price thereof, if applicable, shall be
equitably adjusted (and the adjustments provided under this Section
12.2(c)(i) shall be nondiscretionary and shall be final and binding on the
affected Holder and the Company); and/or

 

(ii) The Administrator shall make such equitable adjustments, if any, as the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, may deem appropriate to reflect
such Equity Restructuring with respect to the aggregate number and kind of
Shares that may be issued under the Plan (including, but not limited to,
adjustments of the limitation in Section 3.1 on the maximum number and kind of
Shares which may be issued under the Plan, and adjustments of the Award
Limit).

 



F-1-20

    

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in the event of a Change
in Control, the parties thereto may cause such Awards to be continued in
effect or be assumed or an equivalent Award substituted by the successor
corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the
event an Award continues in effect or is assumed or an equivalent Award
substituted, and the surviving or successor company terminates Holders
employment or service without "cause" (as such term is defined in the sole
discretion of the Administrator, or as set forth in the Award Agreement
relating to such Award) upon or within twelve (12) months following the Change
in Control, then such Holder shall be fully vested in such continued, assumed
or substituted Award.

 

(e) In the event that the successor corporation in a Change in Control refuses
to assume, continue or substitute for an Award, any or all of such Award
shall become fully exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction and all forfeiture restrictions on any or all of such Award to
lapse; _provided_ that the portion of such Award subject to performance-based
vesting shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award
Agreement and, in the absence of applicable terms and conditions, the
Administrators discretion. If any such Award is exercisable in lieu of
assumption or substitution in the event of a Change in Control, the
Administrator shall notify the Holder that such Award shall be fully
exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice,
contingent upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, and such Award shall
terminate upon the expiration of such period.

(f) For the purposes of this Section 12.2, an Award shall be considered
assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to
purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to
the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other
securities or property) received in the Change in Control by holders of Common
Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if
holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration
chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such consideration received in the Change in Control was
not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its parent, the
Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for
the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Award, for each
Share subject to an Award, to be solely common stock of the successor
corporation or its parent equal in fair market value to the per-share
consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the Change in Control.

(g) The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may include such further
provisions and limitations in any Award, agreement or certificate, as it may
deem equitable and in the best interests of the Company that are not
inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.

 

(h) Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, no adjustment or action
described in this Section 12.2 or in any other provision of the Plan shall be
authorized to the extent it would (i) cause the Plan to violate Section
422(b)(1) of the Code, (ii) result in short-swing profits liability under
Section 16 of the Exchange Act or violate the exemptive conditions of Rule
16b-3 of the Exchange Act, or (iii) cause an Award to fail to be exempt from
or comply with Section 409A.

(i) The existence of the Plan, any Program, any Award Agreement and/or the
Awards granted hereunder shall not affect or restrict in any way the right or
power of the Company or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize
any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the
Companys capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of
the Company, any issue of stock or of options, warrants or rights to purchase
stock or of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stocks whose
rights are superior to or affect the Common Stock or the rights thereof or
which are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or the
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or
any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding,
whether of a similar character or otherwise.

(j) In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split, combination or
exchange of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than
normal cash dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other change
affecting the Shares or the share price of the Common Stock including any
Equity Restructuring, for reasons of administrative convenience, the Company,
in its sole discretion, may refuse to permit the exercise of any Award during
a period of up to thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of any such
transaction.

 



F-1-21

    

12.3 _Approval of Plan by Stockholders_. The Plan shall be submitted for the
approval of the Companys stockholders within twelve (12) months after the
date of the Boards initial adoption of the Plan. Awards may be granted or
awarded prior to such stockholder approval; _provided_ that such Awards shall
not be exercisable, shall not vest and the restrictions thereon shall not
lapse and no Shares shall be issued pursuant thereto prior to the time when
the Plan is approved by the Companys stockholders; and _provided_ , _further_
, that if such approval has not been obtained at the end of said twelve (12)
month period, all Awards previously granted or awarded under the Plan shall
thereupon be canceled and become null and void.

 

12.4 _No Stockholders Rights_. Except as otherwise provided herein or in an
applicable Program or Award Agreement, a Holder shall have none of the
rights of a stockholder with respect to Shares covered by any Award until the
Holder becomes the record owner of such Shares.

12.5 _Paperless Administration_. In the event that the Company establishes,
for itself or using the services of a third party, an automated system for the
documentation, granting or exercise of Awards, such as a system using an
internet website or interactive voice response, then the paperless
documentation, granting or exercise of Awards by a Holder may be permitted
through the use of such an automated system.

 

12.6 _Effect of Plan upon Other Compensation Plans_. The adoption of the Plan
shall not affect any other compensation or incentive plans in effect for the
Company or any Subsidiary. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to limit the
right of the Company or any Subsidiary: (a) to establish any other forms of
incentives or compensation for Employees, Directors or Consultants of the
Company or any Subsidiary, or (b) to grant or assume options or other rights
or awards otherwise than under the Plan in connection with any proper
corporate purpose including without limitation, the grant or assumption of
options in connection with the acquisition by purchase, lease, merger,
consolidation or otherwise, of the business, stock or assets of any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, firm or association.

 

12.7 _Compliance with Laws_. The Plan, the granting and vesting of Awards
under the Plan and the issuance and delivery of Shares and the payment of
money under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject
to compliance with all Applicable Law (including but not limited to state,
federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements), and to such
approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection
therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such
restrictions, and the person acquiring such securities shall, if requested by
the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the
Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all
Applicable Law. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may take whatever
actions it deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with Applicable
Law, including, without limitation, placing legends on share certificates and
issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrator may not
take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate
Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards
granted or awarded hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary
to conform to Applicable Law.

12.8 _Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or
Exchange Act_. The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for
convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of
the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control. References to
sections of Applicable Law, including the Code, the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act shall include any amendment or successor thereto.

12.9 _Governing Law_. The Plan and any Programs and Award Agreements
hereunder shall be administered, interpreted and enforced under the internal
laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws thereof or
of any other jurisdiction.

 

12.10 _Section 409A_. To the extent that the Administrator determines that any
Award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A, the Plan, the
Program pursuant to which such Award is granted and the Award

 



F-1-22

    

 Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions
required by Section 409A. In that regard, to the extent any Award under the
Plan or any other compensatory plan or arrangement of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to Section 409A, and such Award or other amount is
payable on account of a Participants Termination of Service (or any similarly
defined term), then (a) such Award or amount shall only be paid to the extent
such Termination of Service qualifies as a "separation from service" as
defined in Section 409A, and (b) if such Award or amount is payable to a
"specified employee" as defined in Section 409A then to the extent required
in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A, such Award or
other compensatory payment shall not be payable prior to the earlier of (i)
the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of the
Participants Termination of Service, or (ii) the date of the Participants
death. To the extent applicable, the Plan, the Program and any
Award Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A.
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that
following the Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may
be subject to Section 409A, the Administrator may (but is not obligated to),
without a Holders consent, adopt such amendments to the Plan and the
applicable Program and Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures
(including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or
take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or
appropriate to (A) exempt the Award from Section 409A and/or preserve the
intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or
(B) comply with the requirements of Section 409A and thereby avoid the
application of any penalty taxes under Section 409A. The Company makes no
representations or warranties as to the tax treatment of any Award under
Section 409A or otherwise. The Company shall have no obligation under this
Section 12.10 or otherwise to take any action (whether or not described
herein) to avoid the imposition of taxes, penalties or interest under Section
409A with respect to any Award and shall have no liability to any Holder or
any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan
are determined to constitute non-compliant, "nonqualified deferred
compensation" subject to the imposition of taxes, penalties and/or interest
under Section 409A.

 

12.11 _Unfunded Status of Awards_. The Plan is intended to be an "unfunded"
plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to
a Holder pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or
Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are greater than those
of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

12.12 _Indemnification_. To the extent permitted under Applicable Law and the
Organizational Documents, each member of the Administrator shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost,
liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such
member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or
proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be
involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and
against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of
