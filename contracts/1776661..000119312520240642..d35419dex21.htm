sentence. In the event that the Financing Conditions are not satisfied or waived on or prior to the date that is ten (10)&nbsp;business days after the Termination Date (as defined in the Acquisition Agreement in effect as of the date hereof) or, if
earlier, (a)&nbsp;the date on which you notify us in writing that the Acquisition Agreement has terminated in accordance with its terms and/or (b)&nbsp;the date of the consummation of the Acquisition (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, prior to
the consummation thereof) with or without the funding or effectiveness of the Facilities, then this Commitment Letter and the commitments and undertakings of each Commitment Party hereunder will automatically terminate, unless such Commitment Party,

Company&#146;s stockholders within twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the date of the Board&#146;s initial adoption of the Plan. Awards may be granted or awarded prior to such stockholder approval; <U>provided</U> that such Awards shall not be

under the Plan or under Awards granted or awarded hereunder are subject to compliance with all Applicable Law (including but not limited to state, federal and foreign securities law and margin requirements), and to such approvals by any listing,
regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. Any securities delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such restrictions, and the person acquiring such
securities shall, if requested by the Company, provide such assurances and representations to the Company as the Company may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all Applicable Law. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may
take whatever actions it deems necessary or appropriate to effect compliance with Applicable Law, including, without limitation, placing legends on share certificates and issuing stop-transfer notices to agents and registrars. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Administrator may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate Applicable Law. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded hereunder
shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to Applicable Law. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12.8 <U>Titles and Headings, References to Sections of the Code or Exchange

Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions required by Section&nbsp;409A. In that regard, to the extent any Award under the Plan or any other compensatory plan or
arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to Section&nbsp;409A, and such Award or other amount is payable on account of a Participant&#146;s Termination of Service (or any similarly defined term), then (a)&nbsp;such Award or
amount shall only be paid to the extent such Termination of Service qualifies as a &#147;separation from service&#148; as defined in Section&nbsp;409A, and (b)&nbsp;if such Award or amount is payable to a &#147;specified employee&#148; as defined in
Section&nbsp;409A then to the extent required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section&nbsp;409A, such Award or other compensatory payment shall not be payable prior to the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of the <FONT

Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section&nbsp;409A. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to
Section&nbsp;409A, the Administrator may (but is not obligated to), without a Holder&#146;s consent, adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Program and Award Agreement or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments,
policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (A)&nbsp;exempt the Award from Section&nbsp;409A and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the
benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (B)&nbsp;comply with the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under Section&nbsp;409A. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to the
tax treatment of any Award under Section&nbsp;409A or otherwise. The Company shall have no obligation under this Section&nbsp;12.10 or otherwise to take any action (whether or not described herein) to avoid the imposition of taxes, penalties or
interest under Section&nbsp;409A with respect to any Award and shall have no liability to any Holder or any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits under the Plan are determined to constitute
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-compliant,</FONT> &#147;nonqualified deferred compensation&#148; subject to the imposition of taxes, penalties and/or interest under Section&nbsp;409A. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">12.11 <U>Unfunded Status of Awards</U>. The Plan is intended to be an &#147;unfunded&#148; plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not
yet made to a Holder pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Program or Award Agreement shall give the Holder any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company or any Subsidiary. </P>

indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such member in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may
be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him
or her; <U>provided</U> he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be
exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such persons may be entitled pursuant to the Organizational Documents, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. </P>
