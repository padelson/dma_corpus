virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any
capital stock described below:

                  (a) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Belco (the "Old Belco Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 3.1(d)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.4125 of a share

accordance with Section 3.2, Belco Common Stock (the "Old Belco Common Stock
Merger Consideration") and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this

time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender Belco Common Stock Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Belco Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 3.1(a).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the

different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Belco Common

dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares.

                  (b) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share,

with Section 3.1(d)) shall be converted into the right to receive one share (the
"Westport Common Stock Exchange Ratio") of Belco Common Stock. All such Westport
Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and the holder
of a certificate ("Westport Common Stock Certificate") that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of Westport Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive, upon the surrender of such Westport Common Stock Certificate in
accordance with Section 3.2, Belco Common Stock (the "Westport Common Stock
Merger Consideration") to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section
3.1(b), without interest. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.1(b), each Westport Common Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Westport Common Stock Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section
3.1(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Westport Common Stock or Belco
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Westport Common
Stock Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares.

                  (c) Each share of the 6 1/2% Convertible Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Belco (the "Belco Preferred Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
shall not be affected by the Merger.

                  (d) All shares of Belco Common Stock that (i) are owned by
Belco as treasury stock or (ii) owned by Westport or any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no
stock of Belco or other consideration shall be delivered in

the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to
Belco Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Westport
Common Stock Certificate or Old Belco Common Stock Certificate with respect to
the Westport Common Stock Merger Consideration or Old Belco Common Stock Merger

of a fractional share of Old Belco Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 3.4 below, and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such Westport Common Stock Merger Consideration or Old Belco Common
Stock Merger Consideration in each case after giving effect to any required tax
withholding, and (ii) if the payment date for any dividend or distribution

                  (f) All Belco Common Stock issued upon the surrender of
Westport Common Stock Certificates or Old Belco Common Stock Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such certificates and the Westport
Common Stock or Old Belco Common Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented
thereby, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers effected on the stock transfer books of the Surviving

Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a
condition to such issuance that the Old Belco Common Stock Certificate or

or other taxes required as a result of such issuance to a Person other than the

only to Belco, as general creditors thereof, to exchange such Old Belco Common
Stock Certificates or Westport Common Stock Certificates, as the case may be, or
to pay amounts to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.1. If
outstanding Old Belco Common Stock Certificates or Westport Common Stock

shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Belco,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled

Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Old Belco Common Stock Certificates
or Westport Common Stock Certificates for any amount paid, or the Old Belco

abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

Stock Certificates or Westport Common Stock Certificates the Old Belco Common
Stock Merger Consideration or Westport Common Stock Merger Consideration, as the
case may be, and, if applicable, cash and unpaid dividends and other
distributions on any Old Belco Common Stock Merger Consideration or Westport

thereof, each Belco Stock Option shall, notwithstanding anything in the Belco

         Section 4.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violation. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the performance by Belco of its obligations hereunder will not:

                  (a) subject to obtaining the Belco Stockholders' Approval as
contemplated by Section 7.11 hereof, conflict with any provision of the articles
of incorporation or bylaws of Belco or the certificates of incorporation or

result in a Belco Material Adverse Effect;

                  (e) result in the creation of any Lien upon any material

Disclosure Schedule, result in any holder of any securities of Belco being
entitled to appraisal, dissenters' or similar rights.

Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and has heretofore made
available (provided that all documents filed by Belco electronically with the

Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (b) did not at the time they
were filed (or if amended or superceded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then as and on the date so amended or superceded) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of Belco's

the SEC.

reasonably likely to have a Belco Material Adverse Effect) or (m) any making of
a loan or an advance by Belco or any of its Subsidiaries not in the ordinary
course of business.

         Section 4.9 Taxes. Except as otherwise disclosed in Section 4.9 of the
Belco Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would not be reasonably likely,

adequate accrual for the payment of all material Taxes due with respect to any
period ending prior to or as of the Closing Date.

                  (d) No Audit by a Tax Authority is pending or threatened with
respect to any Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from, Belco or any Subsidiary.
No issue has been raised by any Tax Authority in any Audit of Belco or any of

jurisdiction where Belco does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                  (n) The unpaid Taxes of Belco do not exceed the reserve for
tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and tax income) set forth on the face of the
Belco Financial Statements (rather than in any notes thereto) as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of Belco in filing its Tax Returns.

                  (o) No election under any of sections 108, 168, 338, 441, 463,
472, 1017, 1033 or 4977 of the Code (or any predecessor provisions) has been

                  (q) Belco has not made any payments, and is not obligated to
make any payments, and is not a party to any agreement that under certain
circumstances could obligate it to make any payments that would not be
deductible by Belco by reason of either or both of sections 162(m) and 263 of
the Code.

                  (r) Except as set forth on Section 4.9(r) of the Belco
Disclosure Schedule, Belco will not, as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, be obligated to make a payment after the Closing
Date to an individual that would be a "parachute payment" as defined in Section
280G of the Code without regard to whether such payment is reasonable
compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the future.



                                       17

         Section 4.10 Property.

                  (a) Except for goods and other property sold, used or
otherwise disposed of since March 31, 2001 in the ordinary course of business,
Belco and its Subsidiaries have Good and Marketable Title (each as defined
below), for oil and gas purposes, in and to all the proved reserves reflected in
Belco Reserve Report and the Internal Reserve Report (as defined in Section
4.17) as owned by Belco and its Subsidiaries, and defensible title for oil and
gas purposes to all other properties, interests in properties and assets, real
and personal, reflected in the unaudited balance sheet of Belco as of March 31,
2001 (the "Belco Balance Sheet") as owned by Belco and its Subsidiaries, free
and clear of any Liens, except: (i) Liens associated with obligations reflected
in Belco Reserve Report, the Internal Reserve Report or Belco Balance Sheet;
(ii) Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) materialman's,
mechanic's, repairman's, employee's, contractor's, operator's, and other similar
liens, charges or encumbrances arising in the ordinary course of business (A) if
they have not been perfected pursuant to law, (B) if perfected, they have not
yet become due and payable or payment is being withheld as provided by law, or
(C) if their validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate action,
(iv) all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by any Governmental Authority in connection with the sale or conveyance
of oil and gas leases or interests if they are customarily obtained subsequent
to the sale or conveyance, and (v) such imperfections of title, easements and
Liens as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Belco Material Adverse Effect. All leases and other agreements
pursuant to which Belco or any of its Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires
or obtains operating rights affecting any real or personal property are in good
standing, valid and effective and all royalties, rentals and other payments due
by Belco to any lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been paid, except in
each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Belco Material Adverse Effect. All major items of operating
equipment of Belco and its Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and in a
state of reasonable maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Belco Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The term "Good and Marketable Title" shall, for purposes
of this Section 4.10, with respect to Belco and its Subsidiaries, mean such
title that: (1) is deducible of record (from the records of the applicable
parish or county or (A) in the case of federal leases, from the records of the
applicable office of the Minerals Management Service or Bureau of Land
Management, (B) in the case of Indian leases, from the applicable office of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, (C) in the case of state leases, from the records of
the applicable state land office) or is assignable to Belco or its Subsidiaries
out of an interest of record (as so defined) by reason of the performance by
Belco or its Subsidiaries of all operations required to earn an enforceable
right to such assignment; (2) is free from reasonable doubt to the end that a
prudent purchaser engaged in the business of the ownership, development and
operation of producing oil and gas properties with knowledge of all of the facts
and their legal bearing would be willing to accept and pay full value for the
same and a prudent lender would be willing to lend against it as collateral
without discount for title matters; (3) entitles Belco or its Subsidiaries to
receive not less than the interest





                                       18
<PAGE>   25

set forth in the Belco Reserve Report or the Internal Reserve Report with
respect to each proved property evaluated therein under the caption "Net Revenue
Interest" or "NRI" without reduction during the life of such property except as
stated in the Belco Reserve Report or the Internal Reserve Report; (4) obligates
Belco and its Subsidiaries to pay costs and expenses relating to each such
proved property in an amount not greater than the interest set forth under the
caption "Working Interest" or "WI" in the Belco Reserve Report or the Internal
Reserve Report with respect to such property without increase over the life of
such property except as shown on the Belco Reserve Report or the Internal
Reserve Report; and (5) does not restrict the ability of Belco or its
Subsidiaries to utilize the properties as currently intended.

         Section 4.11 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Belco SEC Reports
filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or Section 4.11
of the Belco Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would not have a Belco
Material Adverse Effect, there is no suit, claim, arbitration, action,
proceeding, investigation or review pending or, to Belco's knowledge, threatened
against Belco or any Subsidiaries of Belco. Neither Belco nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any order, judgment
or decree of any court or any other Governmental Authority from engaging in or
continuing any conduct or practice in connection with the business, assets or

ERISA that could reasonably be expected to result in a Belco Material Adverse
Effect; (iv) no disputes are pending or, to the knowledge of Belco or any Belco
ERISA Affiliate, threatened; (v) neither Belco nor any Belco ERISA Affiliate has

under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 4975(d) of
the Code that could reasonably be expected to result in a Belco Material Adverse

continuing liability for benefits other than benefits accrued to the date of
such termination. All contributions made or required to be made under any Belco
Benefit Plan meet the requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all

recorded on the books of Belco or a Belco ERISA Affiliate.

                  (c) No Belco Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer plan" (as
defined in section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (within
the meaning of section 413(c) of the Code). No event has occurred with respect
to Belco or a Belco ERISA Affiliate in connection with which Belco could be

breach or default thereunder (including with respect to the payment of premiums

occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse of time or both) would

of any similar state or local law, in each case that could reasonably be
expected to have a Belco Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 4.17 Reserve Reports.

                  (a) All information (including, without limitation, the
statement of the percentage of reserves from the oil and gas wells and other

authorizations of Governmental Authorities ("Permits") required or necessary to
construct, own, operate, use and/or maintain their properties and conduct their
operations as presently conducted, except for such Permits, the lack of which,

or warranty in this Section 4.18 is made with respect to Permits issued pursuant

legally binding obligations of Belco or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms subject to the
Enforceability Exception; (B) Belco is not in material breach or default (nor

Material Contract is in material breach or default with respect to, its
obligations thereunder, including with respect to payments or otherwise; (C) no
party to any Belco Material Contract has given written notice of any action to

Registration Statement, when it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be made therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

         Section 4.22 Intellectual Property. Belco or its Subsidiaries own, or
are licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all patents, patent rights,
trademarks, rights, trade names, trade name rights, service marks, service mark
rights, copyrights, technology, know-how, processes, seismic license or software
agreements and other proprietary intellectual property rights and computer
programs ("Intellectual Property") currently used in the conduct of the business
of Belco and its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to so own or otherwise
have the right to use such intellectual property would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Belco Material Adverse Effect.
No Person has notified either Belco or any of its Subsidiaries in writing that
their use of the Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any Person,
subject to such claims and infringements as do not, individually or in the
aggregate, give rise to any liability on the part of Belco and its Subsidiaries
that could have a Belco Material Adverse Effect, and, to Belco's knowledge, no
Person is infringing on any right of Belco or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to Belco's
knowledge, threatened that Belco or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing the
rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property.

                                   OF WESTPORT

         Westport represents and warrants to Belco that the statements contained
in this Article V are true and correct, except as specifically set forth herein
or in the disclosure schedule delivered by Westport to Belco on the date of this

shall be arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections contained in this Agreement. Westport represents and warrants to Belco

and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in the
jurisdictions set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Westport Disclosure Schedule,
which include each jurisdiction in which the character of Westport's properties
or the nature of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not result in a
Westport Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Westport has all requisite
corporate or other power and authority to own, use or lease its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.





                                       27

operations of Westport and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or that could
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Westport to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger; provided that
none of the following, alone or in combination, shall constitute a Westport

occurrence, state of facts or development arising out of, resulting from or
relating to (x) the economy in general, (y) the oil and gas exploration and

and other document (including exhibits and amendments thereto), including
without limitation its Annual Reports to Shareholders incorporated by reference
in certain of such reports, required to be filed with the SEC since October 19,

each of the Westport SEC Reports, including, without limitation, any financial

with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and (b) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or

date so amended or superceded) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of Westport's Subsidiaries is subject to

         Section 5.7 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in
the Westport SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement or in Section 5.7 of the Westport Disclosure Schedule, neither
Westport nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be likely to have a Westport Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.8 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the
Westport SEC Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, as set forth in Section 5.8 of the Westport Disclosure Schedule or as

Subsidiaries have conducted their business in all material respects in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices and there has not been (a) any
change or development, or combination of changes or developments that,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a Westport
Material Adverse Effect, (b) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any
dividend or other distribution with respect to any shares of capital stock of

Subsidiaries, (c) any amendment of any term of any outstanding security of
Westport or any of its Subsidiaries, (d) any change in any method of accounting

practices to those of Westport, (e) any split, combination or reclassification
of any of Westport's capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of any

modification, assignment, termination or relinquishment of rights under any
Westport Material Contract by Westport or any of its Subsidiaries other than
such modification, assignment, termination or relinquishment in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, or (h) any damage, destruction
or casualty loss, whether or not covered by insurance, that individually or in
the aggregate would be reasonably likely to have a Westport Material Adverse
Effect (it being understood that the availability of any insurance coverage
shall be taken into account in determining whether such damage, destruction or
loss would be reasonably likely to have a Westport Material Adverse Effect).

         Section 5.9 Taxes. Except as otherwise disclosed in Section 5.9 of the
Westport Disclosure Schedule and for matters that would not be reasonably
likely, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Westport Material Adverse
Effect:

                  (a) Westport and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed
(or have had timely filed on their behalf) or will file or cause to be timely
filed, all material Tax Returns required by applicable law to be filed by any of

thereto are or will be true, complete and correct in all material respects.

                  (b) Westport and each of its Subsidiaries have paid (or have
had paid on their behalf), or where payment is not yet due, have established (or

behalf and for their sole benefit and recourse), or will establish or cause to
be established on or before the Closing Date, an adequate accrual for the
payment of all material Taxes due with respect to any period ending prior to or
as of the Closing Date.

                  (c) No Audit by a Tax Authority is pending or threatened with
respect to any Tax Returns filed by, or Taxes due from, Westport or any
Subsidiary. No issue has been raised by any Tax Authority in any Audit of
Westport or any of its Subsidiaries that if raised with respect to any other
period not so audited could be expected to result in a material proposed
deficiency for any period not so audited. No material deficiency or adjustment
for any Taxes has been threatened, proposed, asserted or assessed against
Westport or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no liens for Taxes upon the
assets of Westport or any of its Subsidiaries, except liens for current Taxes
not yet delinquent.

                  (d) Neither Westport nor any of its Subsidiaries has given or
been requested to give any waiver of statutes of limitations relating to the
payment of Taxes or have executed powers of attorney with respect to Tax
matters, which will be outstanding as of the Closing Date.

                  (e) There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or
arrangements affecting any of Westport and its Subsidiaries. No payments are due
or will become due by any of Westport and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any such
agreement or arrangement or any tax indemnification agreement.

                  (f) Neither Westport nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been
a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Westport) or (ii) has any
liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than any of Westport and its
Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract, or otherwise.

                  (g) Section 5.9(g) of the Westport Disclosure Schedule lists
(i) all Tax Returns filed with respect to Westport for the prior three tax
years, (ii) the taxable years of Westport for which the statutes of limitations
with respect to Taxes have not expired, and (iii) those years for which
examinations have been completed, those years for which examinations are
presently being conducted, and those years for which examinations have not yet
been initiated.

assessed against or agreed to by Westport for the prior three tax years.

in material violation of any federal, state, local or foreign tax law or the
rules and regulations of any Tax Authority.

into any agreement or arrangement with any Tax Authority that requires any of
Westport and its Subsidiaries to take any action or to refrain from taking any
action.

                  (k) No closing agreement pursuant to section 7121 of the Code
(or any predecessor provision) or any similar provision of any state, local, or
foreign law has been entered into by or with respect to Westport.

                  (l) No claim has ever been made by a Tax Authority in a
jurisdiction where Westport does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                  (m) The unpaid Taxes of Westport do not exceed the reserve for
tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and tax income) set forth on the face of the
Westport Financial Statements (rather than in any notes thereto) as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of Westport in filing its Tax Returns.

                  (n) Except as set forth on Section 5.9(n) of the Westport
Disclosure Schedule, No election under any of sections 108, 168, 338, 441, 463,
472, 1017, 1033 or 4977 of the Code (or any predecessor provisions) has been
made or filed by or with respect to Westport. No consent to the application of

required to include any amount in income for any taxable period as a result of a
change in accounting or pursuant to any agreement with any Tax Authority with
respect to any prior taxable period. There is no application pending with any
Tax Authority requesting permission for any changes in any accounting method of
Westport. The Internal Revenue Service has not proposed any such adjustment or
change in accounting method with respect to Westport or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (p) Westport has not made any payments, and is not obligated
to make any payments, and is not a party to any agreement that under certain
circumstances could obligate it to make any payments that would not be
deductible by Westport by reason of either or both of sections 162(m) and 263 of
the Code.

                  (q) Except as set forth on Section 5.9(q) of the Westport
Disclosure Schedule, Westport will not, as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, be obligated to make a payment after the Closing
Date to an individual that would be a "parachute payment" as defined in section
280G of the Code without regard to whether such payment is reasonable
compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in the future.

                  (r) All monies required to be withheld by Westport and paid to
any Tax Authority for all Taxes have been collected or withheld and either paid
to the respective Tax Authority or set aside in accounts for such purpose.

         Section 5.10 Property.

                  (a) Except for goods and other property sold, used or
otherwise disposed of since March 31, 2001 in the ordinary course of business,
Westport and its Subsidiaries have Good and Marketable Title (as defined below),
for oil and gas purposes, in and to all the proved reserves reflected in the
Westport Reserve Report (as defined in Section 5.17) as owned by the Westport
and its Subsidiaries, and defensible title for oil and gas purposes to all other
properties,






                                       34
<PAGE>   41

interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in the
unaudited balance sheet of Westport as of March 31, 2001 (the "Westport Balance
Sheet") as owned by Westport and its Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens,
except: (i) Liens associated with obligations reflected in the Westport Reserve
Report or the Westport Balance Sheet; (ii) Liens for current taxes not yet due
and payable, (iii) materialman's, mechanic's, repairman's, employee's,
contractor's, operator's, and other similar liens, charges or encumbrances
arising in the ordinary course of business (A) if they have not been perfected
pursuant to law, (B) if perfected, they have not yet become due and payable or
payment is being withheld as provided by law, or (C) if their validity is being
contested in good faith by appropriate action, (iv) all rights to consent by,
required notices to, filings with, or other actions by any Governmental
Authority in connection with the sale or conveyance of oil and gas leases or
interests if they are customarily obtained subsequent to the sale or conveyance,
and (v) such imperfections of title, easements and Liens as would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Westport Material
Adverse Effect. All leases and other agreements pursuant to which Westport or
any of its Subsidiaries leases or otherwise acquires or obtains operating rights
affecting any real or personal property are in good standing, valid and
effective and all royalties, rentals and other payments due by Westport to any
lessor of any such oil and gas leases have been paid, except in each case, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Westport Material Adverse Effect. All major items of operating equipment of
Westport and its Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and in a state of
reasonable maintenance and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Westport Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) The term "Good and Marketable Title" shall, for purposes
of this Section 5.10, with respect to Westport and its Subsidiaries, mean such
title that: (1) is deducible of record (from the records of the applicable
parish or county or (A) in the case of federal leases, from the records of the
applicable office of the Minerals Management Service or Bureau of Land
Management, (B) in the case of Indian leases, from the applicable office of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, (C) in the case of state leases, from the records of
the applicable state land office) or is assignable to Westport or its
Subsidiaries out of an interest of record (as so defined) by reason of the
performance by Westport or its Subsidiaries of all operations required to earn
an enforceable right to such assignment; (2) is free from reasonable doubt to
the end that a prudent purchaser engaged in the business of the ownership,
development and operation of producing oil and gas properties with knowledge of
all of the facts and their legal bearing would be willing to accept and pay full
value for the same and a prudent lender would be willing to lend against it as
collateral without discount for title matters; (3) entitles Westport or its
Subsidiaries to receive not less than the interest set forth in the Westport
Reserve Report with respect to each proved property evaluated therein under the
caption "Net Revenue Interest" or "NRI" without reduction during the life of
such property except as stated in the Westport Reserve Report, (4) obligates
Westport and its Subsidiaries to pay costs and expenses relating to each such
proved property in an amount not greater than the interest set forth under the
caption "Working Interest" or "WI" in the Westport Reserve Report with respect
to such property without increase over the life of such property except as shown
on the Westport Reserve Report; and (5) does not restrict the ability of
Westport or its Subsidiaries to utilize the properties as currently intended.

         Section 5.11 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Westport SEC
Reports filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement or
Section 5.11 of the Westport Disclosure

Schedule and for matters that would not have a Westport Material Adverse Effect,
there is no suit, claim, arbitration, action, proceeding, investigation or
review pending or, to Westport's knowledge, threatened against Westport or any
Subsidiaries of Westport. Neither Westport nor any of its Subsidiaries, has been
permanently or temporarily enjoined by any order, judgment or decree of any
court or any other Governmental Authority from engaging in or continuing any
conduct or practice in connection with the business, assets or properties of
Westport or such Subsidiary, nor, to the knowledge of Westport, is Westport or
any Subsidiary of Westport under investigation by any Governmental Authority.
Except as disclosed in the Westport SEC Reports filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement or Section 5.11 of the Westport Disclosure
Schedule, there is not in existence any order, judgment, injunction, award,
stipulation or decree of any court or other tribunal or other agency or by
arbitration enjoining or requiring Westport or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action of any kind with respect to its business, assets or properties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this Section
5.11 is made with respect to Environmental Laws, which are covered exclusively
by the provisions set forth in Section 5.13.

         Section 5.12 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.

                  (a) Section 5.12(a) of the Westport Disclosure Schedule
contains a true and complete list of the employee benefit plans or arrangements
of any type (including but not limited to plans described in section 3(3) of
ERISA), sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Westport or any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, which together with Westport would be
deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c) or (m) of
the Code or section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (a "Westport ERISA Affiliate") within
six years prior to the Effective Time ("Westport Benefit Plans"). Copies of all
Westport Benefit Plans (including all amendments and related trusts, insurance
policies and similar funding vehicles), summary plan descriptions, determination
letters, and most recent Form 5500's have been provided or made available to
Belco.

                  (b) With respect to each Westport Benefit Plan: (i) if
intended to qualify under section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code, such plan
satisfies the requirements of such sections, has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to its
qualification, and its related trust has been determined to be exempt from tax
under section 501(a) of the Code and, to the knowledge of Westport, nothing has
occurred since the date of such letter to adversely affect such qualification or
exemption; (ii) each such plan has been administered in substantial compliance
with its terms and applicable law, except for any noncompliance with respect to
any such plan that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Westport
Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither Westport nor any Westport ERISA Affiliate
has engaged in, and Westport and each Westport ERISA Affiliate do not have any
knowledge of any Person that has engaged in, any transaction or acted or failed
to act in any manner that would subject Westport or any Westport ERISA Affiliate
to any liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Westport Material Adverse Effect; (iv) no
disputes are pending, or, to the knowledge of Westport or any Westport ERISA
Affiliate, threatened; (v) neither Westport nor any Westport ERISA Affiliate has
engaged in, and Westport and each Westport ERISA Affiliate do not have any
knowledge of any Person that has engaged in, any transaction in violation of
Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code for which no
exemption exists under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(c) of the Code or



                                       36
<PAGE>   43

Section 4975(d) of the Code that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Westport Material Adverse Effect; (vi) there have been no "reportable events"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30 day notice
requirement of ERISA has not been waived by the PBGC; (vii) all contributions
due have been made on a timely basis (within, where applicable, the time limit
established under section 302 of ERISA or Code section 412); (viii) no notice of
intent to terminate such plan has been given under Section 4041 of ERISA and no
proceeding has been instituted under section 4042 of ERISA to terminate such
plan; and (ix) except for defined benefit plans (if applicable), such plan may
be terminated on a prospective basis without any continuing liability for
benefits other than benefits accrued to the date of such termination. All
contributions made or required to be made under any Westport Benefit Plan meet
the requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all contributions which
are required and which have not been made have been properly recorded on the
books of Westport or a Westport ERISA Affiliate.

                  (c) No Westport Benefit Plan is a "multi-employer plan" (as
defined in section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a "multiple employer plan" (within
the meaning of section 413(c) of the Code). No event has occurred with respect
to Westport or a Westport ERISA Affiliate in connection with which Westport
could be subject to any liability, lien or encumbrance with respect to any
Westport Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan described in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained, sponsored or contributed to by a Westport ERISA Affiliate
under ERISA or the Code.

                  (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.12(d) of the Westport
Disclosure Schedule, no employees of Westport or any of its Subsidiaries are
covered by any severance or retention plan or similar arrangement.

any written notice from any Governmental Authority or third party or, to the
knowledge of Westport, any other communication alleging or concerning any
material violation by Westport or any of its Subsidiaries of, or responsibility
or liability of Westport or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Environmental
Law. There are no pending, or to the knowledge of Westport, threatened, claims,
suits, actions, proceedings or investigations with respect to the businesses or
operations of






                                       37

Westport or any of its Subsidiaries alleging or concerning any material
violation of or responsibility or liability under any Environmental Law that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected to have a Westport Material
Adverse Effect, nor does Westport have any knowledge of any fact or condition
that could give rise to such a claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation.

                  (d) Westport and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all
material approvals, permits, licenses, registrations and similar type
authorizations from all Governmental Authorities under all Environmental Laws
with respect to the operation of the businesses of Westport and its
Subsidiaries; there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Westport, threatened,
actions, proceedings or investigations seeking to modify, revoke or deny renewal
of any of such approvals, permits, licenses registrations and authorizations;
and Westport does not have knowledge of any fact or condition that is reasonably
likely to give rise to any action, proceeding or investigation to modify, revoke
or deny renewal of any of such approvals, permits, licenses, registrations and
authorizations.

                  (e) Without in any way limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the knowledge of Westport, (i) all offsite locations where
Westport or any of its Subsidiaries has transported, released, discharged,
stored, disposed or arranged for the disposal of pollutants, contaminants,
hazardous wastes or toxic substances are licensed disposal sites as required by

or stored at any property owned, leased or operated by Westport or any of its
Subsidiaries except in compliance with Environmental Laws.

                  (f) There has been no discharge, release or disposal at any of
the properties owned or operated by Westport, its Subsidiaries, or a predecessor
in interest, or to the knowledge of Westport, at any disposal or treatment
facility which received Hazardous Substances generated by Westport, its
Subsidiaries, or any predecessor in interest which could reasonably be expected
to result in liabilities that have a Westport Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g) To Westport's knowledge, no pending claims have been
asserted or threatened to be asserted against Westport or its Subsidiaries for
any personal injury (including wrongful death) or property damage (real or
personal) arising out of exposure to Hazardous Substances used, handled,
generated, transported or disposed by Westport or its Subsidiaries at property
owned or operated by Westport or its Subsidiaries, except as could not
reasonably be expected to result in liabilities that have a Westport Material
Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.14 Compliance with Applicable Laws. Neither Westport nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental
Authority that any such business has been or is being, conducted in violation of
or default with respect to any applicable federal, state, local or foreign
statute, law, rule, order, decree or regulation, including, without limitation
any filing or reporting requirement thereunder with respect to the conduct of
its business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for
violations or defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Westport Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or





                                       38

warranty in this Section 5.14 is made with respect to Environmental Laws, which
are covered exclusively by the provisions set forth in Section 5.13.

         Section 5.15 Insurance. Section 5.15 of the Westport Disclosure
Schedule lists each of the insurance policies relating to Westport or its
Subsidiaries which are currently in effect. Westport has made available to Belco
a true and correct copy of each such policy or the binder therefor. With respect
to each such insurance policy or binder, none of Westport or any of its
Subsidiaries is in breach or default thereunder (including with respect to the
payment of premiums or the giving of notices), and to Westport's knowledge,
there has not been any occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse
of time or both) would constitute such a breach or default or permit
termination, modification or acceleration under the policy, except for such
breaches or defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Westport Material Adverse Effect. Section
5.15 of the Westport Disclosure Schedule describes any self-insurance
arrangements affecting Westport or its Subsidiaries. The insurance policies
listed in Section 5.15 of the Westport Disclosure Schedule include all policies
which are required in connection with the operation of the businesses of

number to trigger application of any similar state or local law, in each case
that could reasonably be expected to have a Westport Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.17 Reserve Reports.

                  (a) All information (including, without limitation, the
statement of the percentage of reserves from the oil and gas wells and other
interests evaluated therein to which Westport or its Subsidiaries are entitled
and the percentage of the costs and expenses related to such wells or interests
to be borne by Westport or its Subsidiaries) supplied to Netherland, Sewell &
Associates, Inc. and Ryder Scott Company Petroleum Engineers by or on behalf of
Westport and its Subsidiaries that was material to such firms' estimates of
proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Interests of
Westport and its Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the proved
oil and gas reserve reports concerning the Oil and Gas Interests of Westport and
its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 by such engineering firms

modified or amended prior to the issuance of the Westport Reserve Report) true
and correct in all material respects and Westport has no knowledge of any
material errors in such information that existed at the time of such issuance.
Except for changes (including changes in commodity prices) generally affecting

Adverse Effect.

its Subsidiaries which increase the royalty, overriding royalty interest, net
profits interest, or similar lease burdens.

Subsidiaries are not subject to (i) any instrument or agreement evidencing or
related to indebtedness for borrowed money, whether directly or indirectly, or
(ii) any agreement not entered into in the ordinary course of business in which
the amount involved is in excess of $1,500,000. Except for matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably expected to have a
Westport Material Adverse Effect, with respect to the Westport Material
Contracts, (A) all Westport Material Contracts are in full force and effect and
are the valid and legally binding obligations of Westport or its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, and are enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms subject to the Enforceability Exception; (B) Westport is not in material
breach or default (nor does there exist any condition which upon the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both would reasonably be expected to cause such
a breach or default) with respect to, and to the knowledge of Westport, no other
party to any Westport Material Contract is in material breach or default with
respect to, its obligations thereunder, including with respect to payments or
otherwise; (C) no party to any Westport Material Contract has given written
notice of any action to terminate, cancel, rescind or procure a judicial
reformation thereof; and (D) no Westport Material Contract contains any
provision that prevents Westport or any of its Subsidiaries from owning,
managing and operating the Oil and Gas Interests of Westport and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with historical practices.

                  (c) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in
the Westport Reserve Report and except as set forth in Section 5.18(c) of the

         Section 5.19 Permits. Immediately prior to the Effective Time and
except for Customary Post-Closing Consents, Westport or its Subsidiaries will
hold all of the Permits required or necessary to construct, run, operate, use
and/or maintain their properties and conduct their operations as presently
conducted, except for such Permits, the lack of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Westport Material Adverse Effect; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty in this
Section 5.19 is made with respect to Permits issued pursuant to Environmental
Laws, which are covered exclusively by the provisions set forth in Section 5.13.

         Section 5.20 Required Stockholder Vote or Consent. The only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Westport's capital stock that is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is the approval and adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Westport Common Stock on the applicable record date

bylaws of Westport in order for Westport to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 5.21 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement. None
of the information to be supplied by Westport for inclusion in (a) the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be filed by Belco and Westport with the SEC, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, or (b) the Registration Statement to be filed
by Belco with the SEC in connection with the Merger, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, will, at the respective times such documents are filed,
and, in the case of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, at the time the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
stockholders of Belco and Westport, at the time such stockholders vote on
approval of this Agreement and at the Effective Time, and, in the case of the
Registration Statement, when it becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be made therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

         Section 5.22 Intellectual Property. Westport or its Subsidiaries own,
or are licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual Property
currently used in the conduct of the business of Westport and its Subsidiaries,
except where the failure to so own or otherwise have the right to use such
intellectual property would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Westport Material Adverse Effect. No Person has notified
either Westport or any of its Subsidiaries in writing that their use of the
Intellectual Property infringes on the rights of any Person, subject to such
claims and infringements as do not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise
to any liability on the part of Westport and its Subsidiaries that could have a
Westport Material Adverse Effect, and, to Westport's knowledge, no Person is
infringing on any right of Westport or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
any such Intellectual Property. No claims are pending or, to Westport's
knowledge, threatened that Westport or any of its Subsidiaries is infringing the
rights of any Person with regard to any Intellectual Property.

         Section 5.23 Hedging; Derivatives. As of the date of this Agreement,
Section 5.23 of the Westport Disclosure Schedule sets forth for the periods
shown obligations of Westport and each of its Subsidiaries for the delivery of
Hydrocarbons attributable to any of the properties of Westport or any of its
Subsidiaries in the future on account of prepayment, advance payment,
take-or-pay or similar obligations without then or thereafter being entitled to
receive full value therefor. Except as set forth in Section 5.23 of the Westport
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Westport nor any
of its Subsidiaries is bound by futures, hedge, swap, collar, put, call, floor,
cap, option, interest rate swap or other contracts that are intended to benefit
from, relate to or reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the price of
commodities, including Hydrocarbons or securities.

         Section 5.24 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment banker (other
than Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, the fees and expenses of which will
be paid by Westport) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's fee or other fee or
commission payable by Westport or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and
on behalf of Westport or any of its Subsidiaries. True and correct copies of all
agreements and engagement letters currently in effect with Credit Suisse First
Boston Corporation have been provided to Belco.

         Section 5.25 Tax Matters. To its knowledge, after consulting with its
Tax counsel, neither Westport nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to
take any action that could





                                       42
<PAGE>   49

reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from constituting a transaction
qualifying as a reorganization under section 368(a) of the Code.

         Section 5.26 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of Westport has
received a written opinion from Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation dated the
date of this Agreement to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the
Belco Common Stock Exchange Ratio is fair to Westport from a financial point of
view. A true and complete copy of such opinion has been given to Belco.

         Section 5.27 Takeover Laws. Westport and the Board of Directors of
Westport have each taken all action required to be taken by it in order to
exempt this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby from, and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from, the
requirements of any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate
transaction," "business combination" or other antitakeover laws and regulations
of the State of Delaware.

                  (u) Belco will not, and will not permit any of its

         Section 6.2 Conduct of Business by Westport Pending the Merger. From

writing, or except as set forth in the Westport Disclosure Schedule or as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, Westport shall conduct, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to conduct, its business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and shall use, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use, all reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organizations and relationships with third parties and to keep available the
services of its present officers and key employees, subject to the terms of this
Agreement. Except as set forth in the Westport Disclosure Schedule or as
otherwise permitted under this Agreement, and without limiting the generality of
the preceding sentence, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, without
the written consent of Belco (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld):

                                       46

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

         Section 7.1 Access and Information. The parties shall upon reasonable
notice each afford to the other and to the other's financial advisors, legal
counsel, accountants, consultants, financing sources, and other authorized
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time to all of its books, records, properties,
contracts, leases, plants and personnel and, during such period, each shall
furnish promptly to the other (a) a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed or received by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws, and (b) all other information as such other party
reasonably may request, provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section
7.1 shall affect any representations or warranties made herein or the conditions
to the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the Merger. Each
party shall hold in confidence all nonpublic information until such time as such
information is otherwise publicly available and, if this Agreement is
terminated, each party will deliver to the other all documents, work papers and
other materials (including copies) obtained by such party or on its behalf from
the other party as a result of this Agreement or in connection herewith, whether
so obtained before or after the execution hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Confidentiality Agreement dated February 9, 2001 between Westport and Belco
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement.

         Section 7.2 No Solicitation of Transactions.

         (a) Belco agrees that (i) it and its officers, directors and employees
shall not, (ii) Belco Subsidiaries and Belco Subsidiaries' officers and
directors shall not and (iii) it shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that its and Belco Subsidiaries' agents and representatives shall not, (A)
directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate
any inquiries relating to or the making of any Acquisition Proposal or (B)
directly or indirectly, continue, enter into or engage in any negotiations or
discussions concerning any Acquisition Proposal with or furnish any information
relating to Belco or any Belco Subsidiary or provide access to the properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data of Belco or any Belco
Subsidiary to, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the





                                       47
<PAGE>   54

foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Belco or its Board
of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
(ii) prior to the Belco Stockholders' Approval being obtained, providing access
to properties, books and records and providing information or data in response
to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of Belco receives from the Person
so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(except for such changes specifically necessary in order for Belco to be able to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement) (provided that all such
written information is also provided on a prior or substantially concurrent
basis to Westport), or (iii) prior to the Belco Stockholders' Approval being
obtained, engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; if and only to the
extent that in connection with the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), (1) Belco's
Board of Directors (after consultation with its independent legal counsel)
determines in good faith that such action is legally advisable for the Board of
Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to Belco's stockholders under
applicable law, (2) such Acquisition Proposal is not subject to any financing
contingencies or is, in the good faith judgment of Belco's Board of Directors
(after consultation with its financial advisor), reasonably capable of being
financed by such other Person, and (3) Belco's Board of Directors determines in
good faith after consultation with its independent legal counsel and financial
advisor (taking into account among other things the legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal, the Person making the proposal, the
likelihood of consummation and the time to complete such transaction) that such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of being completed and, if
consummated, may reasonably be expected to result in a transaction more
favorable to Belco's stockholders than the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being referred to in
this Agreement as a "Superior Proposal"). Belco agrees that it will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such
Person (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information
about Belco or any Belco Subsidiary that was furnished by or on behalf of Belco
to return or destroy all such information. Belco shall also notify Westport
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any indication of interest in making an Acquisition Proposal after
the date hereof, which notice shall include the identity of the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal or indication and the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal or indication (including any subsequent material
amendment or modification to such terms and conditions). Belco shall keep
Westport informed in all material respects of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal.

                  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Belco nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Westport) or
propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Westport) the
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors of Belco
or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger, or recommend, or propose
publicly to recommend, the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acquisition Proposal made by Westport), (ii) adopt or approve, or
propose publicly to adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acquisition Proposal made by Westport), (iii) cause or permit Belco to enter
into any letter of intent,





                                       48
<PAGE>   55

memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or similar agreement which relates to or is reasonably likely to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 7.2(a)) or (iv) agree or resolve to take any of the actions
prohibited by clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary, if, at any time prior to Belco
Stockholder's Approval being obtained, Belco's Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and independent legal
counsel, in response to an Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and that
did not otherwise result from a breach of Section 7.2, that such proposal is a
Superior Proposal, Belco or its Board of Directors may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(f) and may take such actions as may be reasonably
necessary to facilitate compliance with the match provisions thereof.

                  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
means any proposal or offer with respect to (i) any tender offer or exchange
offer, (ii) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
sale of substantially all of the assets, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Belco or of any
Belco Subsidiary or Belco Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets or earning power
of Belco, (iii) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of more than
15% of the consolidated assets of Belco or (iv) any acquisition or purchase,
direct or indirect, that, if consummated, would result in any Person
beneficially owning securities constituting more than 15% of any class or series
of equity or voting securities of Belco or of any Belco Subsidiary or Belco
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 15% of the consolidated assets or earning power of Belco (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

         Section 7.3 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

                  (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of Westport, Belco or their respective
Subsidiaries or an employee of Westport, Belco or any of their respective
Subsidiaries who acts as a fiduciary under any of Westport's Benefit Plans or
Belco's Benefit Plans (each an "Indemnified Party") against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement (provided that any such settlement is effected with
the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation, which will not be
unreasonably withheld)) arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions
in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the
full extent permitted under Nevada law (or the laws of such other state in which
the Surviving Corporation may subsequently be domesticated) or the Surviving
Corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws and Westport's and Belco's
written indemnification agreements in effect at the date hereof, including
provisions therein relating to the advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any action or suit; provided, that in the event any claim or claims
are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification
in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any
and all such claims; and provided, further, that any determination required to
be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the
standards set






                                       49
<PAGE>   56

forth under Nevada law (or the laws of such other state in which the Surviving
Corporation may subsequently be domesticated), the Surviving Corporation's
articles of incorporation or bylaws or such agreements, as the case may be,
shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Party; and provided, further, that nothing
herein shall impair any rights or obligations of any Indemnified Party. In the
event that any claim or claims are brought against any Indemnified Party
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), such Indemnified Party may
select counsel for the defense of such claim, which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to Westport or Belco, as applicable (if selected prior to the
Effective Time), and the Surviving Corporation (if selected after the Effective
Time).

                  (b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain Westport's and
Belco's existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policies for a
period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, but only to the
extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided,
that (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms no less advantageous to such
former directors or officers; (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or
lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time
and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required in order to maintain
such policies to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the greater of (1)
the aggregate last annual premium paid by each of Westport and Belco with
respect to their existing policies and (2) the aggregate annual premium for each
of Westport and Belco with respect to their policies for the year in which the
Closing occurs (the "Cap"); and provided further, that, if equivalent coverage
cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in
excess of the Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall maintain policies that
provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Cap.

                  (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation contained in this Section 7.3 shall be
binding upon the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation. In the
event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each
case, proper provision shall be made so that successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 7.3.

                  (d) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 7.3 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this Section 7.3 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 7.3 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section
7.3, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 7.3).

         Section 7.4 Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each party hereto agrees to use all reasonable efforts to obtain
all consents, approvals and waivers of any Governmental Authority or any other
Person and to do or cause to be done all other things necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
agree to take such further action to deliver or cause to be delivered to each
other at the Closing and at such other times thereafter as shall be reasonably
agreed by such additional agreements or instruments as any of them may
reasonably request for the purpose of





                                       50
<PAGE>   57

carrying out this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The
parties shall afford each other access to all information, documents, records
and personnel who may be necessary for any party to comply with laws or
regulations (including without limitation the filing and payment of Taxes and
handling Tax Audits), to fulfill its obligations with respect to indemnification
hereunder or to defend itself against suits or claims of others. Westport and
Belco shall duly preserve all files, records or any similar items of Westport or
Belco received or obtained as a result of the Merger with the same care and for
the same period of time as it would preserve its own similar assets.

         Section 7.5 Expenses.

                  (a) Except as provided in Section 10.2, all Expenses (as
defined below) incurred by the parties hereto shall be borne solely and entirely
by the party that has incurred such Expenses; provided that all Expenses
(including any fees and expenses of accountants, experts, and consultants, but
excluding the fees and expenses of legal counsel and investment bankers) related
to preparing, printing, filing and mailing the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees incurred in
connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus (other
than the HSR Act), shall be borne solely and entirely by Westport; provided,
further, that, except as set forth in Section 10.2, if this Agreement is
terminated for any reason, then the allocable share of Westport and Belco for
all Expenses (including any fees and expenses of accountants, experts, and
consultants, but excluding the fees and expenses of legal counsel and investment
bankers) related to preparing, printing, filing and mailing the Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and all SEC and other regulatory
filing fees incurred in connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the HSR Act (including filing fees under the HSR Act
paid or payable by Westport's stockholders), shall be allocated one-half each.

                  (b) "Expenses" as used in this Agreement shall include all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including, without
limitation, all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment
bankers, financial advisors, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its
affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with, arising out
of or related to this Agreement, the Merger or the consummation of all of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the
preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Registration Statement, the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the solicitation of stockholder approvals and
requisite HSR filings).

         Section 7.6 Cooperation. Subject to compliance with applicable law,
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the parties hereto shall
confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the
other parties to report operational matters of materiality and the general
status of ongoing operations and shall promptly provide the other party or its
counsel with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

         Section 7.7 Publicity. Neither Belco, Westport nor any of their
respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consultation of the other
party, except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement





                                       51
<PAGE>   58

with a national securities exchange and will use reasonable efforts to provide
copies of such release or other announcement to the other party hereto, and give
due consideration to such comments as such other party may have, prior to such
release.

         Section 7.8 Filings. Each party hereto shall make all filings required
to be made by such party in connection herewith or desirable to achieve the
purposes contemplated hereby, and shall cooperate as needed with respect to any
such filing by any other party hereto.

         Section 7.9 Employee Matters; Benefit Plans.

                  (a) The Surviving Corporation shall take all reasonable
actions necessary or appropriate to permit the employees who as of the Effective
Time were employed by Belco and who continue to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time (the "Retained Employees") to continue to
participate from and after the Effective Time in the employee benefit plans or
arrangements in which such Retained Employees were participating immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving
Corporation may permit any such employee benefit plan or arrangement to be
terminated or discontinued on or after the Effective Time, provided that the
Surviving Corporation shall (a) take all reasonable actions necessary or
appropriate to permit the Retained Employees participating in such employee
benefit plan or arrangement to immediately thereafter participate in employee
benefit plans or arrangements substantially comparable to those maintained with
respect to other Surviving Corporation employees other than the Retained
Employees (the "Replacement Plans"), (b) with respect to a Replacement Plan that
is a group health plan (i) credit such Retained Employees, for the year during
which participation in the Replacement Plan begins, with any deductibles and
copayments already incurred during such year under the terminated or
discontinued group health plan and (ii) waive any preexisting condition
limitations applicable to the Retained Employees (and their eligible dependents)
under the Replacement Plan to the extent that a Retained Employee's (or
dependent's) condition would not have operated as a preexisting condition under
the terminated or discontinued group health plan, and (c)(1) cause each
Replacement Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan (as such term is
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) intended to be qualified under Section 401 of
the Code to be amended to provide that the Retained Employees shall receive
credit for participation and vesting purposes under such plan for their period
of employment with Belco and its Subsidiaries and their predecessors to the
extent such predecessor employment was recognized by Belco and its Subsidiaries
and (2) credit the Retained Employees under each other Replacement Plan that is
not described in the preceding clause for their period of employment with Belco,
its Subsidiaries and their predecessors to the extent such predecessor
employment was recognized by Belco or its Subsidiaries. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding award (including restricted stock, phantom stock, stock
equivalents and stock units) ("Westport Award") under any employee incentive or
benefit plans, programs or arrangements and non-employee director plans
presently maintained by Westport which provide for grants of equity-based awards
shall be amended or converted into a similar instrument of the Surviving
Corporation, in each case with such adjustments to the terms of such Westport
Awards as are appropriate to preserve the value inherent in such Westport Awards
with no detrimental effects on the holders thereof.

                  (b) Prior to the Closing, the Board of Directors of Westport
shall, by resolution duly adopted by such Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof,






                                       52
<PAGE>   59

approve and adopt, for purposes of exemption from "short-swing" profit liability
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, (i) the disposition and the conversion
at the Effective Time of the shares of Westport Common Stock held by officers,
directors and affiliates of Westport into shares of Belco Common Stock as a
result of the conversion of shares in the Merger (ii) the assumption by Belco of
the Westport Stock Options of the officers, directors and affiliates of Westport
and (iii) the deemed grant of options to purchase Belco Common Stock under the
Westport Stock Options (as converted pursuant to Section 3.3) for purposes of
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. Such resolution shall set forth the name of
applicable "insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and, for
each "insider," the number of shares of Westport Common Stock to be converted

the Westport Stock Plans or any restricted stock purchase or stock issuance
agreement to which Westport is a party and the vesting schedule or restrictions
applicable to those shares are not to vest or lapse on an accelerated basis in
connection with the Merger, then the shares of Belco Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Westport Common Stock in the Merger shall also be
unvested and subject to the same vesting schedule in effect for the unvested
shares of Westport Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
certificates representing such shares of Belco Common Stock may accordingly bear

Agreement, Belco and Westport shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy

their reasonable best efforts to accomplish this preparation and filing within

the SEC the Registration Statement in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
be included as a prospectus, provided that Belco may delay the filing of the

comments of the SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
Registration Statement, to furnish all information required to prepare the Proxy

in connection therewith, re-solicit proxies. Westport shall advise Belco and
Belco shall advise Westport, as applicable, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement shall become effective or

its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, any Acquisition Proposal, then Belco shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day after entering into such agreement or consummating
an Acquisition Proposal), pay Westport an amount equal to the Termination Fee

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,

         Section 11.10 Disclosure Schedules. The disclosures made on any
disclosure schedule, including the Belco Disclosure Schedule and the Westport
Disclosure Schedule, with respect to any representation or warranty shall be
deemed to be made with respect to any other representation or warranty requiring
the same or similar disclosure to the extent that the relevance of such
disclosure to other representations and warranties is evident from the face of
the disclosure schedule. The inclusion of any matter on any disclosure schedule
will not be deemed an admission by any party that such listed matter is material
or that such listed matter has or would have a Belco Material Adverse Effect or
a Westport Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

         Section 11.11 Amendments and Supplements. At any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
respective stockholders of Westport and the Belco and prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in writing by Westport and
the Belco with respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement, except
as otherwise provided by law; provided, however, that following approval of the
issuance of Westport Common Stock contemplated hereby by the stockholders of
Westport there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof with
respect to the Common Stock Exchange Ratio that is adverse to the stockholders
of Westport without further approval by the stockholders of Westport, and
following approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Belco there
shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof with respect to the
Common Stock Exchange Ratio that is adverse to the stockholders of the Belco
without further approval by the stockholders of the Belco.

         Section 11.12 Extensions, Waivers, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, either party may:

                  (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other party;

                  (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto; or

                  (c) subject to the proviso of Section 11.11 waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained herein.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Westport or the
Belco in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.
