Executive agrees that if any covenant contained in this Section 7 is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to contain limitations as to time, geographic area, or scope of activity that are not reasonable and impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill or other business interest of the Company, then the court may reform such covenant to the extent necessary to cause the limitations contained in such covenant as to time, geographic area, and scope of activity to be restrained to be reasonable and to impose a restraint that is not greater than necessary to protect the goodwill and other business interests of the Company and to enforce the covenant as reformed. </FONT></P>

All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Company. Any Gross-Up Payment, as determined pursuant to this Section 8, shall be paid by the Company to Executive within five days of the receipt of the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by Executive, it will, at the same time as it makes that determination, furnish the Company and Executive with a written opinion that failure to report the Excise Tax on Executive&#146;s applicable federal income tax return will not result in the imposition </FONT></P>

As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made &#147;Underpayment&#148;), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 8(c) and Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive.</FONT></P>
<P align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=serif size=2>(c) Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment.

Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, Executive shall: </FONT></P>
