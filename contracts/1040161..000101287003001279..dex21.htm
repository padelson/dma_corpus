-3-  ARTICLE II



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES



2.1 _ Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Pixelworks, Genesis,
Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of the capital stock of Genesis or
the capital stock of Merger Sub:



(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock of
Merger Sub, par value $0.001 per share, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Pixelworks-Owned Stock_. All
shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Genesis ("Genesis
Common Stock") that are owned by Genesis as treasury stock or by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Genesis and any shares of Genesis Common
Stock owned by Pixelworks, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Pixelworks immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no shares of Pixelworks or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Exchange Ratio for Genesis Common Stock_. Each share of Genesis
Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section
2.1(b) hereof) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted (subject to Section 2.2(c)) into the right to
receive 2.3366 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Pixelworks Common Stock ("Pixelworks Common Stock"),
upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Genesis Common
Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Genesis Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Genesis Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive Pixelworks Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Pixelworks Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2, without interest.



(d) _Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
to reflect appropriately the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Pixelworks Common Stock or Genesis Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
Pixelworks Common Stock or Genesis Common Stock occurring (or for which a
record date is established) on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.



(e) _Unvested Stock_. If any shares of Genesis Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with Genesis, then the
shares of Pixelworks Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Genesis Common Stock will also be unvested or subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares of Pixelworks Common Stock will accordingly be
marked with appropriate legends. Genesis shall not take or permit any action,
which would accelerate vesting of any unvested shares, or remove, modify or
amend any such risk of forfeiture or other condition, except to the
extent required by their terms as in effect on the date hereof. All
outstanding rights and obligations of Genesis in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with Genesis, including without limitation any
right to repurchase unvested shares of Genesis Common Stock or to exercise any
other right with respect to shares of Genesis Common Stock that are
restricted, shall be automatically assigned to Pixelworks in the Merger at
the Effective Time and shall thereafter become rights and obligations of
Pixelworks upon the same terms and conditions in effect  



 

-4-  immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the shares purchasable
pursuant to such rights and the purchase price payable per share shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect the Exchange Ratio. Genesis and Pixelworks
each shall take all reasonable steps necessary to cause the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.1(e) to occur. 

---|--- 


2.2 _ Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging
outstanding shares of Genesis Common Stock for Pixelworks Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger are as follows:



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Pixelworks shall make available to Mellon Investor
Services LLC or another bank or trust company designated by Pixelworks and
reasonably acceptable to Genesis (the "Exchange Agent"), as needed, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, (i)
the shares of Pixelworks Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Genesis Common Stock, (ii) cash in an
amount sufficient to make payments for fractional shares required pursuant to
Section 2.2(c), and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Genesis Common Stock (the "Certificates") may be
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d).



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or
Certificates whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the
right to receive shares of Pixelworks Common Stock, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c) hereof, and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d) hereof (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such
other provisions as Pixelworks may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Pixelworks
Common Stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares of Pixelworks Common
Stock, if any, and any dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Pixelworks, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Pixelworks Common Stock issuable in respect
thereof pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.1 (provided that in lieu of a
certificate representing such shares of Pixelworks Common Stock, such shares
may be issued in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate
is requested or is otherwise required by applicable law or regulation) plus
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and any dividends
or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Genesis Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of Genesis, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Pixelworks Common Stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d)
may be issued or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence acceptable to Pixelworks or any agent
designated by it that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Pixelworks Common Stock to be issued in
consideration therefor plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d)
as contemplated by this Section 2.2.



(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Pixelworks Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a stockholder of Pixelworks. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Genesis Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Pixelworks Common Stock (after taking into
account all Certificates delivered by such holder and the aggregate number of
shares of Genesis  



 

-5-  Common Stock represented thereby) shall, upon surrender of such holderÂ’s
Certificates, receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional part of a share of Pixelworks Common Stock multiplied
by the average of the last reported sales prices of shares of Pixelworks
Common Stock at the end of regular trading hours on the Nasdaq National
Market ("Nasdaq") during the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the
last trading day prior to the Effective Time.



(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Pixelworks Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of record
of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect
of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to the record holder of the whole shares of Pixelworks
Common Stock issued in exchange therefore, without interest, (i) the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Pixelworks Common
Stock, without interest, and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Pixelworks Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(c) above.



(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Genesis Common Stock_. All shares of
Pixelworks Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash or dividends or other
distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(d)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Genesis Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Genesis Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.



(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of
Pixelworks, Merger Sub, Genesis, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Genesis Common Stock or
Pixelworks Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to one year after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Pixelworks
Common Stock, and any cash payable to the holder of such Certificate or any
dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant
to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such shares of Pixelworks Common Stock or cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.



(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Pixelworks and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
or former holder of shares of Genesis Common Stock such amounts as it
reasonably determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or any other applicable legal
requirement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person to whom such amounts would have otherwise have been
delivered.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent may require the stockholder
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, to make and deliver an affidavit of that
fact and provide such other documentation and pay such fees, or post such
bonds, as is the customary practice of the Exchange Agent prior to delivering
the certificates representing the shares of Pixelworks Common Stock into
which the shares of Genesis Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate was converted pursuant to Section 2.1 and cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.2(c)  



 

-6-  and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d);
provided, however, that Pixelworks may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of
Pixelworks Common Stock and other distributions, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Pixelworks, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed;
providedfurther, that in no event shall Pixelworks be required to pay any fee
or post any bond referred to in this Section 2.2(h). 

---|--- 



2.3 _ Genesis Stock Plans_.



(a) At the Effective Time, Pixelworks shall assume GenesisÂ’s 1987 Stock
Option Plan (the "1987 Plan"), 1997 Paradise Stock Option Plan (the "Paradise
Plan"), 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Employee Plan"), 1997 Non-
Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Non-Employee Plan"), 2000 Non-Statutory Stock
Option Plan (the "2000 NSO Plan"), 2001 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the
"2001 NSO Plan") and 1997 Sage Second Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan
(the "Sage Plan," and together with the 1987 Plan, the Paradise Plan, the 1997
Employee Plan, the Non-Employee Plan, the 2000 NSO Plan and the 2001 NSO
Plan, the "Genesis Stock Plans"), and each outstanding option to purchase
Genesis Common Stock under any of the Genesis Stock Plans, whether vested or
unvested and whether exercisable or unexercisable (each an "Genesis Stock
Option"), shall be assumed by Pixelworks and shall be deemed to constitute an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Genesis Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, the same
number of shares of Pixelworks Common Stock as the holder of such Genesis
Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had
such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at a price per share (rounded
up to the nearest cent) equal to (y) the aggregate exercise price for the
shares of Genesis Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Genesis Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (z) the aggregate
number of shares of Pixelworks Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to
such Genesis Stock Option in accordance with the foregoing. Such Genesis Stock
Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 2.3). It is the intention of the
parties that the Genesis Stock Options assumed by Pixelworks qualify, to the
maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time, as incentive stock
options (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), to the extent the Genesis
Stock Options qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective
Time.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Pixelworks shall
deliver to the participants in the Genesis Stock Plans an appropriate notice
setting forth such participantsÂ’ rights with respect to the Genesis Stock
Options, as provided in this Section 2.3.



(c) Pixelworks shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Pixelworks Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Genesis Stock Options assumed in accordance with this
Section 2.3. Promptly after the Effective Time, Pixelworks shall file one or
more registration statements on Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect
to the shares of Pixelworks Common Stock subject to such Genesis
Stock Options (to the extent a Form S-8 is available for such options) and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such options remain outstanding.



(d) The rights of participants in the Genesis 1997 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "Genesis ESPP") with respect to any offering then underway under
the Genesis ESPP shall be determined by treating the last business day prior
to the Effective Time as the last day of such offering period and by making
such other pro rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period but otherwise treating such shortened offering period as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under the
Genesis ESPP. Outstanding rights to purchase shares of Genesis Common Stock
shall be exercised in accordance with Section 19(c) of the Genesis ESPP, and
each share of Genesis Common Stock purchased pursuant to such exercise shall
by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder  



 

-7-  thereof, be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of
Pixelworks Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1(c) hereof without
issuance of certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Genesis
Common Stock to participants under the Genesis ESPP. As of the Effective Time,
the Genesis ESPP shall be terminated. Prior to the Effective Time, Genesis
shall (i) provide Pixelworks with evidence that the Genesis ESPP has been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of GenesisÂ’s board of directors; the form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to prior review and
approval of Pixelworks (the approval of which shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and (ii) take such other reasonable actions (including, but not
limited to, if appropriate, amending the Genesis ESPP) that are necessary to
give effect to the transaction contemplated by this Section 2.3(d). In the
event that the Effective Time occurs on or after August 1, 2003, Pixelworks
shall take such actions as are necessary to provide to GenesisÂ’s employees who
become employees of Pixelworks (or a subsidiary of Pixelworks)
the opportunity to enroll in a special offering period under the Pixelworks
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Special Offering Period"), which shall
commence within ten (10) business days following the Effective Time; provided,
that such employees satisfy the eligibility requirements of the Pixelworks
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and that such participation will be subject to
the other terms and conditions of such Plan; and provided, further, that, with
respect to GenesisÂ’s non-U.S. employees who become employees of Pixelworks
(or a subsidiary of Pixelworks) shall also have the opportunity to participate
in the Special Offering Period and subsequent offering periods that commence
under the Pixelworks Employee Stock Purchase Plan so long as such
participation is not prohibited under applicable law, rule or regulation and
does not result in any material additional administrative cost to Pixelworks,
based on GenesisÂ’s historical costs and taking into account the size of
Pixelworks after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Special Offering Period shall consist of four "Purchase
Periods" (as defined under the Pixelworks Employee Stock Purchase Plan), the
first Purchase Period shall start on the first day of the Special Offering
Period and shall end on the last trading day immediately preceding the next
February 1 or August 1, whichever first occurs, and the following
three Purchase Periods shall each be six (6) months in duration coinciding
with the usual Purchase Period cycles under the Pixelworks Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (subject, in each case, to earlier termination as provided for
in the Pixelworks Employee Stock Purchase Plan). In all other respects,
participation in the Special Offering Period and the terms of the Special
Offering Period shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Pixelworks
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Pixelworks agrees to designate Genesis as a
subsidiary eligible to participate in the Pixelworks Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. 

---|--- 



(e) Genesis and Pixelworks shall take all requisite actions, including any
required amendments to the Genesis Stock Plans, Genesis Stock Options or the
Genesis ESPP so as to permit the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3
without the consent of the affected award holder.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GENESIS



Genesis hereby represents and warrants to Pixelworks and Merger Sub as
follows:



3.1 _ Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries_. Genesis is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and, except as set forth in
Section 3.1 of the letter delivered by Genesis to Pixelworks on the
date hereof (the "Genesis Disclosure Letter"), is in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted,
and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such

qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, which have
not had, and are not reasonably likely to have, an Genesis Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Genesis Material Adverse
Effect" means any change, effect, occurrence or state of facts (any such item,
an "Effect"), individually or when taken together with all other Effects that
have occurred prior to the date of determination of a Material Adverse Effect,
that is, or is reasonably expected to be, materially adverse to (i) the
business, assets, liabilities, capitalization, condition (financial or
other), or results of operations of Genesis and its Subsidiaries (as defined
in Section 3.4), taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Genesis to perform
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in
no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to
constitute an Genesis Material Adverse Effect: any Effect resulting from (A)
general economic conditions or conditions generally affecting any industry in
which Genesis operates, except to the extent that Genesis is materially
disproportionately affected thereby; (B) the outbreak or escalation of
hostilities or terrorist activities, either in the United States or abroad;
(C) the announcement or pendency of the Merger; (D) a change in the stock
price or trading volume of Genesis (or any failure of Genesis to meet
published revenue or earnings projections), in and of itself, provided, that
this clause (D) shall not exclude any underlying Effect which may have caused
such change in stock price or trading volume or failure to meet published
revenue or earnings projections; or (E) any litigation arising out of or
related to any alleged breach of fiduciary duty related to this Agreement or
the intellectual property litigation with Silicon Image, Inc. pending against
Genesis as of the date of this Agreement.



3.2 _ Charter Documents_. Genesis has delivered or made available to
Pixelworks complete and correct copies of its (i) Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws as amended to date (together, the "Genesis Charter Documents") and

documents, and Bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents. Such Genesis
Charter Documents and equivalent organizational documents of each of its
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect. Genesis is not in violation of any
of the provisions of the Genesis Charter Documents, and no Subsidiary of
Genesis is in violation of its equivalent organizational documents. 



3.3 _ Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of Genesis consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Genesis Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par

-9- (b) No shares of Genesis Common Stock held by an executive officer or
director of Genesis constitute restricted stock or are otherwise subject to a
repurchase or redemption right or right of first refusal in favor of Genesis.



(c) Section 3.3(c) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
and correct list, as of March 12, 2003, of all outstanding Genesis Stock
Options, indicating with respect to each such Genesis Stock Option the name
of the holder thereof, the Genesis Stock Plan under which it was granted, the
number of shares of Genesis Common Stock subject to such Genesis Stock Option,
the exercise price and the date of grant, vesting schedule and whether (and
to what extent) the vesting will be accelerated in any way by the Merger or by
termination of employment or change in position following consummation of the
Merger and the date on which the Genesis Stock Option expires. Except as set
forth on Section 3.3(c) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, since March 12,
2003, Genesis has not granted any additional Genesis Stock Options or
otherwise modified the terms of such Genesis Stock Options. Genesis has
provided or made available to Pixelworks complete and correct copies of all
Genesis Stock Plans and the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing
Genesis Stock Options.



(d) Other than as set forth in Sections 3.3(a)-(c) above, and except as set
forth in Section 3.3(d) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, there are no equity
securities, partnership interests or other similar ownership interests of any
class or series of capital stock of Genesis, or any securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for such equity securities, partnership
interests or other similar ownership interests issued, reserved for issuance
or outstanding. Except as set forth in Section 3.3(d) of the Genesis
Disclosure Letter, except for securities Genesis owns, directly or indirectly

Disclosure Letter, there are no options, warrants, equity securities,
partnership interests or other similar ownership interests, calls, rights
(including preemptive rights), commitments or agreements of any kind or

Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries is bound obligating Genesis or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or cause the
repurchase, redemption or acquisition, of any shares of capital stock of
Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating Genesis or any of its
Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of or enter into any
such option, warrant, equity security, partnership interest or other similar
ownership interest, call, right, commitment or agreement, except as set forth
in Section 3.3(d) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter.



(e) Except as set forth in Sections 3.3(a)-(d) above, (x) there is
no agreement, written or oral, between Genesis or any Affiliate of Genesis
and any holder of the securities of Genesis relating to the sale or transfer
(including agreements relating to rights of first refusal, co-sale rights or
"drag-along" rights), registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Securities Act"), or voting, of the capital stock of Genesis, and (y) there
is no rights agreement, "poison pill" anti-takeover plan or other agreement
or understanding to which Genesis is a party or by which it is bound with
respect to any equity security of any class of Genesis. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Affiliate" when used with respect to any party means any

not wholly-owned) and type of outstanding equity securities (as well as
securities exchangeable or exercisable for and convertible into equity
securities thereby) and a list of the holders thereof; and (iii) the
jurisdiction of organization. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Subsidiary" means, with respect to any party, any corporation,
partnership, trust, limited liability company or other non-corporate business

interests upon a liquidation or dissolution of such entity.



(b) Each Subsidiary of Genesis is a corporation, partnership, limited
liability corporation, limited liability partnership or other business
association or entity duly organized, validly existing and, if applicable, in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, has all
requisite corporate, partnership or other entity power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and, except as set forth
in Section 3.4(b) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties owned, operated or leased or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except for
such failures to be so organized, qualified or in good standing that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had, and are not reasonably likely
to have, an Genesis Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section
3.4(b) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock and other equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of
Genesis are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and, if applicable,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and all such shares and interests
owned, of record and beneficially, by Genesis or another of its Subsidiaries
are owned free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges,
agreements, limitations in GenesisÂ’s voting rights, charges or other
encumbrances of any nature. There are no outstanding or authorized options,
warrants, rights, agreements or commitments to which Genesis or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or which are binding on any of them providing for
the issuance, disposition or acquisition of any capital stock of any
Subsidiary of Genesis, except as set forth in Section 3.4(b) of the Genesis
Disclosure Letter. There are no outstanding stock appreciation, phantom stock
or similar rights with respect to any Subsidiary of Genesis. There are no
voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or understandings with respect to
the voting of any capital stock of any Subsidiary of Genesis.



(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.4(c) of the Genesis
Disclosure Letter, Genesis does not control directly or indirectly or have
any direct or indirect equity participation or similar interest in any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other business association or entity, which is not a Subsidiary of Genesis.
Except as set forth in Section 3.4(c) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, there
are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Genesis or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of any Subsidiary of Genesis or to provide funds to or make any material
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
Subsidiary of Genesis or any other entity, other than guarantees of
bank obligations of Subsidiaries of Genesis entered into in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and the standard practices of
other established businesses in the same industry (the "Ordinary Course
of Business").



 

-11- 3.5 _ Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.



(a) Genesis has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, and, subject only to the adoption of this Agreement
(the "Genesis Voting Proposal") by GenesisÂ’s stockholders under Delaware Law
(the "Genesis Stockholder Approval"), to perform its obligations hereunder and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Genesis Board, at a meeting duly
called and held, by the unanimous vote of all directors: (i) determined that
the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of Genesis and its
stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement in accordance with the provisions
of Delaware Law and the Genesis Charter Documents and the filing and
recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by Delaware Law; (iii)
approved the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv)
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the stockholders of Genesis for
their adoption and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Genesis
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Genesis have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Genesis, subject (in the case of the Merger
Agreement) only to the required receipt of the Genesis Stockholder Approval
and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by
Delaware Law. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by Genesis and, when duly and validly executed and delivered by each of
Pixelworks and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Genesis, enforceable against Genesis in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’
rights and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Genesis do not, and the
performance by Genesis of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not: (i) conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
provision of the Genesis Charter Documents or of the charter, Bylaws, or other
organizational document of any Subsidiary of Genesis; (ii) conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any material
benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under, constitute a change in
control under, require the payment of a penalty under or result in the
imposition of any mortgages, security interests, pledges, liens, charges or
encumbrances of any nature ("Liens") on GenesisÂ’s or any of its SubsidiariesÂ’
assets under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract or other agreement, instrument
or obligation (each, a "Contract") to which Genesis or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their properties or
assets may be bound, except with respect to those items set forth in Section
3.5(b) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter; or (iii) subject to obtaining the
Genesis Stockholder Approval and compliance with the requirements specified in
clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 3.5(c), conflict with or violate any
federal, state, local, municipal, foreign or other governmental permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, injunction, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation (each, a "Legal Requirement") applicable to
Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their properties or
assets, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 3.5(b)
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or losses which, individually or in
the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have an Genesis Material Adverse
Effect. Section 3.5(b) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter lists all Contracts to
which Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound under
which consents, waivers and approvals are required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
which, if individually or in the aggregate were not obtained, would result in
a material loss of benefits to Genesis, Pixelworks or the Surviving
Corporation as a result of the Merger.



(c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any court, arbitrational
tribunal, administrative agency or commission or other governmental or
regulatory authority, agency or instrumentality (a "Governmental Entity") is
required by or with respect  



 

-12-  to Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Genesis or the performance by Genesis of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for: (i) the pre-merger
notification requirements (the "HSR Approval") of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "HSR Act") and of the comparable laws
of any foreign jurisdiction reasonably determined by the parties to apply;

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations

approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as
may be required under applicable state securities laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and
the comparable laws of any foreign country; (vi) the rules and regulations of
Nasdaq; and (vii) such other consents, authorizations, orders, filings,
approvals and registrations which, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably
likely to have an Genesis Material Adverse Effect.

-13- (d) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of Genesis for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the registration statement on Form S-4 to be

Securities Act (the "Registration Statement"), or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Genesis for inclusion in any filing pursuant to Rule 165 and Rule
425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (each, a
"Regulation M-A Filing"), shall not at the time the Registration Statement or
such Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, at any time it is amended
or supplemented, or at the time the Registration Statement is declared
effective by the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein not misleading. The information to be supplied

which it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus not false or
misleading, or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Genesis Meeting or the Pixelworks Meeting which has become
false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any fact or

Genesis or should occur which should be set forth in an amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, Genesis shall promptly inform Pixelworks of such fact
or event.

SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and except for normal and
recurring liabilities incurred since the date of the Genesis Balance Sheet in
the Ordinary Course of Business, Genesis and its Subsidiaries do not have any
liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) (whether or not
required to be reflected in financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles), and whether due or to become due,
which individually or in the aggregate are reasonably likely to have an
Genesis Material Adverse Effect.

Genesis SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and except as
set forth in Section 3.8 of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, since the date of
the Genesis Balance Sheet, Genesis and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business and, since such
date, there has not been: (i) any change, event, circumstance, development
or effect that individually or in the aggregate has had, or is reasonably
likely to have, an Genesis Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) any other action
or event that would have required the consent of Pixelworks pursuant to

payment of any material Tax nor is there any material Tax deficiency
outstanding, proposed or assessed against Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries,
nor has Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries executed any unexpired waiver or
extension of any statute of limitations on or extending the period for the
assessment or collection of any Tax, nor has any such waiver or extension

Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Genesis
Disclosure Letter, no property subject to an Genesis Lease is occupied by a
third party other than Genesis, and no third party has a right to occupy such
property other than Genesis. Genesis has provided or made available to

to any Contract or other legal obligation to which Genesis or any Subsidiary
of Genesis is a party or otherwise bound, will not result in: (i) except with
respect to those items listed in Section 3.11(b)(i) of the Genesis Disclosure
Letter, Pixelworks or any Subsidiary of Pixelworks (other than Genesis and its

to any material Intellectual Property of Pixelworks or any Subsidiary of
Pixelworks); or (iii) except with respect to those items listed in Section
3.11(b)(iii) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, the termination or breach of
any contract to which Genesis or any Subsidiary of Genesis is a party, which
termination or breach would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse

full force and effect except to the extent it has previously expired in

its Subsidiaries, nor to GenesisÂ’s knowledge, any other party to an Genesis
Contract is in material breach, violation or default under, and neither
Genesis nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has

such required Environmental Permits and all such Environmental Permits are
valid and in full force and effect; and (iii) have conducted all Hazardous
Material Activities relating to their business in compliance in all material
respects with all Environmental Laws, other than, as to each of (i), (ii), and
(iii), such as would not have an Genesis Material Adverse Effect. No
action, proceeding, revocation proceeding, amendment procedure, writ,
injunction or claim is pending, or to the knowledge of Genesis, threatened,
concerning or relating to any Environmental Permit or any Hazardous Materials
Activity of Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries relating to its business, or
any Genesis Business Facility. As of the date hereof, except in compliance
with Environmental Laws and in a manner that could not reasonably be expected
to subject Genesis or any Subsidiary to material liability, to the knowledge
of Genesis, no Hazardous Materials are present in, on or under any Genesis
Business Facility currently owned, leased, operated or occupied by Genesis or
any Subsidiary of Genesis or were present on any other Genesis Business
Facility at the time it ceased to be owned, leased, operated or occupied by
Genesis or any Subsidiary of Genesis. For the purposes of this Section 3.14,
"GenesisBusiness Facility" means any property, including the land, the
improvements thereon, the groundwater thereunder and the surface water
thereon, that is or at any time has been owned, operated, occupied,
controlled, or leased by Genesis or any Subsidiary of Genesis in connection
with the operation of its business. "Environmental Laws" means all federal,
state, local and foreign laws and regulations which prohibit, regulate or
control Hazardous Materials or any Hazardous Materials Activity or which
relate to pollution of the environment (including ambient air, surface water,
ground water, land surface or subsurface strata) or the protection of human
health and worker safety. "Hazardous Materials" means any material, chemical,
or substance that is prohibited or regulated by any Governmental Entity to be
toxic, radioactive, hazardous or otherwise a danger to health, reproduction or
the environment, excluding, however, Hazardous Materials contained in products
typically used for office and janitorial purposes properly and safely
maintained in accordance with Environmental Laws. "Hazardous Materials

manufacture, removal, remediation, release, exposure of others to, sale, or
distribution of any Hazardous Material or any product containing a Hazardous
Material.

disclosure agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive
covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to
be employed by Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the
business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by Genesis or any of
its Subsidiaries or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of
others, the consequences of which, individually or in the aggregate, are

knowledge of Genesis, no key employee or group of employees has any plans to
terminate employment with Genesis or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Neither Genesis nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise
bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or

is seeking to compel it to bargain with any labor union or labor organization
that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to have an
Genesis Material Adverse Effect, nor is there pending or, to the knowledge of
Genesis, threatened, any labor strike, dispute, walkout, work stoppage, slow-
down or lockout involving Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries.

Letter, each Genesis Employee Plan has been maintained and administered in all
material respects in material compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations

is pending or, to the knowledge of Genesis, is threatened, against or with
respect to any such Genesis Employee Plan. There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Genesis, threatened by the IRS or

pronouncements in which to apply for or receive such letter and to make any
amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination and (ii) incorporates

as set forth in Section 3.16(b) of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, Genesis does
not have any plan or commitment to establish any new Genesis Employee Plan, to
modify any Genesis Employee Plan (except to the extent required by law or to
conform any such Genesis Employee Plan to the requirements of any applicable
law (including any law governing the tax-favored status of any Genesis
Employee Plan), in each case as previously disclosed to Pixelworks in writing,
or as required by this Agreement), or to enter into any new Genesis Employee
Plan. Each Genesis Employee Plan or Genesis Employment Agreement can be
amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms, without material liability to Pixelworks, Genesis
or any of its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses
and expenses for benefits properly accrued but not yet paid).

(c) Neither Genesis, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Genesis ERISA
Affiliate has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, and at no time has Genesis, any of its Subsidiaries
or any Genesis ERISA Affiliate contributed to or been requested to contribute
to any "Multiemployer Plan," and neither Genesis, any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any Genesis ERISA Affiliate has at any time ever maintained, established,
sponsored, participated in, or contributed to any Multiemployer Plan, or to
any plan described in Section 413 of the Code. Neither Genesis, any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of Genesis or any of
its Subsidiaries is subject to any material liability or penalty under
Sections 4975 through 4980B of the Code or Title I of ERISA. No material
"Prohibited Transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or
Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of
ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Genesis Employee Plan.

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"). None of the
Genesis Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree
welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable law, and

contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree benefits
to any Genesis Employee or other person, except to the extent required by
statute.



(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.16(e) of the Genesis Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
performance of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events): (i) constitute an
event under any Genesis Employee Plan, Genesis Employment Agreement, trust,
loan or other agreement that will or may result in any material payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation
to fund benefits with respect to any Genesis Employee; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Genesis Employee Plan or
Genesis Employment Agreement; or (iii) result in any payment or benefit which

-20- (f) _Genesis International Employee Plan_. Each Genesis International
Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered in material
compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed
by any all statutory or regulatory laws that are applicable to such Genesis
International Employee Plan. No Genesis International Employee Plan has
material unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be
offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by law, no condition
exists that would prevent Genesis, any Subsidiary of Genesis, Pixelworks or
any Subsidiary of Pixelworks (as of the Effective Time), from terminating or
amending any Genesis International Employee Plan at any time for any reason
without material liability to Genesis, any of its Subsidiaries, Pixelworks or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than ordinary administration expenses or
routine claims for benefits). For purposes of this Agreement, "Genesis
International Employee Plan" shall mean each Genesis Plan or Genesis
Employment Agreement that has been adopted or maintained by Genesis or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether formally or informally or with respect to which
Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries will or may have any liability for the
benefit of any Genesis Employee or any employee of its Subsidiaries who
perform services outside the United States.



3.17 _ Compliance With Laws_. Neither Genesis nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Legal

note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Genesis or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any conflicts,
defaults or violations that (individually or in the aggregate) would not have
or be reasonably expected to have an Genesis Material Adverse Effect. Except
as set forth in Section 3.17 of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, to the
knowledge of Genesis, no investigation or review by any governmental or
regulatory body or authority is pending or threatened against Genesis or its
Subsidiaries, nor has any governmental or regulatory body or authority
indicated in writing to Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries an intention to
conduct the same, other than, in each such case, those the outcome of which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any current business
practice of Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of material
property by Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of business by
Genesis or any of its Subsidiaries.



3.18 _ Permits_. Genesis and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental
authorities which are material to operation of the business of Genesis and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the "Genesis Permits").
Genesis and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with
the terms of the Genesis Permits, except where such failure to comply would
not have or be reasonably expected to have an Genesis Material Adverse
Effect.



3.19 _ Absence of Liens and Encumbrances_. Except as set forth in
Section 3.19 of the Genesis Disclosure Letter, Genesis and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties, including the Genesis Leases, valid leasehold interests in, all

business, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances except as reflected on

not be material to Genesis.

insurance policies (the "Genesis Insurance Policies") with reputable insurance
carriers against all risks of a character as are usually insured against, and
in such coverage amounts as are usually maintained, by similarly situated
companies in the same or similar businesses. Each Genesis Insurance Policy is
in full force and effect.



3.21 _ No Existing Discussions_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Genesis nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged, directly or
indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with any other party with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.1(e)).



 

-21- 3.22 _ Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The financial advisor of Genesis,
Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, has delivered to Genesis an opinion dated the
date of this Agreement to the effect, as of such date, that the Exchange
Ratio is fair to the holders of Genesis Common Stock from a financial point of
view.



3.23 _ State Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of Genesis has
approved this Agreement and the Pixelworks Voting Agreements and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such approval
is sufficient to render inapplicable to the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the restrictions contained in Section 203 of
the Delaware Law to the extent, if any, such restrictions would otherwise
be applicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the Pixelworks Voting
Agreements and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Pixelworks Voting Agreements. No other state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation applies to or purports to apply to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Pixelworks Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

or other firm or person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action,
agreement or commitment of Genesis or any of its Affiliates, to any brokerÂ’s,

with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except Dresdner
Kleinwort Wasserstein, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Genesis.
Genesis has delivered to Pixelworks a complete and correct copy of all
agreements pursuant to which Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is entitled to any
fees and expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

amended (in the form provided to Pixelworks) the Preferred Stock Rights

Pixelworks, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall become an
"Acquiring Person," and no "Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as such
terms are defined in the Genesis Rights Agreement) will occur, as a result of
the approval, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Genesis Voting
Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The Genesis Rights Agreement and the outstanding rights
thereunder (the "Genesis Rights") shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, without any
consideration being payable with respect to the outstanding Genesis Rights
thereunder.



3.26 _ Vote Required_. The affirmative vote by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Genesis Common Stock entitled to vote with
respect to the Merger is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of GenesisÂ’s capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of Genesis having the right to vote (or convertible into,
or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which stockholders of Genesis may vote.

not had, and are not reasonably likely to have a Pixelworks Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Pixelworks Material Adverse

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of Pixelworks to perform
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
in no event shall any of the following, alone or in combination, be deemed to

Effect. Section 4.5(b) of the Pixelworks Disclosure Letter lists all
Contracts to which Pixelworks or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or
otherwise bound under which consents, waivers and approvals are required to be
obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which, if individually or in the aggregate were not obtained, would

relating to any Environmental Permit or any Hazardous Materials Activity of
Pixelworks or any Subsidiary relating to its business, or any Pixelworks

of Pixelworks, no Hazardous Materials are present in, on or under
any Pixelworks Business Facility currently owned, leased, operated or
occupied by Pixelworks or any Subsidiary of Pixelworks or were present on any

(ii) incorporates or has been amended to incorporate all provisions required
to comply with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation enacted
before 2002. Pixelworks does not have any plan or commitment to establish any
new Pixelworks Employee Plan, to modify any Pixelworks Employee Plan (except
to the extent required by law or to conform any such Pixelworks Employee Plan
to the requirements of any applicable law (including any law governing the
tax-favored status of any Pixelworks Employee Plan) in each case as
previously disclosed to Pixelworks in writing, or as required by this
Agreement), or to enter into any new Pixelworks Employee Plan. Each Pixelworks
Employee Plan or Pixelworks Employment Agreement can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms, without material liability to Genesis, Pixelworks or any of its ERISA
Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses and expenses
for benefits properly accrued but not yet paid).



(c) Neither Pixelworks, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Pixelworks ERISA
Affiliates has at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code and at no time has Pixelworks, any of its Subsidiaries
or any Pixelworks ERISA Affiliate contributed to or been requested to
contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, and neither Pixelworks, any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any Pixelworks ERISA Affiliate has at any time ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed to any
Multiemployer Plan, or to any plan described in Section 413 of the Code.
Neither Pixelworks, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any officer or director of
Pixelworks or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material liability or
penalty under Sections 4975 through 4980B of the Code or Title I of ERISA. No
material Prohibited Transaction and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of
ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Pixelworks Employee Plan.



(d) Neither Pixelworks, any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Pixelworks ERISA
Affiliates has, prior to the Effective Time and in any material respect,
violated any of the health continuation requirements of COBRA. None of the
Pixelworks Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other
retiree welfare benefits to any person except as required by applicable law,
and neither Pixelworks nor any of its Subsidiaries has represented, promised
or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to provide such retiree
benefits to any Pixelworks Employee, or other person, except to the extent
required by statute.



(e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the
performance of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or upon
the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events): (i) constitute an
event under any Pixelworks Employee Plan, Pixelworks Employment Agreement,
trust, loan or other agreement that will or may result in any material payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation  



 

-33-  to fund benefits with respect to any Pixelworks Employee; (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Pixelworks Employee Plan or
Pixelworks Employment Agreement, except as set forth under Section 4.16(e) of
the Pixelworks Disclosure Letter; or (iii) result in any payment or benefit
which will or may be made by Pixelworks or any Subsidiaries with respect
to any Pixelworks Employee which will or may be characterized as an Excess
Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code.



(f) _Pixelworks International Employee Plan_. Each Pixelworks
International Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered
in material compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory laws that are applicable to
such Pixelworks International Employee Plan. No Pixelworks International
Employee Plan has material unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective
Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by
law, no condition exists that would prevent Pixelworks or any Subsidiary of
Pixelworks from terminating or amending any "Pixelworks International Employee
Plan" at any time for any reason without material liability to Pixelworks or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than ordinary administration expenses or
routine claims for benefits). For purposes of this Agreement, Pixelworks
International Employee Plan shall mean each Pixelworks Plan or Pixelworks
Employment Agreement that has been adopted or maintained by Pixelworks or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether formally or informally or with respect to which
Pixelworks or any of its Subsidiaries will or may have any liability for the
benefit of any Pixelworks Employee or any employee of its Subsidiaries who
perform services outside the United States.



 4.17 _Compliance With Laws_. Neither Pixelworks nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Legal
Requirement applicable to Pixelworks or any of its Subsidiaries or by which
its or any of their respective properties is bound or affected or (ii) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Pixelworks or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Pixelworks or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties is bound or affected, except for any
conflicts, defaults or violations that (individually or in the aggregate)
would not have or be reasonably expected to have a Pixelworks Material
Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Pixelworks, no investigation or review by
any governmental or regulatory body or authority is pending or threatened
against Pixelworks or its Subsidiaries, nor has any governmental or
regulatory body or authority indicated in writing to Pixelworks or any of its
Subsidiaries an intention to conduct the same, other than, in each such case,
those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially
impairing any current business practice of Pixelworks or any of its
Subsidiaries, any acquisition of material property by Pixelworks or any of
its Subsidiaries or the conduct of business by Pixelworks or any of its
Subsidiaries.



 4.18 _Permits_. Pixelworks and its Subsidiaries hold all permits,
licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from governmental
authorities which are material to operation of the business of Pixelworks and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (collectively, the "Pixelworks Permits").
Pixelworks and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects
with the terms of the Pixelworks Permits, except where such failure to comply
would not have or be reasonably expected to have a Pixelworks Material Adverse
Effect.



 4.19 _Absence of Liens and Encumbrances_. Pixelworks and each of its
Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties, including the Pixelworks Leases, valid leasehold interests in,
all of its tangible properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used in
its business, free and clear of any liens or encumbrances except as reflected
on the Pixelworks Balance Sheet and except for liens for taxes not yet due
and payable and such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which
would not be material to Pixelworks.



 

-34-  4.20 _Insurance_. Each of Pixelworks and its Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies (the "Pixelworks Insurance Policies") with reputable
insurance carriers against all risks of a character as are usually insured
against, and in such coverage amounts as are usually maintained, by similarly
situated companies in the same or similar businesses. Each Pixelworks
Insurance Policy is in full force and effect. 



 4.21 _No Existing Discussions_. As of the date of this Agreement,
neither Pixelworks nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged, directly or
indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with any other party with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal.



 4.22 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The financial advisor of
Pixelworks, Salomon Smith Barney, has delivered to Pixelworks an opinion dated
the date of this Agreement to the effect, as of such date, that the Exchange
Ratio is fair to Pixelworks from a financial point of view.



 4.23 _State Takeover Statutes_. The Board of Directors of Pixelworks
has approved this Agreement and the Genesis Voting Agreements and the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and such approval
is sufficient to render inapplicable to the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the restrictions contained in Section 60.835
of the Oregon Business Corporation Act to the extent, if any, such
restrictions would otherwise be applicable to the Merger, this Agreement and
the Genesis Voting Agreements and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Genesis Voting Agreements. No other state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation applies to or purports to apply to the
Merger, this Agreement, the Genesis Voting Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.



 4.24 _Brokers_. No agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other firm or person is or shall be entitled, as a result of any action,
agreement or commitment of Pixelworks or any of its Affiliates, to any
brokerÂ’s, finderÂ’s, financial advisorÂ’s or other similar fee or commission in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
Salomon Smith Barney, whose fees and expenses shall be paid by Pixelworks.
Pixelworks has delivered to Genesis a complete and correct copy of all
agreements pursuant to which Salomon Smith Barney is entitled to any fees and
expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



 4.25 _Operations of Merger Sub_. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has
engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only
as contemplated by this Agreement.



 4.26 _Vote Required_. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Pixelworks Common Stock present or represented by
proxy and voting at the Pixelworks Meeting at which a quorum is present is
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of PixelworksÂ’s capital
stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
Pixelworks having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of
Pixelworks may vote.

Pixelworks, the approval of the issuance of the Pixelworks Common Stock in
the Merger at the Pixelworks Meeting (in each case, the "Specified Time"),
Genesis or Pixelworks may, so long as there has been no breach of this Section
6.1(a), in response to an Acquisition Proposal received by it and otherwise
in compliance with its obligations under Section 6.1(b): (x) request
clarifications from, or furnish information to (but not enter into discussions
with), any Person which makes an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal if (A) such action is taken subject to a confidentiality agreement
containing customary terms and conditions no less restrictive than those in
the Confidentiality Agreement with the party receiving the Acquisition
Proposal; (B) such action is taken solely for the purpose of obtaining
information reasonably necessary to ascertain whether such Acquisition
Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal (as

consultation with outside legal counsel and independent nationally recognized

any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.1 by any

respective Affiliates (other than any such Person who is an Affiliate or
employee of Genesis or Pixelworks, as the case may be), whether or not such
Person is purporting to act on behalf of Genesis or Pixelworks, as the case
may be, or their respective Affiliates, shall constitute a breach by Genesis
or Pixelworks, as the case may be, of this Section 6.1. Genesis and
Pixelworks shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, the provisions of any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement
entered into by it or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates

Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its securityholders a
position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal; provided that the content of any such disclosure thereunder shall

"Acquisition Proposal" means, with respect to any party, any offer or proposal
(other than an offer or proposal by Pixelworks) relating to any transaction
or series of related transactions other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement involving: (A) any acquisition or purchase by any person or
"Group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent (15%) interest in the
total outstanding voting securities of Genesis, Pixelworks or any of their
Subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any person or Group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the total outstanding voting securities of Genesis, Pixelworks or any
of their Subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business combination
or similar transaction involving Genesis or Pixelworks pursuant to which the
securityholders of such party immediately preceding such transaction hold less

resulting entity of such transaction, (B) any sale, lease (other than in the

indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation

and as a result of which the stockholders of such party immediately preceding

-40-  of Directors of such party has in good faith concluded (after consultation

advisors), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the Person making the offer, to
be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to such partyÂ’s

regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs that is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy

stockholders proxies in favor of the Pixelworks Voting Proposal and shall
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
the stockholders of Pixelworks required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock
Market, Inc. to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, after consultation with Genesis,
Pixelworks may adjourn or postpone the Pixelworks Meeting to the extent
necessary (i) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to PixelworksÂ’s stockholders, (ii) to
enable Pixelworks to solicit additional votes in favor of the Pixelworks

this Section 6.5 for the purpose of voting upon the Genesis Voting Proposal
and the Pixelworks Voting Proposal, respectively, and shall submit the Genesis
 



 

-42-  Voting Proposal and the Pixelworks Voting Proposal, respectively, to their
respective stockholders for the purpose of acting upon such proposal whether
or not (i) the Genesis Board or the Pixelworks Board, as the case may be, at
any time subsequent to the date hereof determines in the manner permitted by
Section 6.5(d) that this Agreement is no longer advisable or recommends
that the stockholders of Genesis or Pixelworks, as the case may be, reject
it, or (ii) any actual, potential or purported Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal has been commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to
Genesis or Pixelworks, as the case may be. 

---|--- 



(d) Notwithstanding this Section 6.5, the Pixelworks Board or the Genesis
Board, as applicable (the "Withdrawing Party," and the other party being the
"Non-Withdrawing Party") may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not
result from a breach by the Withdrawing Party, as the case may be, of Section
6.1, withdraw or modify its recommendation with respect to the Pixelworks
Voting Proposal or the Genesis Voting Proposal, as the case may be, or
recommend or declare advisable any Superior Proposal (such withdrawal or
modification, a "Change of Recommendation"), to the extent required by its
fiduciary obligations, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Withdrawing Party, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
independent nationally recognized financial advisors, but only at a time that
is prior to the Specified Time and is after the fifth (5th) business day
following receipt by the Non-Withdrawing Party of written notice advising it
that the Withdrawing Party desires to make a Change of Recommendation due to
the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such
Superior Proposal; provided, that, in the event a Withdrawing Party delivers
such Change of Recommendation notice and the Non-Withdrawing Party proposes to
the Withdrawing Party modifications to the terms of the Merger or this
Agreement (the "Modified Terms") during the three (3) business day period
following receipt by the Non-Withdrawing Party of the Change of Recommendation
notice, the Withdrawing Party shall not be entitled to effect a Change of
Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the Withdrawing Party
reasonably determines in good faith, after consideration of the Modified Terms
and after consultation with outside legal counsel and independent nationally
recognized financial advisors, that it is necessary to effect a Change of
Recommendation in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law. Nothing in this Section 6.5(d) shall be deemed to affect any obligation
of Pixelworks or Genesis under this Agreement or limit PixelworksÂ’s or
GenesisÂ’s obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Pixelworks
Meeting or the Genesis Meeting, respectively, regardless of whether the
Pixelworks Board or the Genesis Board, as the case may be, has withdrawn or
modified its recommendation. In the event of a withdrawal or modification of
its recommendation with respect to the Genesis Voting Proposal or the
Pixelworks Voting Proposal, as the case may be, the Withdrawing Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts, if so requested by the Non-Withdrawing Party,
to promptly furnish or cause to be furnished (in such formats, including
electronic formats, as the Non-Withdrawing Party or its agents, advisors or
attorneys may reasonably request) to the Non-Withdrawing Party and its agents,
advisors and attorneys, at the expense of the Non-Withdrawing Party, the most
current, accurate and complete stockholder lists of the Withdrawing
Party, including non-objecting beneficial owner lists, as may be requested by
the Non-Withdrawing Party or its agents, advisors or attorneys from time to
time so the Non-Withdrawing Party can solicit proxies from the Withdrawing
PartyÂ’s stockholders. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Board of
Directors of Genesis or Pixelworks from complying with its duty of candor
under Delaware law or Oregon law, if any.

before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review, comment
upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree on any

press release announcing the signing of this Agreement.



 6.8 _Section 368(a) Reorganization and Certain Conditions_. None of
Pixelworks, Merger Sub or Genesis shall, and they shall not permit any of
their respective Subsidiaries to, take any action that would be reasonably
expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or the conditions set forth in Sections
7.2(c) and 7.3(c) hereof to fail to be satisfied. The parties hereto hereby
adopt this Agreement as a plan of reorganization.

sets forth a list of those Persons who are, in GenesisÂ’s reasonable judgment,
"affiliates" of Genesis within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145 Affiliates"). Genesis shall notify Pixelworks in
writing of any change in the identity of its Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the
Closing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any Person who
currently is or becomes a Rule 145 Affiliate following the date of this
Agreement to enter into an Affiliate Agreement prior to the Closing.
Pixelworks shall be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates
Common Stock evidencing any Pixelworks Common Stock to be received by Rule 145
Affiliates of Genesis in the Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in

settlement of any stockholder litigation relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not settle any such
litigation without the other partyÂ’s prior written consent, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.



 6.12 _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Pixelworks will, and will cause the

obligations of Genesis pursuant to any indemnification agreements between
Genesis and its directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time and any indemnification provisions under the Genesis
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof (the
"Indemnified Parties"). The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Genesis Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by law.



(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Pixelworks will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directorsÂ’ and
officersÂ’ liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered
by GenesisÂ’s directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance policy on terms
comparable, if available, to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of Genesis; _provided_ , _however_ , that after that date which is
two (2) years after the Effective Time, in no event will Pixelworks or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such
coverage in excess of one hundred and seventy five percent (175%) of the
greater of (x) the annual premium paid by Genesis for the year immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (y) the annual premium paid by Pixelworks for
the first year following the Effective Time or (z) the annual premium paid by
Pixelworks for the second year following the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, if the annual premiums for such insurance exceed such
amount, Pixelworks shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available not exceeding such amount.



(c) If Pixelworks, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Pixelworks or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.



 

-45- (d) This Section 6.12 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Pixelworks and the
Surviving Corporation and their successors and assigns.



 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Pixelworks shall give prompt
notice to Genesis, and Genesis shall give prompt notice to Pixelworks, of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to
occur would be reasonably likely to cause (i) (A) any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to
materiality to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (B) any other
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (ii) any
material failure of Pixelworks and Merger Sub or Genesis, as the case may be,
or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.13 will not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such partyÂ’s obligation to consummate the Merger.



 6.14 _Board of Directors of Pixelworks_. The Pixelworks Board will take
all actions necessary to cause the Pixelworks Board, immediately after the
Effective Time, to consist of nine (9) persons, four (4) of whom shall have

the Effective Time but within twelve (12) months of the Effective Time, the
Pixelworks Chairman resigns, declines or is unable to continue to serve as a
director, or as the Pixelworks Chairman, a majority of the remaining Genesis
Board Designees then in office shall select a replacement as Chairman, which
director shall be reasonably acceptable to a majority of the Pixelworks Board
Designees then in office; _provided_ , _that_ , nothing in this sentence shall

serve as a director, a majority of the remaining Pixelworks Board Designees
then in office shall select a replacement for such Pixelworks Board Designee,
which person shall be reasonably acceptable to a majority of the Genesis Board

of the remaining Genesis Board Designees then in office shall select a
replacement for such Genesis Board Designee, which person shall be reasonably
acceptable to a majority of the Pixelworks Board Designees then in office. In
addition to the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Pixelworks shall take
reasonable actions to ensure that all employees of Genesis who continue
employment with Pixelworks or a subsidiary of Pixelworks following the
Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") and their eligible dependents continue
participation in the same Genesis health and welfare plans and arrangements in
effect prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pixelworks
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, terminate any such benefit plans and
arrangements; provided, however, that, all Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents as the case may be for participation in such plans) are
provided with equivalent levels of health and welfare benefits as those
provided to similarly situated eligible employees of Pixelworks. Following the
Effective Time, Pixelworks will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize the prior service with Genesis or its Subsidiaries (or any
predecessor company) of each of the Continuing Employees in connection with
all employee benefit plans of Pixelworks or its Subsidiaries in which
employees of Pixelworks comparably situated to the Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits. From and after the Effective
Time, Pixelworks will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) cause
any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under any group health plans of Pixelworks or its affiliates to be waived with
respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents and (ii) give
each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made.



(b) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time,
Genesis and its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and
all plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless
Pixelworks provides advance written notice to Genesis that such 401(k) plan(s)
shall not be terminated). Unless Pixelworks provides such written notice to
Genesis no later than three (3) business days prior to the Effective
Time, Genesis shall provide Pixelworks with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s)
have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions of GenesisÂ’s board of directors. The
form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and
approval by Pixelworks, the approval of which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Genesis also shall take such other actions in furtherance of
terminating such 401(k) plan(s) as Pixelworks may reasonably require. In the
event such 401(k) plans are terminated pursuant to this subsection 6.18(b),
Pixelworks shall permit participants in such terminated plans the opportunity
to rollover their account balances (and any outstanding loans) in such
terminated plan to the plan of Pixelworks that is intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement in which similarly situated employees of Pixelworks
participate.



(c) Following the Effective Time, Pixelworks or the Surviving Corporation
shall provide to Continuing Employees an employer matching contribution and/or
employer contribution, as the case may be, at a level not less than is
currently provided by Genesis to employees who are participants in
GenesisÂ’s 401(k) Plan established for the benefit of GenesisÂ’s employees
providing services in the United States and its Retirement Savings Plan
established for the benefit of GenesisÂ’s employees providing services in
Canada.



(d) Following the Effective Time, Pixelworks or the Surviving Corporation
shall permit Continuing Employees to participate in any corporate bonus
program or similar arrangement established by Pixelworks for the benefit of
its similarly situated employees. 



(e) Following the Effective Time, Pixelworks or the Surviving Corporation
shall establish an employee stock purchase loan program similar (but in no
event providing loans for less than the amount  



 

-48-  currently provided for under such program) to GenesisÂ’s 2001 Employee Stock
Purchase Loan Plan; _provided_ , _however_ ;  _that_ (i) the terms of any
such program and the implementation of the program shall be subject to
compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, (ii)
Pixelworks shall have reasonably determined that such a program will
not disqualify the Pixelworks Employee Stock Purchase Plan from being an
"employee stock purchase plan" as defined under Section 423 of the Code, (iii)
no loan shall be extended under such program in violation of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and any outstanding loan under such program shall be repaid
in full if any person is or is to become an "executive officer" of Pixelworks
(within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), (iv)
any outstanding loan under such program shall become due and payable in full
upon a termination of employment, (v) any loan under such program shall be
secured by any stock purchased with the proceeds of such loan and shall be a
full recourse obligation, and (vi) Pixelworks may provide that any loan under
such program shall bear interest at the lowest rate necessary to satisfy
applicable legal and regulatory requirements so as to avoid the imputation of
interest under the Code.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of Genesis
and Pixelworks agrees that each of them shall take such actions prior to the
Effective Time such that the Genesis Stock Options and the Pixelworks Stock
Options, as the case may be, held by members of the Genesis Board who are not
Genesis Board Designees, or members of the Pixelworks Board who are not
Pixelworks Board Designees, shall (i) fully vest as of the Effective Time and
(ii) remain exercisable for a period of two (2) years following the Effective
Time.

securities with respect to Pixelworks Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to Genesis to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.



 6.20 _Charter Documents_. Pixelworks agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to effect the amendment of the Pixelworks Charter Documents to
implement the provisions in Sections 6.14, 6.15(a) and 6.16 as of the
Effective Time, including amending the Bylaws of Pixelworks to be in
substantially the form attached as Appendix 6.20A to the Pixelworks Disclosure

9.5 _ Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.



9.6 _ Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner. 



9.7 _ Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered by facsimile transmission.



9.8 _ Interpretation; Definitions_.

by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may
require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and
pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"

venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability company or

9.9 _ Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. Except for those provisions
dealing with the effect of the Merger which shall be governed by Delaware Law
or Oregon law, as applicable, this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of
Delaware. Each of the parties to this Agreement irrevocably agrees that any
legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or for  



 

-58-  recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by any
other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined
in the Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware, and each party
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each party hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to lawfully serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts and (d) any right to a trial by jury.



9.10 _ Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law
or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.



9.11 _ Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PIXELWORKS, MERGER SUB AND GENESIS
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF PIXELWORKS, MERGER SUB OR GENESIS IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
