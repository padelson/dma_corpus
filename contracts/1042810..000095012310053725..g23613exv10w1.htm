CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS 

   

 3.1 _Working Capital Adjustment_. 

    

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, LIH shall, or shall cause the Company to, in good faith prepare an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), which for purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the balance sheet of the Company as of 11:59PM on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied by the Company and following the policies, procedures, principles and methods employed in preparing the audited balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2009 included in the Company Financial Statements and shall set forth a calculation of the Working Capital reflected thereon calculated in the manner set forth on _Schedule 3.1_. Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, LIH shall deliver to Equity One the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, including the calculation of Working Capital, together with worksheets and data that support the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and any other information that Equity One may reasonably request in order to verify the amounts reflected on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, including the calculation of Working Capital. Not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Equity One shall provide LIH with any good faith objections to the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of Working Capital in writing, together with such documentation as may reasonably support Equity Ones good faith objections. After considering Equity Ones objections, LIH may make such revisions to the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet as it believes are reasonably acceptable and deliver a revised Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, including the 

   ##### 

  

   

calculation of Working Capital, which shall be the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet for all purposes of clause (b) below. 

   

 (b) _Pre-Closing Adjustments_. 

   

 (i) To the extent that the Working Capital set forth on the final Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Estimated Working Capital Amount_ ") exceeds the Working Capital Threshold (such excess, if any, the " _Estimated Working Capital Surplus_ "), then, at LIHs election, either: 

   

 (A) LIH shall cause the Company to distribute some or all of the amount of such Estimated Working Capital Surplus as a dividend to LIH immediately prior to Closing; and/or 

   

 (B) the number of the LIH LLC Shares to be issued to LIH pursuant to  _Sections 2.3_ and _2.5(c)(ii)_ above shall be increased by that number (rounded to the nearest whole number) which is the quotient of the Estimated Working Capital Surplus (less the amount of any distribution made pursuant to clause (A) above) divided by the Exchange Price ( _provided_ , that to the extent such Estimated Working Capital Surplus exceeds $2,500,000, such excess amount shall be divided by the EQY VWAP Price instead of the Exchange Price), and the Share Allocation Schedule shall be amended accordingly. 

   

 (ii) To the extent that the Estimated Working Capital Amount is less than the Working Capital Threshold (such deficiency, if any, the " _Estimated Working Capital Deficit_ "), then, at LIHs election, either: 

   

 (A) LIH shall contribute cash to the Company in an amount equal to the Estimated Working Capital Deficit immediately prior to Closing; or 

   

 (B) the number of the LIH LLC Shares to be issued to LIH pursuant to  _Sections 2.3_ and _2.5(c)(ii)_ above shall be reduced by that number (rounded to the nearest whole number) which is the quotient of the Estimated Working Capital Deficit divided by the Exchange Price, and the Share Allocation Schedule shall be amended accordingly. 

   

 (c) _Post-Closing Balance Sheet_. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date), Equity One shall deliver to LIH a balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing Balance Sheet_ "), including a calculation of Working Capital derived from the Post-Closing Balance Sheet, together with worksheets which detail any adjustments and the basis thereof and other information used in the preparation of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Working Capital reasonably requested by LIH. Equity One shall use reasonable best efforts to make all of its work papers underlying the preparation of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Working Capital reasonably available to LIH and its representatives and to consult in good faith with LIH and its 

   ##### 

  

   

representatives during the review period set forth below. The Post-Closing
Balance Sheet shall include a calculation of the Working Capital at the
Closing and shall be binding upon the parties upon approval of such Post-
Closing Balance Sheet by LIH. If LIH does not agree with any portion or line
item contained within the Post-Closing Balance Sheet and/or the calculation
of Working Capital at the Closing stated thereon, and the parties
cannot mutually agree on the same, then within forty-five (45) days following
receipt by LIH of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet, the parties shall appoint
an independent auditor to resolve such dispute as promptly as reasonably
practicable. The independent auditor shall be a nationally recognized
certified public accounting firm that is not rendering (and during
the preceding two (2) year period has not rendered) audit or other material
services to any of the Company, LIH or its parent or Equity One. If the
parties are unable to agree on such independent auditor, then the respective
accounting firms of each of LIH and Equity One shall choose the independent
auditor. The independent auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine,
based solely on the presentations by LIH and Equity One, and not by
independent review, only those issues still in dispute. The fees and expenses
associated with such review by the independent auditor shall be borne equally
by Equity One and LIH. The independent auditors determination shall be made
within thirty (30) days of its engagement or as soon thereafter as possible
and shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to LIH and Equity One
and shall be enforceable in a court of Law. 

   

 (d) _Post Closing Adjustment_. 

   

 (i) To the extent that the Working Capital set forth on the Post-Closing Balance Sheet (the " _Final Working Capital Amount_ ") exceeds the Estimated Working Capital Amount (such excess, if any, the " _Working Capital Increase Amount_ "), Equity One shall cause EQY-CSC to issue additional LIH LLC Shares to LIH in an amount (rounded to the nearest whole number) equal to the quotient of the Working Capital Increase Amount divided by the Exchange Price ( _provided_ , that to the extent such Working Capital Increase Amount, when added to the amount of any Estimated Working Capital Surplus divided by the Exchange Price pursuant to  _Section 3.1(b)(i)(B)_, exceeds $2,500,000 in the aggregate, such excess amount shall be divided by the EQY VWAP Price instead of the Exchange Price), and the Share Allocation Schedule shall be amended accordingly. 

   

 (ii) To the extent that the Final Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated Working Capital Amount (such deficiency, if any, the " _Working Capital Decrease Amount_ "), then Equity One shall cause EQY-CSC to reduce and cancel that number of LIH LLC Shares previously issued to LIH pursuant to _Sections 2.3_ and _2.5(c)(ii)_ hereunder in an amount equal to that number (rounded to the nearest whole number) which is the quotient of the Working Capital Decrease Amount divided by the Exchange Price ( _provided_ , that to the extent the number of LIH LLC Shares have been previously increased pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(i)(B)_ , then the value at which LIH LLC Shares to be reduced and canceled under this clause (ii) shall be commensurate, pro rata, with the value at which 

   ##### 

  

   

such LIH LLC Shares were previously increased pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)(i)(B)_ ), and the Share Allocation Schedule shall be amended
accordingly. 

   

 (e) As used herein, " _Working Capital_ " has the meaning set forth on, and shall be calculated in accordance with, _Schedule 3.1_. 

   

 (f) Any increases or decreases to the number of LIH LLC Shares pursuant to this  _Section 3.1_ shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the consideration issued by EQY-CSC for the contribution of the Company Common Stock by LIH hereunder. 

   

 (g) As used herein, " _Exchange Price_ " means $16.50, subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 

   

 (i) _Upon Dividends, Distributions, Subdivisions, Splits or Consolidations_. If, at any time after the date of this Agreement, the number of outstanding shares of EQY Common Stock is (A) increased by a dividend or share distribution payable in shares of EQY Common Stock (or in securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, EQY Common Stock) or by a subdivision or forward split of the outstanding shares of EQY Common Stock or (B) decreased by a consolidation or reverse split of the outstanding shares of EQY Common Stock, then the Exchange Price shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exchange Price immediately prior to such event by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of EQY Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of EQY Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter; _provided_ that if a dividend or share distribution is payable in securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, EQY Common Stock, then for purposes of determining the denominator above, the number of shares of EQY Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter shall be deemed to include the maximum number of shares of EQY Common Stock (assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to convertibility, exercisability or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange of such securities. 

   

 (ii) _Other Adjustments_. In the event of any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change in the outstanding shares of EQY Common Stock at any time after the date of this Agreement for which an adjustment is not otherwise provided under the foregoing _clause (i)_ , the Exchange Price shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the effects of such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change. 

  

 3.2 _Survival_. The provisions of this _Article 3_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely.

The exercise of such rights and corresponding automatic extension of the Termination Date shall be at the election of Equity One; _provided_ , that at all times during such extension period Equity One shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Mortgage Consents. 

   

 (d) If the Mortgage Consent is still not received by the Termination Date (as extended pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.13(c)_, if applicable), then Equity One and LIH shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(ii)_.

LIH shall have the right until the Closing to supplement or amend the LIH Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising or discovered after the date hereof that, if existing or known at the date hereof, would have been required to be set forth or described in the LIH Disclosure Schedule. Any such supplement or amendment of the LIH Disclosure Schedule shall not give rise to any right of Equity One to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , such supplement or amendment shall not impair Equity Ones right to terminate this 

   ##### 

  

    

Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(iii)_ in the event the facts, events

      ##### 

  

    

party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents. 

   

 5.20 _Name Change_. At Equity Ones discretion, and as soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event earlier than January 1, 2011), Equity One shall (directly or indirectly) cause EQY-CSC to cause the Company to file a certificate of amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company for the purpose of changing the Companys name. 

   

 5.21 _Amendment of Organizational Documents_. LIH shall, and shall cause the Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect, as of immediately prior to the Closing, such procedural amendments to the Companys bylaws as may be requested by Equity One; _provided_ , that such amendments would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on LIH, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or that, in the good faith judgment of LIH, may cause LIH to be treated as having engaged in a deemed exchange of its equity interest in the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

   

 5.22 _The Registration Statement_. Prior to the Closing, Equity One shall prepare, file with the SEC and cause to be declared effective a registration statement (which shall be an "automatic shelf registration statement" as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act on Form S-3, if available) permitting the public offering and sale on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of all shares of EQY Common Stock received by LIH under the Transaction Documents or issuable in redemption of LIH LLC Shares (the " _Registration Statement_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that before filing such Registration Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, Equity One will furnish copies of all such documents proposed to be filed to LIH and provide reasonable time for LIH and its counsel to comment upon such documents. As of its effective date and as of the Closing Date, the Registration Statement will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In connection with the filing of the Registration Statement, LIH shall furnish in writing to Equity One such information regarding LIH (and any of its Affiliates) requested by Equity One as is necessary or it reasonably deems advisable for inclusion in the Registration Statement. 

   

 5.23 _Cooperation Relating to Tax Opinions, EQY Promissory Note "Bringdown," and FIRPTA Relief Request_ LIH shall reasonably cooperate with Equity Ones counsel in connection with the preparation and delivery of the opinion referenced in _Section 2.5(d)(i)(C)_, and Equity One shall reasonably cooperate with LIHs counsel in connection with the preparation and delivery of the opinion referenced in _Section 2.5(d)(i)(B)_. Such cooperation shall include but not be limited to delivering such representations in the form of an officer certificate as may be reasonably requested by counsel to LIH and/or counsel to Equity One, upon which such counsel may rely for purposes of rendering its opinion; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.23_ shall be read to require Equity One to commit to taking any action, or refrain from taking any action, with respect to the Properties, the Company or EQY-CSC following the Closing. In order to facilitate the delivery of the opinions referenced in _Section 2.5(d)(i)(B)_ and  _Section 2.5(d)(i)(C)_, LIH and Equity One shall reasonably cooperate in connection with 

   ##### 

  

   

procuring a "bringdown" confirmation from a nationally recognized financial
advisory firm reasonably acceptable to LIH of the opinion concerning the EQY
Promissory Note delivered as of the day hereof and attached hereto as
_Exhibit J_, it being understood that such opinion is, and such bringdown
confirmation may be, subject to customary assumptions and limitations and
shall be based upon customary representations concerning matters such as
leverage ratios and payment expectations with respect to the EQY Promissory
Note. LIH shall keep Equity One informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of the FIRPTA Relief Request, and, upon request, shall provide Equity
One with copies of all material written communication received from the IRS
and/or U.S. Treasury Department relating thereto. 

   

 5.24 _Intercompany Debt_. At or prior to the Closing, LIH shall deliver to Equity One evidence reasonably satisfactory to Equity One that (i) claims with respect to £500,000,000 (GBP) of intercompany debt of CSC has been subordinated to claims against CSC under any Transaction Document or (ii) CSC has been capitalized such that CSCs net equity is at least £300,000,000 (GBP). From and after the Closing Date and until such time as CSC no longer has any obligations under any Transaction Document, CSC covenants and agrees that it shall maintain such claim subordination or level of net equity. 

   

 5.25 _Modification of EQY Promissory Note_. To the extent required to facilitate the delivery of the bringdown certificate described in _Section 5.23_, the parties agree to make such amendments to the terms and conditions of the EQY Promissory Note to be delivered pursuant to _Section 2.2_ as shall be reasonably necessary; _provided_ , that neither party shall be obligated hereunder to consent to such changes to terms and conditions as would have a material adverse effect on the benefits expected to be received, or costs incurred, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 5.26 _FIRPTA Withholding_. Pursuant to IRS Notice 89-57 and Treas. Reg. § 1.1445-2(d)(2)(i)(A), LIH shall deliver to EQY-CSC at or prior to the Closing the Notice of Nonrecognition in the form of _Exhibit F_ hereto (the " _Notice of Nonrecognition_ "). Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the Notice of Nonrecognition by EQY-CSC, Equity One shall cause EQY-CSC to deliver the Notice of Nonrecognition to the IRS as required by Treas. Reg. § 1.1445-2(d)(2)(i)(B), together with a cover letter in the form of _Exhibit F-1_ hereto. Equity One shall cause EQY-CSC to (i) certify to LIH that EQY-CSC has satisfied its obligations under this _Section 5.26_, (ii) provide LIH with a copy of any certified mail certificates or receipts related to the Notice of Nonrecognition and its delivery to and receipt by the IRS, and (iii) provide LIH with copies of any correspondence between EQY-CSC and the IRS concerning the Notice of Nonrecognition. 

   

 5.27 _Modifications to Reflect United Kingdom Tax Requirements_. The parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) LIH is subject to tax under the laws of the United Kingdom; and (ii) in order for the contribution of the Company Common Stock to EQY-CSC to qualify for tax-free roll-over treatment under the tax laws of the United Kingdom, EQY-CSC must be treated as a "company" or "corporation" for purposes of such law. In light of the foregoing, prior to Closing, the parties agree to make such changes or amendments to the Operating Agreement as may be requested by LIH that are reasonably necessary to ensure that, to the reasonable satisfaction of LIH, EQY-CSC is classified as a "company" or "corporation" for purposes of the 

   ##### 

  

   

tax laws of the United Kingdom;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such changes
or amendments shall not have a material adverse impact on Equity One or EQY-
CSC.

If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated pursuant to this _Section 7.1_: 

   

 (i) each party shall return all documents and other material received from the other relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, to the other party ( _provided_ , that a party may keep one copy of such materials for its legal files); and 

   

 (ii) all confidential information received by either party with respect to the businesses of the other party shall be treated in accordance with _Sections 5.11_ and _7.2_ which shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) In the event Equity One or LIH seeks to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(a)(iii)_ or _(iv)_ , respectively, written notice of such partys intent to so terminate shall forthwith be given to the other party, specifying the grounds for such termination and the proposed effective date of such termination (which may be no earlier than ten (10) days from the date of such notice). The defaulting party shall have the right to cure such default to the reasonable satisfaction of the non-defaulting party before such termination effective date, whereupon the termination notice shall lapse and be of no further effect.

 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in _Section 7.1_, (A) this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of (i) _Article 1_, (ii) _Section 5.10_, but only the indemnification obligations specified therein, (iii) _Section 5.11_ relating to the obligation of the parties to keep confidential certain information and data, which shall survive for two (2) years following such termination, (iv) _Section 5.15_ relating to certain expenses, (v) _Section 5.16_ relating to finders fees and brokers fees, (vi) _Section 7.1_ and this  _Section 7.2_, and (vii) _Article 9_, and (B) any other Transaction 

     ##### 

  

    

Document that has at the date of termination of this Agreement been executed
and delivered shall automatically terminate and shall become null and void
and of no further force and effect, except for any provision thereof that
such other Transaction Document expressly provides shall survive a
termination. Nothing in this _Section 7.2_ shall be deemed to release
any party from any liability for fraud or for any breach by such party of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document that
has at the date of termination of this Agreement been executed and delivered
or to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by any
other party of its surviving obligations under this Agreement or such
other Transaction Document. 

    

 7.3 _Election of Remedies_. 

   

 (a) _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by them in accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and that each party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or any other equitable relief to prevent breaches of the provisions hereof (without any requirement to post any bond or other security in connection with seeking such relief). In addition, the parties agree that the Company and the Properties have unique attributes such that an adequate remedy would not be available at Law for a breach of this Agreement. Each party shall have the right to seek specific performance or other equitable relief in connection with enforcing the terms hereof (without any requirement to post any bond or other security in connection with seeking such relief) in accordance with _Section 9.7_. The parties agree not to raise any objections or defenses to the availability of equitable remedies (including that a remedy at Law would be adequate) to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by LIH, on the one hand, or Equity One, on the other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the parties under this Agreement, in each case prior to, and in connection with, the Closing. The parties agree that any party hereto may seek a specific performance remedy in lieu of terminating this Agreement even if such party otherwise is entitled to terminate this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section 7.3_ is intended to limit or restrict any other remedies available to a party except as expressly provided in _Section 7.3(b)_ and _(c)_. 

   

 (b) _Default by LIH_. Without limiting _Section 6.2_, if LIH is in material default with respect to the performance of any of its obligations hereunder on or prior to the Closing Date, then Equity One, at its election and as its sole and exclusive remedy, may elect to waive any objections, defects or imperfections of LIHs performance and proceed to Closing and seek an injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief or order to specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement to which such default applies and, in any event, to specifically enforce the Closing to occur. 

   

 (c) _Default by Equity One_. Without limiting _Section 6.3_, if Equity One is in material default with respect to the performance of any of its obligations hereunder on or prior to the Closing Date, then LIH, at its election and as its sole and exclusive remedy, may elect to waive any objections, defects or imperfections of Equity Ones performance and proceed to Closing and seek an injunction or injunctions or other equitable relief or 

   ##### 

  

   

order to specifically enforce the provisions of this Agreement to which such
default applies and, in any event, to specifically enforce the Closing to
occur. 

   

 (d) _Alternative Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of a defaulting party hereunder pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought by the non-defaulting party, then the non-defaulting party may pursue an action for monetary damages for breach of this Agreement. If such a court has granted an award of monetary damages for such breach, the non-defaulting party may enforce such award and accept damages for such breach. 

   

 7.4 _FIRPTA Relief Request_. 

   

 (a) In the event that LIH receives notice from the IRS that the IRS shall not grant the FIRPTA Relief Request, then LIH shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Equity One, which notice shall include copies of all correspondence received from the IRS; _provided_ , LIH shall be required to deliver such notice of termination of this Agreement to Equity One if the amount of the aggregate liability covered by Section 3.9 of the Tax Matters Agreement exceeds $10 million. Any such notice of termination is referred to as a " _FIRPTA Termination Notice_ ". Any such FIRPTA Termination Notice shall be delivered by LIH to Equity One in writing within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the notice from the IRS. As soon as practicable following delivery of such FIRPTA Termination Notice (but in any event before the end of the first Business Day following the date of delivery of such FIRPTA Termination Notice), LIH shall deposit an amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee (the " _Escrowed Termination Funds_ ") with an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to the parties (it being agreed that Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP shall be deemed reasonably acceptable to the parties) (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). In the event that Equity One receives a FIRPTA Termination Notice from LIH pursuant to this _Section 7.4(a)_, Equity One shall have the right, at its sole election by written notice delivered to LIH within five (5) Business Days after Equity Ones receipt of such FIRPTA Termination Notice and subject to the terms of Section 3.9 of the Tax Matters Agreement, to elect not to accept any such termination (any such notice from Equity One electing not to accept such termination being referred to as a " _Termination Rejection Notice_ "). In the event Equity One delivers a Termination Rejection Notice to LIH within five (5) Business Days after Equity Ones receipt of such FIRPTA Termination Notice, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the other conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article 6_ hereof, the parties shall proceed to the Closing without prejudice to any other terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document ( _provided_ , that the opinions of counsel pursuant to _Sections 2.5(d)(i)(B)_ and _2.5(d)(i)(C)_ ) will not be required). The Escrow Agent shall be instructed to release the Escrowed Termination Funds (i) to Equity One (a) as promptly as practicable upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a written notice from Equity One that Equity One is accepting the FIRPTA Termination Notice and this Agreement shall be deemed terminated or (b) on the sixth (6th) Business Day following the date of delivery of the FIRPTA Termination Notice if Equity One has not delivered a Termination Rejection Notice to LIH within five (5) Business Days after Equity Ones receipt of the FIRPTA Termination Notice and this Agreement shall be deemed terminated or (ii) to 

   ##### 

  

   

LIH in the event Equity One delivers a Termination Rejection Notice to LIH
within five (5) Business Days after Equity Ones receipt of such FIRPTA
Termination Notice. 

   

 (b) In the event that (i) LIH receives notice from the IRS that the IRS shall not grant the FIRPTA Relief Request, (ii) the amount of the aggregate liability covered by Section 3.9 of the Tax Matters Agreement does not exceed $10 million and (iii) LIH affirmatively agrees in writing to assume all liability relating to the FIRPTA Relief Request, then the Agreement shall not be terminated pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ and the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 6.3(f)_ shall be deemed satisfied, whereupon, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the other conditions to the Closing set forth in  _Article 6_ hereof, the parties shall proceed to the Closing without prejudice to any other terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document ( _provided_ , that the opinions of counsel pursuant to _Sections 2.5(d)(i)(B)_ and _2.5(d)(i)(C)_ ) will not be required); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that LIH does not affirmatively agree in writing to assume the amount of the aggregate liability covered by Section 3.9 of the Tax Matters Agreement under this _Section 7.4(b)_, and gives written notice thereof within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the notice from the IRS, then Equity One shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by written notice delivered to LIH within five (5) Business Days after the date LIH provides written notice to Equity One that LIH is not assuming such liability pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_. 

   

 (c) The " _Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to a cash payment of $5,000,000. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable in accordance with this _Section 7.4_ , the payment of the Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which Equity One would otherwise be entitled to assert against LIH or any of its respective assets with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to Equity One. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable under this _Section 7.4_, the rights to payment of the Termination Fee (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(a)(v)_ and (ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing. 

   

 (e) CSC and LIH acknowledge that the agreements contained in _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Equity One would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if LIH fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, Equity One commences a suit that results in a final adjudication on the merits against LIH for the Termination Fee, LIH shall pay to Equity One interest on the Termination Fee from and including the date payment of the Termination Fee was due to but excluding the date of 

   ##### 

  

   

actual payment at the prime rate of Bank of America, National Association in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made, and LIH shall pay to
Equity One all of the reasonable costs incurred by Equity One to secure
payment of the Termination Fee. 

  

 7.5 _No Shop_. In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ above, and Equity One accepts such termination, then notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) for a period of 180 days following the effective date of such termination, LIH agrees not to (and shall cause its controlled affiliates not to) market for sale or other disposition either (a) the Company and its subsidiaries substantially as a whole or (b) any of the Properties set forth on _Schedule 7.5_, or entertain or discuss any offer to purchase or acquire any of the foregoing with any person other than Equity One and its affiliates and (ii) during the 180-day period starting on the date that is 181 days following the effective date of such termination, LIH agrees that it shall not (and shall cause its controlled affiliates to not) enter into any exclusive negotiations with third parties with respect to the sale or other disposition of either (a) the Company and its subsidiaries substantially as a whole or (b) any of the Properties set forth on _Schedule 7.5_. 

   

 7.6 _Amended EQY Charter_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Equity One shall have the right, by written notice to LIH, to extend the Termination Date set forth in _Section 7.1_ by up to forty-five (45) days for the purpose of obtaining the approval of Equity Ones stockholders to the Amended EQY Charter; _provided_ , that at all times during such extended period Equity One shall diligently use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such approval.

From and after the Closing Date, LIH agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Equity One, the Company and EQY-CSC from and against all Losses which are incurred or suffered by any of them based upon, arising out of, in connection with or by reason of (i) the breach by LIH of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in _Section 4.1(s)_ hereof, the indemnification obligations for which are addressed exclusively in the Tax Matters Agreement), or (ii) failure by LIH to perform any of the covenants or agreements applicable to it under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) no claim for indemnification shall be made hereunder unless and until the value of all indemnifiable Losses, in the aggregate, shall equal or exceed $2,500,000 as of the date such claim or claims are made, and then, only for the amount of such Losses in excess of $2,500,000, and (B) such indemnification obligations shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $40,000,000 ( _provided_ , that the foregoing threshold and cap shall not apply to (x) Losses arising as a result of the breach of any LIH Fundamental Representation, (y) the failure to perform the covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 5.13(b)_ or _5.15_ , or (z) claims based on fraud), and (C) no claim for indemnification shall be made under clause (i) above to the extent any of the individuals listed for Equity One on _Schedule 3_ attached hereto had actual knowledge, as of the date hereof, of such breach. Equity One, the Company and EQY-CSC shall not be entitled to any recovery unless a claim for indemnification is made in accordance with  _Section 8.3_ and within the time period set forth in such _Section 8.3_ (and in any event prior to the date the 

      ##### 

  

    

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are subject of such
claim cease to survive as set forth in _Section 8.4_) and the person seeking
indemnification complies with the procedures set forth in such Section. 

   

 8.2 _Indemnification by Equity One_. From and after the Closing Date, Equity One shall indemnify and hold LIH harmless from and against any and all Losses which are incurred or suffered by it based upon, arising out of, in connection with or by reason of (i) the breach by Equity One of its representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement (other than those set forth in _Section 4.2(x)_ hereof, the indemnification obligations for which are addressed exclusively in the Tax Matters Agreement) or (ii) failure by Equity One to perform any of the covenants or agreements applicable to it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no claim for indemnification shall be made hereunder unless and until the value of all indemnifiable Losses, in the aggregate, shall equal or exceed $2,500,000 as of the date such claim or claims are made, and then, only for the amount of such Losses in excess of $2,500,000, (B) such indemnification obligations shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $40,000,000 ( _provided_ , the foregoing threshold and cap shall not apply to (x) Losses arising as a result of any Investigation or the breach of any Equity One Fundamental Representation or (y) claims based on fraud), and (C) no claim for indemnification shall be made under clause (i) above to the extent any of the individuals listed for LIH on _Schedule 3_ attached hereto had actual knowledge, as of the date hereof, of such breach; _provided_ , that the limitation in clause (C) shall not be applicable with respect to any breach of Equity Ones representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 4.2(h)(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, LIHs rights to indemnification and to assert a failure of the condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_ as a result of a breach of Equity Ones representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.2(h)(b)_ shall not be limited or otherwise restricted as a result of any knowledge LIH has now or hereinafter obtains with respect to the facts giving rise to such breach. LIH shall not be entitled to any recovery unless a claim for indemnification is made in accordance with _Section 8.3_ and within the time period set forth in such _Section 8.3_ (and in any event prior to the date the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements that are subject of such claim cease to survive as set forth in _Section 8.4_) and the person seeking indemnification complies with the procedures set forth in _Section 8.3_. 

    

 8.3 _Indemnification Procedure_  

   

 (a) Each person entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall give written notice to the indemnifying party or parties from whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), promptly after obtaining knowledge of any claim that it may have under this _Article 8_ and, in the case of a Third Party Claim, not later than fifteen (15) days thereafter. The notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the claim and the basis for indemnification and, in the case of a Third Party Claim, a copy of any related third party demand, claim or complaint. Failure to give the notice in a timely manner shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article 8_ except to the extent such failure prejudices the Indemnifying Party in relation to such claim. 

   

 (b) _Defense of Third Party Claims_. If a claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall arise from any action that involves an indemnifiable claim (other than 

   ##### 

  

   

a claim brought by a governmental authority with respect to Taxes the defense
of which is addressed exclusively in the Tax Matters Agreement) brought by a
third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party may assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim, provided the Indemnifying Party
proceeds with diligence and in good faith with respect thereto. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim, the defense
shall be conducted by counsel chosen by the Indemnifying Party, which shall
be reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee, _provided_ that the Indemnitee shall
retain the right to employ its own counsel and participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim which shall be at its own expense unless (i) the
Indemnitee is advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying
Party, that use of counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice would be
expected to give rise to a conflict of interest, (ii) the Indemnifying
Party shall not have employed counsel to represent the Indemnitee within a
reasonable time after notice of the assertion of any such claim or
institution of any such action or proceeding, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall authorize the Indemnitee in writing to employ separate counsel at the
reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party. In no event shall
the Indemnifying Party be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
one counsel (other than local counsel) for all Indemnitees with respect to
any claim indemnified under this  _Article 8_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 8.3_, no Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
settle any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought under this
_Article 8_ without the Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the sole relief
_provided_ that is binding on the Indemnitee is monetary damages that
are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (c) _Cooperation in Defense_. Each party indemnified under any indemnity contained in this Agreement shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of the Third Party Claim pursuant to which the Indemnifying Party is alleged to have liability. 

   

 8.4 _Survival_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all the representations and warranties set forth in _Article 4_ shall survive for a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any claim based on (i) fraud, or (ii) a failure to perform the covenants and agreements set forth in _Sections 5.13(b)_ or  _5.15_ , will survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The representations and warranties of LIH set forth in _Sections 4.1(a_) (Organization and Good Standing), _4.1(b)_ (Capitalization), _4.1(e)_ (Due Authorization; Validity of Agreements) and _4.1(i)_ (Company Common Stock) (collectively, the " _LIH Fundamental Representations_ ") shall not expire; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , however, that the representations and warranties of Equity One set forth in  _Sections 4.2(b)_ (Organization and Good Standing), _4.2(d)_ (Capitalization),  _4.2(e)_ (Equity One Common Stock), _4.2(f)_ (Due Authorization; Validity of Agreements), _4.2(g)_ (EQY Promissory Note), _4.2(h)(b)_ (No Violation or Default) and _4.2(ee)_ (EQY-CSC) (collectively, the " _Equity One Fundamental Representations_ ") shall not expire; and _provided_ _further_ , however, that the survival of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1(s)_ (Tax Matters) and _4.2(x)_ (Tax Matters) are addressed exclusively in the Tax Matters Agreement. All of the covenants and other 

   ##### 

  

   

agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the
date or dates specified therein. 

   

 (b) In the event that any written notice of a claim shall be given hereunder in accordance with the terms of this _Article 8_ within the applicable survival period, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements that are the subject of such indemnity claim shall survive until such claim is finally resolved but only with respect to such claim and any directly related matters. 

  

 8.5 _Insurance_. The indemnity obligations of the parties under this _Article 8_ shall be further limited as set forth in this _Section 8.5_. 

   

 (a) If any Losses sustained by an Indemnitee are covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation of another person (other than an affiliate of such Indemnitee), the Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments. If the Indemnitee receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments prior to being indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed under _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.2_, as applicable, with respect to such Losses, the payment by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article 8_ with respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments to the extent related to such Losses, less reasonable attorneys fees, Taxes and other expenses incurred in connection with such recovery. If the Indemnitee receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after being indemnified and held harmless by an Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, the Indemnitee shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment to the extent related to such Losses, less reasonable attorneys fees, Taxes and other expenses incurred in connection with such recovery. If any Indemnitee receives payment under this _Article 8_ on account of a claim that an Indemnifying Party believes in good faith is covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation of another person (other than an affiliate of such Indemnitee), that Indemnitee shall (i) on written request of the Indemnifying Party assign, to the extent assignable, its rights under such insurance policy or indemnification, contribution or similar obligation with respect to such claim to the Indemnifying Party and (ii) be relieved of any further obligation to pursue collection of such insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar obligation (except that, if requested to do so by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Partys sole expense, to collect any such insurance or indemnification, contribution or similar obligation). 

   

 (b) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this _Article 8_ shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnitee arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss and shall be increased by the amount of the income Tax, if any, attributable to the receipt of such indemnity payments; _provided_ that if an entity filing Tax Returns as a REIT is the Indemnitee, it shall be assumed that no Tax benefits are realized. 

        ##### 

  

     

 (c) No claim for indemnification shall be made against LIH with respect to any Loss to the extent such Loss was reflected as a liability in the Final Working Capital Amount. 

   

 8.6 _Exclusivity_. After the Closing, to the extent permitted by Law, the indemnities set forth in this _Article 8_ shall be the exclusive remedies of each party hereto and its respective officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates for any breach of this Agreement (other than claims based on fraud), and the parties shall not be entitled to, and hereby waive their rights to, a rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect of any such breach of this Agreement (other than claims based on fraud). Nothing in this _Section 8.6_ shall limit the indemnification provisions set forth in any of the other Transaction Documents.

Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in (i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to the service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 9.7_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.2_.

Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby.
