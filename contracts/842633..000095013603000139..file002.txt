Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section  401(a) of the Code
is so qualified and has heretofore been determined by  the IRS to be so
qualified, and each trust created thereunder has  heretofore been determined
by the IRS to be exempt from tax under the  provisions of Section 501(a) of
the Code, and nothing has occurred since  the date of any such determination
that could reasonably be expected to  give the IRS grounds to revoke such

19    any Employee Plan to any material tax or material penalty on
prohibited  transactions imposed by Section 4975 of ERISA or the sanctions
imposed  under Title I of ERISA.   (h) No "pension plan" (as defined in

of persons described in Section 414 of the Code which includes the  Company
or any Subsidiary. As of the most recent valuation date for each  Employee
Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan, there was not any  amount of
"unfunded current liability" (as defined in Section  412(l)(8)(A) of the
Code) under such Employee Plan and, to the Sellers\'  Knowledge, there are no
facts or circumstances that would materially  change the funded status of any
such Employee Plan.   (i) At no time within the preceding six years has the

the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
either  alone or in combination with another event, (A) any current or
former  employee may become entitled to severance pay or any other payment or
(B)  any compensation due any such employee from the Company or any
Subsidiary  may be increased or the time of payment or vesting may become 
accelerated. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement will not result in, or satisfy a condition to the payment of 
compensation that would, in combination with any other payment, result  in,
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of  the
Code.   (l) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.13(l), none of the 
Stockholders, the Company nor any Subsidiary have disseminated in writing  or
otherwise broadly or generally notified current or former employees of  the
Company or any Subsidiary of any intent or commitment (whether or not 
legally binding) to create or implement any additional plans, funds, 
programs, agreements or arrangements for the benefit of any current or 
former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary or to materially amend, 
modify or terminate any existing Employee Plan.   (m) Except for the

legal, valid and binding contract or agreement of the Company or a
Subsidiary, as applicable, subject only to the General Enforceability
Exceptions, and there is no default, event of default, or breach or event

a  specific date or as of the date of this    32    Agreement, in which
case such representations and warranties shall be so  true and correct or so
true and correct in all material respects, as the  case may be, as of such
specific date or as of the date of this  Agreement, respectively).   (b)

Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all respects, and  all
of the representations and warranties of the Stockholders and of the  Company
set forth in the Agreement that are not so qualified shall be  true and
correct in all material respects, in each case, as if such  representations
or warranties were made on and as of the date of this  Agreement and as of
the Closing Date (except to the extent such  representations and warranties
speak as of a specific date or as of the  date of this Agreement, in which
case such representations and warranties  shall be so true and correct or so
true and correct in all material  respects, as the case may be, as of such
specific date or as of the date  of this Agreement, respectively).   (b)

------------------------   9.1 TERMINATION. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing Date:   (a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and
Riverside (acting  on its behalf and for the other Stockholders);   (b) by
Buyer or Riverside (acting on its behalf and for the  other Stockholders),
upon written notice to the other party, if the  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement have not been consummated on  or prior to July 27, 2003 (the
"OUTSIDE DATE"), unless such failure of  consummation shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking such  termination to perform or observe in all
material respects the covenants  and agreements hereof to be performed or
observed by such party; or    33    (c) by Buyer or Riverside (acting on
its behalf and for the  other Stockholders), upon written notice to the other
party, if a  Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction has issued an
Order or  any other action permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such  Order has become final and non-appealable; provided, however, that
(i)  the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause
(c)  has used its reasonable best efforts to remove such Order;   (d) by
Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach  by the Stockholders
of any agreement, representation or warranty in this  Agreement that has
rendered the satisfaction of any condition to the  obligations of Buyer
impossible and such violation or breach has not been  waived by Buyer;
and   (e) by Riverside (acting on its behalf and for the other 
Stockholders), if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer  of
any agreement, representation or warranty in this Agreement that has 
rendered the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of the 
Stockholders impossible and such violation or breach has not been waived  by
the Stockholders.   9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination
of this Agreement pursuant to SECTION 9.1, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no party will have any liability or any further
obligation to any other party, except as provided in this SECTION 9.2 and
except that nothing herein releases, or may be construed as releasing, any
party hereto from any liability or damage to any other party hereto arising
out of the breaching party\'s willful and material breach in the performance
of any of its covenants, agreements, duties or obligations arising under this
Agreement. The obligations of the parties to this Agreement under SECTIONS
7.2(b) and (c), 7.4 and 10.2 will survive any termination of this
Agreement.    ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL 
-------------------------   10.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
COVENANTS; INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) Except with respect to SECTION 5.1
(Authority) and SECTION  5.2 (Title), which shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, none of the  representations or warranties of the Stockholders
contained in this  Agreement will survive the Closing Date. From and after
the Closing, the  Stockholders shall, severally but not jointly, indemnify
and hold  harmless Buyer from, against and in respect of any and all
liabilities,  damages, losses, penalties, costs, claims, judgments, amounts
paid in  settlement, interest, penalties, assessments, out-of-pocket
expenses  (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements)
(collectively,  "LOSSES") resulting from, incurred in connection with or
arising out of  (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of the  Stockholders made in SECTIONS 5.1 and 5.2 of this Agreement;
(ii) any  Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary existing immediately
prior  to the Closing that is not paid or otherwise retired at the Closing 
(excluding Items 5 (Insurance Premium Note) and 7 (Lease Guaranty) from 
SCHEDULE 4.28); (iii) any bonus or payment payable to any employee, 
consultant or Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is not paid or  otherwise
retired at the    34    Closing; and (iv) the fees and expenses of any
outside professional  services firm retained by the Company or any Subsidiary
in connection  with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are
not paid or  otherwise retired at the Closing.   (b) Except with respect to
SECTION 6.3 (Authorization), which  shall survive the Closing indefinitely,
none of the representations or  warranties of Buyer contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing  Date. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless  the Stockholders from, against and in
respect of any and all Losses  resulting from, incurred in connection with or
arising out of any breach  of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
of Buyer made in  SECTION 6.3 of this Agreement.   (c) All covenants and
agreements contained herein providing  for performance after the Closing Date
will survive in accordance with  their respective terms.   (d) If an
indemnified party becomes aware of any matter that  it believes is subject to
indemnification under this Agreement, including  receipt by any indemnified
party of notice of the commencement of any  action, proceeding, or other
claim in respect of which the indemnified  party intends to seek
indemnification, the indemnified party shall  promptly (and in any event no
later than 30 days after it becomes aware)  notify the indemnifying party in
writing (a "CLAIM NOTICE"); provided,  however, that failure to give such
notice shall not relieve the  indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that  the indemnifying party is actually and materially
prejudiced as a result  of such failure. If the indemnifying party elects in
writing within 15  days of its receipt of a Claim Notice, the indemnifying
party shall be  entitled to assume control of the defense of such action or
claim with  counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;
provided,  however, that:   (i) the indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in  the defense of such claim and to employ counsel at its own
expense  (subject to SECTION 10.1(e)) to assist in the handling of such 
claim;   (ii) no indemnifying party shall consent to the entry of any 
judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an 
unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or  plaintiff to each
indemnified party of a release from all  liability in respect of such claim
or if, pursuant to or as a  result of such consent or settlement, injunctive
or other  equitable relief would be imposed against the indemnified party
or  such judgment or settlement could materially interfere with the 
business, operations or assets of the indemnified party;   (iii) after
written notice by the indemnifying party to the  indemnified party of its
election to assume control of the defense  of any such action in accordance
with the foregoing provisions,  the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified  party hereunder for any legal fees, costs and expenses 
subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with  the
defense thereof, subject to SECTION 10.1(e) below.   35   If the
indemnifying party does not assume control of the defense of such claim in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, the indemnified party shall
have the right to defend such claim in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, including engaging counsel selected by the indemnified party and
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, at the reasonable cost and
expense of the indemnifying party, and the indemnifying party will promptly
reimburse the indemnified party therefore in accordance with this SECTION
10.1; provided, however, that the indemnified party shall not be entitled to
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of such
claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   (e) If both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party  are parties to the action or
claim for which indemnification is sought,  and the indemnified party shall
have been advised in writing by counsel  reasonably acceptable to the
indemnifying party that representation of  both parties by the same counsel
would, in the opinion of such counsel,  be inappropriate due to actual or
potential conflict of interests between  such parties, the indemnified party
may employ its own counsel and  otherwise participate in the defense of such
action or claim at the  indemnifying party\'s expense.   (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party has the right  and in no event
shall this Agreement limit the right of a party to pursue  any remedy that
may be available to such party under applicable Law in  the event of
fraud.   10.2 EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses (including all
legal, accounting, broker, finder or investment banker fees) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
to be paid by the party incurring such expenses except as expressly provided
herein; provided, however, that any costs and expenses incurred by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby are to be
paid by the Stockholders.   10.3 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement is
binding upon and inures to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns, but is not assignable by either party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto.   10.4
THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except with respect to the recipients of the
Management Bonuses in accordance with SECTION 2.2(e), each party
hereto intends that this Agreement does not benefit or create any right or
cause of action in or on behalf of any Person other than the parties
hereto.   10.5 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties shall execute such
further instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be
necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Each party hereto shall

requested by such other parties, to enforce rights and obligations herein
provided.   10.6 NOTICES. Any notice or other communication provided for

without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the

provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision
will be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.   10.13

performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
