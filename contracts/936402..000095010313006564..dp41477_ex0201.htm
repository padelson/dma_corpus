AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 11, 2013 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among SHIRE PHARMACEUTICAL HOLDINGS IRELAND LIMITED, a
company incorporated in Ireland ("Parent"), VENUS NEWCO, INC., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
VIROPHARMA INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and, solely
for the purposes set forth in Section 10.16, SHIRE PLC, a company incorporated
in Jersey ("Parent Holdco").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $0.002 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Parent proposes to cause Merger Sub to make a tender
offer to purchase any (for the avoidance of doubt, subject to the Minimum
Tender Condition) and all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the
"Offer") for consideration of a price per share of Company Common Stock of
$50.00 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer
and this Agreement, the "Offer Price"), net to the seller in cash, without
interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 251(h) of Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), Merger Sub will
be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, with the Company surviving the
Merger as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and, subject to certain
limitations set forth herein, each share of Company Common Stock that is not
tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer
Price;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (a) adopted and
declared the advisability of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) declared that it is in
the best interests of the Company and the stockholders of the Company (other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries) that the Company enter into this Agreement
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, in each case on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, (c) declared that the terms of the
Offer and the Merger are fair to the Company and the Company's stockholders
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) and (d) resolved to recommend that
the Company's stockholders accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has
unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the
other transactions

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and Merger
Sub and (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various Offer Conditions and
conditions to the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE OFFER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Offer.

  

  

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 9.1 and none of the events set
forth in clause (iii) (other than in paragraph (f) thereof) of Exhibit A shall
exist or have occurred and be continuing, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act"), the Offer. The
obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the "Offer
Conditions").

  

  

(b) Expiration of the Offer. The Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City
time, on the 20th Business Day following the commencement of the Offer
(determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act); provided,
that if the initial expiration of the Offer would otherwise be scheduled to
occur on December 20, 2013, December 23, 2013 or December 24, 2013, the Offer
shall expire at 6:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 26, 2013 (such
time, or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive, in whole
or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the Offer; provided,
however, that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub
shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in
the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change, modify or waive the
Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A or
modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse to any holders of
Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.1(b),
extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date of the Offer, (vi) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or
supplement any of the terms of the Offer in a manner adverse to any holders of
Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the
Company, (A) without limiting Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations under the
following

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

sentence, extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments
not more than ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties
hereto may agree) each, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer
any of the Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent
waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waived and (B) extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable
to the Offer or any period otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and
Merger Sub agree that, to the extent requested in writing by the Company prior
to any then-scheduled Expiration Date of the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) (I) if any of the Offer Conditions set forth
in clause (ii) of Exhibit A or in paragraph (a) or (b) of clause (iii) of
Exhibit A shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent
or Merger Sub, waived, and provided, that it is reasonably expected that such
condition or conditions shall be satisfied prior to the Termination Date,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer period as the parties hereto may
agree), until such time as such Offer Conditions are satisfied (but not beyond
the Termination Date) and (II) if any of the Minimum Tender Condition or the
Offer Conditions set forth in paragraph (d) or (e) of clause (iii) of Exhibit
A shall not have been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger
Sub, waived on such then-scheduled Expiration Date, but all the other Offer
Conditions set forth in Exhibit A (other than in paragraph (f) of clause (iii)
of Exhibit A) shall be satisfied on such then-scheduled Expiration Date,
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to
ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree)
each, for an aggregate period of time of not more than twenty (20) Business
Days; provided, however, that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Termination Date. In no event shall Merger Sub be required to
extend the Offer at any time that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to
terminate this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Offer Closing. On the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Merger Sub, waiver of the
Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
accept and pay for (subject to any withholding of Tax pursuant to Section
1.1(g)) all shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date of the Offer.
Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and
subject to the Offer Conditions is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date."

  

  

(d) Termination of Offer. The Offer may not be terminated prior to its
Expiration Date, unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with Article IX. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1, in each case
prior to the Offer Closing, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Company
Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

  

  

(e) Schedule TO; Offer Documents. On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO filed under cover of Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which
shall contain an offer to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the "Offer
Documents"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be set
forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents, and shall provide
the Company with copies of all correspondence between them and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to give the Company the opportunity to
participate in any substantive telephonic or in-person communications with the
staff of the SEC related thereto. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination
thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments.

  

  

(f) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to
the Offer.

  

  

(g) Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
the Offer to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over by Merger Sub, Parent or the Paying
Agent to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Merger Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent.

  

  

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company represents
that it has been advised that all of its directors and executive officers who
own shares of Company Common Stock intend to tender such shares pursuant to
the Offer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements
or amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") containing the Company
Recommendation and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the
Company. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, (i) in its
entirety, copies of the opinion of the Company Financial Advisor described in
Section 4.23 and (ii) a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly correct any information supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal

any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and shall use its reasonable best

owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such
information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files regarding the beneficial owners of
Company Common Stock) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating the
Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold
in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files
in accordance with the requirements of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
June 20, 2013, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended from time
to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, upon request by the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Company, shall dispose of all copies of such information then in their
possession or control, subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 1.3 Directors.

  

  

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing, and at all times thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate, from time to time, such number of members of
the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent, subject to
compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder,
representation equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, that is the product of (i) the total number of directors
(giving effect to the directors elected or appointed pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the
Offer) bears to (B) the number of shares of the Company Common Stock then
outstanding; provided, however, that in the event that Parent's designees are
appointed or elected to the Board of Directors of the Company, until the
Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company shall have at least three
Continuing Directors.

  

  

(b) The Company shall promptly take all action requested by Parent necessary
or desirable to effect any such election or appointment, including (i)
increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the Company, (ii) filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors of the
Company and (iii) obtaining the resignation of such number of its current
directors as is, in each case, necessary to enable such designees to be so
elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company in compliance
with applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the
Effective Time, Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and applicable NASDAQ
rules).

  

  

(c) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under Section 1.3(a), including mailing to its
stockholders the Information Statement containing the information required by
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, and the Company
agrees to make such mailing concurrently with the mailing of the Schedule
14D-9. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide to the Company on a timely basis
all information required to be included in the Information Statement with
respect to such designees and with respect to Parent's officers, directors and
Affiliates.

  

  

(d) After the Offer Closing, the Company shall also, upon Parent's request,
cause the directors elected or designated by Parent to the Board of Directors
of the Company to serve on and constitute the same percentage (rounded up to
the next whole number) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company of (i)
each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, except for any
committee established to take action with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement, (ii) the board of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board, in each case to
the extent permitted by applicable Law and applicable NASDAQ rules.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) through 1.3(c) and prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there
shall only be one or two Continuing Directors then in office, all of such
Continuing Directors then in office) shall be required to authorize the
Company to consent (i) to amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to waive any
of the Company's rights or remedies under this Agreement, (iii) to extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Merger Sub, (iv) to amend the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, (v) to
authorize any agreement between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) on the other hand or (vi) to make any other
consent by the Company with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that any such
authorization shall (A) not be effective unless there is in office at least
one Continuing Director and (B) constitute the authorization of the Board of
Directors of the Company, and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any committee thereof or any other director of the
Company, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required or permitted.

  

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, a "Continuing Director" shall mean a
member of the Company's Board of Directors who is a member of the Company's
Board of Directors on the date of this Agreement and who are independent
directors for purposes of the continuing listing requirements of NASDAQ. If
the number of directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced to below three
prior to the Effective Time, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be
entitled to designate an individual to fill such vacancy who is not a current
or former officer, director, employee or consultant of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Parent Insider")
and who shall be deemed a Continuing Director for all purposes of this
Agreement, and the Company shall cause such designee to be appointed to the
Board of Directors of the Company. If, notwithstanding compliance with the
foregoing provisions, the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to zero,
then the other directors on the Board of Directors of the Company shall
designate and appoint to the Board of Directors of the Company three
individuals who are not Parent Insiders who shall be deemed Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. The Continuing Directors shall
have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel
to the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined
by the Continuing Directors and shall have the authority to institute any
action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement or
any of the Company's rights hereunder, in each case to the extent reasonably
appropriate to the exercise and discharge of their fiduciary and other duties.

Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all

ARTICLE III

  

  

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, or the holder of any shares of capital stock or other securities of the
Company or Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par
value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned as treasury stock by the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 3.1(d), each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and any shares to be canceled
in accordance with Section 3.1(b)) shall be converted into the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation, in cash and without interest, an
amount equal to the Offer Price paid in the Offer (the "Merger Consideration")
upon surrender of such share of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.2
and in compliance therewith. At the Effective Time, such shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate, or evidence of shares held in book-
entry form, that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Adjustment Events. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into, or exchanged for, a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, split, combination, subdivision or reclassification of shares,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Offer
Price and the Merger Consideration (as applicable) payable

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

per share of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted to fairly reflect the
effects of such transaction.

  

  

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an
agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of Certificates (the "Paying Agent"). At
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deposit with the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at the times necessary for
the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) upon
surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest or
other amounts earned with respect to such funds shall be for the account of
and turned over to Parent in accordance with Section 3.2(g).

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedure. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed (or, if such shares of
Company Common Stock are held in uncertificated, book-entry form, receipt of
an "agent's message" (or such other evidence of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request) by the Paying Agent (it being understood that any
references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock, provided, that the holders of any book-entry shares shall be
deemed to have surrendered any Certificates representing book-entry shares
upon receipt by the Paying Agent of receipt of an "agent's message" (or such
other evidence of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)), and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the amount of Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company, payment of
the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if,
upon presentation to the Paying Agent, such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or
are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

  

 

  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon
the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this Article
III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.

  

  

(d) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash that would otherwise have been payable in respect of any Certificate
that is delivered to a public official in accordance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by
holders of the Company Common Stock immediately prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of Parent or one of its designated Affiliates, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as
the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall
pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or
destroyed Certificate.

  

  

(f) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  

  

(g) Termination of Fund. At any time following the date which is twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any
interest or other amounts earned with respect thereto) that had been made
available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of
Certificates, and thereafter, subject to the time limitations in Section
3.2(d), such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 3.2, any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.2 to pay for shares
of Company Common Stock as to which a Dissenting Stockholder thereof has
properly exercised a demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
shall be returned to Parent or one of its designated Affiliates upon demand.

  

  

Section 3.3 Treatment of Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

  

  

(a) The Company shall take such actions as may be required to effect the
following:

  

  

(i) Company Stock Options. Effective as of five (5) Business Days prior to,
and conditional upon the occurrence of, the Offer Closing, each holder of an
outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an
"incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an
"Incentive Stock Option"), whether such Incentive Stock Option is then vested
or unvested, shall be entitled to exercise such Incentive Stock Option in full
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax) by providing the Company with a
notice of exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise price in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and related
award agreement. Each Incentive Stock Option that is not exercised in
accordance with the prior sentence, and each other Company Stock Option that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Offer Closing (whether
vested or unvested), shall be cancelled as of the Offer Closing and converted
into the right of the holder to receive an amount in cash equal to the product
of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to such cancellation and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option, less any required
withholding Taxes (the "Option Cash Payment"), and as of the Offer Closing
each holder of such a Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment (it being
understood that each Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Offer Closing that has an exercise price equal to or
greater than the Offer Price shall be cancelled as of the Offer Closing
without consideration therefor). The Option Cash Payment shall be made
promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) following the Offer
Closing.

  

  

(ii) Company RSUs. Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Offer Closing (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled as of the
Offer Closing and converted into the right of the holder to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to such
cancellation and (B) the Offer Price, less any required withholding Taxes (the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

"RSU Cash Payment"), and as of the Offer Closing each holder of a Company RSU
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the RSU Cash Payment. The RSU Cash Payment shall be made promptly (and
in any event within five (5) Business Days) following the Offer Closing.

  

  

(iii) Company PSUs. Each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Offer Closing (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled as of the
Offer Closing and converted into the right of the holder to receive an amount
in cash equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock that would be delivered in respect of such Company PSU assuming
achievement of the applicable performance metrics at the maximum level (200%
of target) as of the end of the applicable performance period and (B) the
Offer Price, less any required withholding Taxes (the "PSU Cash Payment"), and
as of the Offer Closing each holder of a Company PSU shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the PSU Cash Payment.
The PSU Cash Payment shall be made promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) following the Offer Closing.

  

  

(iv) ESPP. With respect to the Purchase Plan, (A) participation in the
Purchase Plan shall be limited to those employees who are participants in the
Purchase Plan on the date of this Agreement; (B) no new Offering Period (as
defined in the Purchase Plan), other than the Offering Period in effect as of
the date of this Agreement, shall be authorized, continued or commenced on or
after the date of this Agreement; (C) participants in the Purchase Plan may
not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in
effect on the date of this Agreement; (D) if the Offer Closing occurs prior to
the Offering Termination Date (as defined in the Purchase Plan) with respect
to the Offering Period in effect on the date of this Agreement, then
immediately prior to, and conditional upon the occurrence of, the Offer
Closing, each then-outstanding purchase right under the Purchase Plan shall be
used to purchase from the Company whole shares of Company Common Stock at the
applicable price determined under the terms of the Purchase Plan using the
tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the Offer Closing Date as the Offering
Termination Date for such Offering Period (subject to such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect any shortening of the Offering
Period but otherwise treating such Offering Period as a fully effective and
completed Offering Period for all purposes under the Purchase Plan); (E) any
fractional shares of Company Common Stock that would result from the
application of subsection (D) will be settled in cash promptly (and in any
event within five (5) Business Days) following the Offer Closing; and (F) the
Purchase Plan shall terminate, effective upon the earlier of the Offering
Termination Date for the Offering Period in effect on the date of this
Agreement and the Offer Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Parent or Merger Sub shall ensure that the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, has an amount in cash at least equal to the
aggregate amount of any cash consideration to be paid to holders of Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 3.3, and the Company or the Surviving

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Corporation, as applicable, shall cause such consideration to be paid to such
holders in accordance with this Section 3.3, without interest and net of such
amounts as the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over by any Person pursuant to this Section 3.3 to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person entitled to payment under
this Section 3.3 in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by a Person pursuant to this Section 3.3.

  

  

Section 3.4 Dissenter Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (a
"Dissenting Stockholder") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares"
means any shares of Company Common Stock as to which a Dissenting Stockholder
thereof has properly exercised a demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to any Merger
Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder's right to seek appraisal of its Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and
any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares
owned by such Dissenting Stockholder and not any Merger Consideration. If any
Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed properly to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to seek appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement if
conditions to payment are met. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the
Company relating to stockholders' demands for appraisal and (b) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") (which Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in
the Company Disclosure Schedule relates; provided, however, that any
information set forth in one Section or subsection of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection thereof
or hereof to which its relevance is readily apparent on its face), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

  

Section 4.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated and validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Subsidiary of the Company is a
corporation, limited liability company or other entity duly incorporated or
formed, validly existing and in good standing (in the jurisdictions that
recognize the concept of good standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation or formation, as the case may be, except where the failure
to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expect to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority and
possesses all governmental licenses, franchises, permits, authorizations and
approvals necessary to enable it to use its corporate or other name and to
own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and
to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to
have such power or authority or possess such governmental licenses,
franchises, permits, authorizations or approvals, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing (in jurisdictions that recognize the
concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent, prior to the execution of
this Agreement, complete and accurate copies of the Company Charter and the
bylaws of the Company (the "Company Bylaws"), and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date hereof.

  

  

Section 4.2 Subsidiaries. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
each Subsidiary of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary, the jurisdiction
of incorporation or formation. All issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,
encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, "Liens") other than those described in clause (vii) of the
definition of Permitted Liens, and free of any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity
interests. Except for the capital stock of, or voting securities or equity
interests in, its Subsidiaries or as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock of, or other voting securities or equity interests in, any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture,
association or other entity.

documents required to be provided in clauses (ii) through (iv).

  

  

(c) Each Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in
material compliance with its terms and in material compliance with all
applicable Laws. With respect to any Employee Plan covered by Subtitle B, Part
4 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, no non-exempt prohibited
transaction has occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected to
cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material liability
under ERISA or the Code.

  

  

(d) Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS or
has applied to the IRS for such a letter within the applicable remedial
amendment period or such period has not expired and, to the Company's
Knowledge, no circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result
in any such letter being revoked or not being reissued or a penalty under the
IRS Closing Agreement Program if discovered during an IRS audit or
investigation. Each trust created thereunder has been determined by the IRS to
be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code.

  

  

(e) Except as set forth on Section 4.16(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

amended ("ERISA"), or which together with the Company is treated as a single

currently has, or in the past six (6) years had, an obligation to contribute
to a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension
plan subject to the funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412
of the Code or a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or
Section 414(f) of the Code and (ii) no liability under Title IV or Section 302
of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not
been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that could reasonably be
expected to present a material risk to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of
incurring any such liability.

  

  

(f) With respect to each group health plan benefiting any current or former
employee of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that is subject to Section
4980B of the Code, the Company and each ERISA Affiliate has complied in all

or medical benefits, beyond termination of service or retirement other than
(i) coverage

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

mandated by law or (ii) death or retirement benefits under any Employee Plan
that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

  

  

(i) Except as set forth in Section 4.16(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together with any
other event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to any
payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement or
job security payment or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable
or trigger any other obligation under, any Employee Plan or (iii) limit or
restrict the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the
Offer Closing, Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any Employee Plan. No
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together
with any other event) by any employee, officer or director of the Company or
any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1) under any employment,
severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement or Employee
Plan currently in effect would reasonably be expected to be characterized as
an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code).

  

  

(j) Each Employee Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code is in documentary compliance with, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have, since January 1, 2009, complied in practice and operation
with, all applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify
or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service Provider for any Tax
incurred by such Service Provider, including under Section 409A or 4999 of the
Code, or any interest or penalty related thereto.

  

  

(k) Each International Plan (i) has been maintained in material compliance
with its terms and applicable Laws, (ii) if intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such treatment and (iii) if
required, to any extent, to be funded, book-reserved or secured by an
insurance policy, is fully funded, book-reserved or secured by an insurance
policy, as applicable, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions in accordance
with applicable accounting principles.

market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant of such
Company Stock Option.

  

  

(m) Sections 4.3, 4.5 \- 4.12, 4.17, 4.18, and 4.21 and this Section 4.16

representative body for the Company to enter into this Agreement or to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the Company
and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with their

results in an effective Tax rate lower than the statutory Tax rate with any
Taxing authority with regard to the Tax liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries affecting any Tax period for which the applicable statute of
limitations, after giving effect to extensions or waivers, has not expired.

  

  

(d) No audit, claim, action, suit or investigation or other proceeding with
respect to any Taxes due from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any Tax
asset or any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is pending

Person.

"listed transaction" within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4. The Company has disclosed on its United States federal income Tax
Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of United States federal income Tax within the meaning of
Section 6662 of the Code or any similar provision of applicable Law in any
non-U.S. jurisdiction.

  

  

(j) No jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file
a Tax Return has made a claim in writing that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is required to file a Tax Return for such jurisdiction.

(e) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not

Intellectual Property Rights, to execute confidentiality agreements with
respect to the confidentiality and use of such trade secrets and other
confidential Intellectual Property Rights developed for or obtained from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in each case, for any failures to
use commercially reasonable efforts, to take commercially reasonable steps, or
to obtain any such agreements that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No trade secrets or
other confidential Intellectual Property Rights of the Company or its

created by a third party (including any current or former employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has
a written agreement with such third party with respect thereto, and the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries thereby either (i) has obtained ownership
of and is the exclusive owner of or (ii) has obtained a valid and unrestricted
right to exploit, sufficient for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted and as proposed to be conducted in the Filed Company SEC Documents,

including but not limited to the implementation of commercially reasonable (A)
data backup, (B) disaster avoidance and recovery procedures and (C) business
continuity procedures, in each case consistent with industry practices. For

concept of good standing) in which the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification
necessary and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
incorporated, validly existing or in good standing, or to have such power or

delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.2 Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other applicable Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally or by equitable
principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought at law or in equity).

  

  

Section 5.3 Non-Contravention. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with the provisions of this
Agreement will not, conflict with, require any payment to or consent or other
action by any Person, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of, or result in, termination, cancellation or acceleration or other
change of any right or obligation or to the loss of a benefit under, or result
in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties or

consummation by Parent of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents (and none of the information

knowingly facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or any inquiries or offers or the
making of any proposal or any other efforts or attempt that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise knowingly participate in any communications or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or

direct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing communications and negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal and shall request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in

contrary, if, at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the Company, in response
to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal received after the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

date hereof and provided, that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) that (A) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) failure to
respond to such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and which
Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2(a), may,
and may permit and authorize its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates'
Representatives to, in each case subject to compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement, (I) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives and financing sources) pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
which contains terms with respect to the maintenance of confidentiality and
restrictions on use of Company information that are no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill
provision) and (II) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Takeover Proposal; provided, that the Company shall concurrently provide or
make available to Parent any information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to such third party which was not previously provided to
Parent, and the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing clause (I) or (II) unless it shall have delivered to Parent a prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action. In
addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
forty-eight (48) hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Takeover Proposal or any request for information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any third party with respect to a Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall (i) provide the identity of the third party making any such
Takeover Proposal, indication or request (to the extent disclosure of the

confidentiality obligations to third parties in effect prior to the date
hereof) and the terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal, indication
or request, (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt and
timely basis, of the status and details of any such Takeover Proposal,
indication or request and (iii) promptly (but in no event later than forty-
eight (48) hours after receipt) advise Parent of any changes to the material
terms of such Takeover Proposal, indication or request.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Takeover Proposal" means any
proposal, inquiry or offer (whether or not in writing) from any Person (other
than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) with respect to, in a
single transaction or series of transactions, any (i) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, other business combination or similar transaction involving
the Company, (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or
indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or
other equity interests in a Subsidiary of the Company or otherwise), of any
business or asset or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
representing 20% or more of the consolidated net income, revenues or assets
(whether determined by reference to book value or fair market value) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders or
owners of any Person) or "group" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the

securities

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) or any interest in such
securities representing 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or of the voting power of the Company's capital stock, (iv)
transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall
acquire, directly or indirectly, Beneficial Ownership, or the right to acquire
Beneficial Ownership, or formation of any "group" (as defined under Section

Beneficial Ownership of, 20% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or of the voting power of the Company's capital stock or (v)
combination of the foregoing.

  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona
fide written offer, which was not solicited after the date hereof and did not
result from a breach of Section 6.2(a), made by any Person (other than Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates) that, if consummated, would result
in such Person (or in the case of a direct merger between such Person and the
Company, the stockholders of such Person) acquiring, directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or of the
voting power of the Company's capital stock or all or substantially all the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer
the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) (i)
provides a higher value from a financial point of view to the stockholders of
the Company than the consideration payable in the Offer and the Merger (taking
into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement, as well as any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(d)), (ii) is reasonably likely to be
completed in a timely fashion, taking into account the conditionality and
likelihood of consummation and all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal and (iii) if a cash transaction (whether in whole or
in part), for which the consideration is fully committed or reasonably
determined by the Board of Directors of the Company to be available.

  

  

(b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw (or not continue to make), change, qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Recommendation or any
approval or recommendation by any such committee regarding this Agreement, the
Offer and the Merger, or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend any Takeover Proposal, or resolve or agree to take any such
action, (ii) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9,
(iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
permit the Company or any of its Affiliates to enter into, any letter of

partnership agreement or other agreement constituting or related to, or which
is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Takeover Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance with Section 6.2(a)),
(iv) fail to enforce or grant any waiver or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless the Board of Directors of the
Company determines after consulting with its outside legal counsel that the
failure to waive such provision would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law; provided, that the Company shall not enforce and
hereby waives any provision of any such agreement that would prohibit a third
party from communicating

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

confidentially an Acquisition Proposal to the Company's Board of Directors or
(v) approve any transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested
stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL (any such action or resolution or
agreement to take such action in clauses (i) - (ii) above being referred to
herein as an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). It is agreed that any violation
of the restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section 6.2 by any
officer or director of the Company (or any other Representative of the Company
that is authorized, intentionally sanctioned or intentionally caused by the
Company) shall be deemed a breach of this Section 6.2 by the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
but subject to Section 6.2(d), at any time prior to the Offer Closing, the
Board of Directors of the Company may, following receipt of a Superior
Proposal received after the date hereof and after determining in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (A) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(h) in order to enter into a binding
agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; provided, that immediately
before and as a condition to any such termination, the Company pays to Parent
the fee required by Section 9.3(b).

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but subject to
Section 6.2(d), the Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior
to the Offer Closing, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change for a reason
unrelated to a Takeover Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
Adverse Recommendation Change proposed to be made in relation to a Takeover
Proposal may only be made pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
Section 6.2(a) and (b)) if the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of material facts, events or circumstances that have developed
since the date of this Agreement that were not known or reasonably foreseeable
to the Company prior to the date hereof, the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Board of Directors of
the Company to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law.

  

  

(d) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.2(c) (or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(h)), unless (i) if such
Adverse Recommendation Change is to be made in relation to a Takeover
Proposal, such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the
Company promptly provides written notice to Parent at least four (4) Business
Days before taking such action of its intention to do so and containing (1) in
the case of any action intended to be taken in relation to a Takeover
Proposal, the material terms of such Takeover Proposal, including the most
current version of the proposed agreement under which such Takeover Proposal
is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Person making the
Takeover Proposal (to the extent disclosure of the identity of such third
party is not otherwise prohibited by the Company's confidentiality obligations
to third parties in effect prior to the date hereof) or (2) in the case of any
action intended to be taken in circumstances not involving or relating to a
Takeover Proposal, a reasonably detailed description of the underlying facts
giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action and (iii) Parent does
not make, within four (4) Business Days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that (1) in the case of any action intended to be taken
in relation to a Takeover Proposal causes the Takeover Proposal, as

determined by the Company's Board of Directors in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, to no
longer constitute a Superior Proposal, or (2) in the case of any action
intended to be taken in circumstances not involving or relating to a Takeover
Proposal, obviates, in the good faith view of the Company's Board of
Directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the need for
such Adverse Recommendation Change. It is understood that in the case of any
action intended to be taken in relation to a Takeover Proposal, any amendment
to the financial terms or other material terms of such Takeover Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company under this Section 6.2(d),
except that the Company's advance written notice obligation shall be reduced
to forty-eight (48) hours (rather than the four (4) Business Days otherwise
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence). The Company agrees that,
during any four (4)-Business Day or forty-eight (48)-hour period, as
applicable, referred to in this Section 6.2(d), the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions proposed by Parent to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 (including Item 1012(a) of
Regulation MA promulgated under the Exchange Act) and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel), (A) failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
or (B) such disclosure is required under the federal securities Laws;
provided, however, that the taking of any such position or making of any such
disclosure or statement (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or
similar communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act)
shall be subject to and only taken in compliance with Section 6.2(b), Section
6.2(c) and Section 6.2(d), as applicable.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit the Company from
responding to any unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the
Person making such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 6.2.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 7.1 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to Parent's Representatives reasonable
access upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours to all
their respective properties, assets, books, records, Contracts, Permits,
documents, information, directors, officers and employees, but only to the
extent that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Parent any information
concerning its business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request, including
information concerning the Company's compliance with its obligations under
clause (A) of Section 6.1(a) related to the development of subcutaneous and
low-volume intravenous formulations of Cinryze (and the Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis, and consider in good
faith Parent's views, with respect thereto); provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

any of its Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such information to
the extent that doing so is restricted under applicable Law or otherwise would
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided, that the Company
shall use its reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege) or is
restricted pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or
arrangement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party (which
such person shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
counterparty thereto to waive) and provided, further, that any such access or
disclosure shall be conducted at Parent's expense during normal business hours
and shall be subject to supervision by the Company's or the applicable
Subsidiary's personnel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i)
Parent and Merger Sub shall not be permitted prior to the Closing Date to
contact any of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' vendors, customers,
suppliers, contract counterparties, joint venture partners or, other than as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Governmental Entities regarding the
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries without receiving the prior
written consent of the Company, which will not be unreasonably withheld and
(ii) prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall not have the right
to conduct any environmental testing, sampling or analysis at, on, under or
from any real property of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Parent will hold, and will direct its Representatives to hold, any and all
information received from the Company confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.2 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Each party from whom a filing under the HSR Act would be required in order
for the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated lawfully shall, as
promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days)
following the date hereof, file with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") all materials initially required to be filed under the HSR Act in
connection with this transaction ("HSR Filing"). As promptly as practicable
following the date hereof, each party shall make all other filings necessary
or appropriate under any other applicable foreign Competition Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including submitting a
draft application for the approval of the transaction to the UK Office of Fair
Trading ("OFT") no later than two (2) Business Days following the date
hereof). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the parties hereto shall
request expedited treatment of any such filings, furnish to one another such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may require in
connection with its preparation of such filings, and give each other advance
notice of and a meaningful opportunity to review, and take into account each
other's reasonable comments with respect to, such filings. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall voluntarily withdraw its respective HSR Filing without the
prior written consent of the other party. After any filing or submission under
the HSR Act or other Competition Law, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the parties hereto shall keep one another apprised of the status of, and
give each other advance notice of, and a meaningful opportunity to review and
take into account each other's reasonable comments, all communications with,
and all inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity, and shall comply promptly
with any such reasonable inquiry or request. To the extent permitted by the
relevant Governmental Entity, the parties hereto shall give each other advance
notice of and permit each other to attend all in-

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

person or telephonic meetings or conferences between one or more of the
parties hereto and one or more Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or other
Competition Law.

  

  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i)
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit A and
Article VIII, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, clearances, orders and authorizations from, and
the giving of any necessary notices to, Governmental Entities and other
Persons, (iii) the taking of all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental
information requested by a Governmental Entity, including participating in
meetings with officials of such entity in the course of its review of this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate and make effective the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and
its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated hereby under any Competition Law or if any suit is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable
Governmental Entity or any private party, challenging the Offer, the Merger or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Competition
Law, or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as reasonably
practicable; in this context, "reasonable best efforts" shall include, without
limitation, (i) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, that challenge this Agreement, the Offer, or the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby; (ii)
seeking to have lifted, vacated or reversed any stay, injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other restraint entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity; (iii) divesting, disposing of, or transferring any assets
or entities; (iv) granting licenses; (v) entering into hold-separate
agreements; (vi) making commitments as to future conduct or operations; and
(vii) agreeing to do or permitting to be done any of the foregoing; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A)
Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any of the actions
described in the foregoing clauses (iii) through (vii) (insofar as clause
(vii) relates to the foregoing clauses (iii) through (vi)) (x) with respect to
Firazyr or Cinryze (including any alternative low volume formulation of
Cinryze or any formulation utilizing

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

subcutaneous administration) or (y) to the extent that such action or actions
unrelated to Firazyr or Cinryze (including any alternative low volume
formulation of Cinryze or any formulation utilizing subcutaneous
administration) would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to the Company (and its Subsidiaries) and Parent
(and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole (provided, that, for such purposes,
impacts on Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
aggregated) (any such action described in this clause (A), a "Burdensome
Condition") and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor Parent
nor any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be obligated to, and the
Company shall not without Parent's prior written consent, become subject to,
or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any
requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental
Entity to sell, hold separate, divest, dispose of or transfer any assets,
grant any license or conduct or change its business unless such requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order is binding on the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as
the case may be, only in the event the Offer Closing occurs.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall control and lead all communications,
defense, litigation, negotiations and strategy relating to the HSR Act or any
other Competition Law relating to any of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, that, subject to Section 7.2(a), each Party shall be responsible for
and control its HSR Filing, its filing with OFT, if any, and its responses to
Governmental Entities with respect to such filings; and provided, further,
that Parent shall consult with and consider in good faith the comments of the
Company in connection with any such communication, defense, litigation,
negotiation or strategy relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law
and, to the extent reasonably practicable and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, shall give the Company the opportunity to attend and
participate in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person
relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against the
Company and/or its directors, officers, employees, advisors or agents relating
to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to
settling or satisfying, or offering to settle, any such claim, it being
understood and agreed that the Company shall control such defense and that
this Section 7.2(e) shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense,
except to the extent that Parent or Merger Sub is named as a defendant in such
litigation and in that case solely as to the defense of Parent and Merger Sub.

  

  

Section 7.3 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party hereto shall promptly
notify the other party hereto of (a) its discovery of any occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that would be likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; (b) any
written notice or other written communication from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is required in connection with the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (c)
any suits, actions or proceedings commenced or threatened

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

that relate to the consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement of which such
party has Knowledge; and (d) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

  

  

Section 7.4 Director and Officer Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time in favor of both the current and former directors and/or
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are provided in the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective certificates of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights of individuals who were directors,
officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time. Parent and Merger Sub further agree that any indemnification
or other agreements of the Company (as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and such agreements shall not be modified in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights of individuals who were directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, Parent hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the payment and performance obligations of the
Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.4(a).

  

  

(b) From the Offer Closing through the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect the Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance
covering each Person currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
provided, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor
policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii) satisfy its obligation
under this Section 7.4(b) by causing the Company to obtain, on or prior to the
Closing Date, prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy at Parent's expense, in each case, the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable to such directors and
officers than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section
7.4(b); provided, further, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
be required to pay an annual premium (or, in the case of a prepaid policy
obtained pursuant to

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

clause (ii), an aggregate amount) for such insurance in excess of 300% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided,
further, that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any individual who is now, or who has been at
any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company, on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 7.4
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.4 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by Contract or otherwise. Parent shall pay all expenses, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in
this Section 7.4 in connection with their successful enforcement of their
rights provided in Section 7.4.

  

  

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and
assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.4.

  

  

Section 7.5 Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial press
release(s) to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form(s) agreed to by the parties. Except with
respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each
other before making, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements (including
broad-based employee communications) with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such reasonably practicable consultation, except as may be required
by applicable Law, listing authority (including the U.K. listing authority),
court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
U.S. or U.K. securities or share exchange market or securities quotation
system to which such party is subject, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

  

 

  

Section 7.6 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform all of its respective
agreements, covenants and obligations under this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Merger Sub shall not engage in any activities of any nature except as
provided in or contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.7 Section 16(b). The Company shall take all steps reasonably
required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
other dispositions of equity securities of the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 7.8 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Company will not, after the date hereof, enter into,
establish, amend or modify any plan, program, agreement or arrangement
pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which
benefits are provided, in each case to any Company Employee unless, prior to
such entry into, establishment, amendment or modification, the Compensation
Committee shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (a) approve
as an Employment Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement
or arrangement and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such
plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

  

  

Section 7.9 Company Benefit Plan Matters.

  

  

(a) For a period of two (2) years following the Offer Closing (or if shorter,
during the period of employment), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is employed
as of immediately prior to the Offer Closing (collectively, the "Company
Employees"), compensation (including base salary and cash incentive
opportunities, but excluding equity incentive opportunities) and benefits
(including paid time off, defined contribution retirement and welfare
benefits) which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
compensation (including base salary and cash and incentive opportunities, but
excluding equity incentive opportunities) and benefits (including paid time
off, defined contribution retirement and welfare benefits) provided to such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Offer Closing. In addition, if any
Company Employee (other than those who are party to a Change of Control
Agreement with the Company, whose rights shall be governed by the terms of
such agreements) incurs a qualifying termination of employment in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the severance arrangement listed on Section
7.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule within two (2) years following the
Offer Closing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, severance
payments and benefits to such Company Employee in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such severance arrangement (taking into account such Company
Employee's service as required pursuant to Section 7.9(b) below). Following
the two- (2) year period referenced in this Section 7.9(a), each Company
Employee shall be eligible to receive compensation and benefits, including
severance benefits, which are substantially similar to those provided at the
time to then similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit accrual
under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Offer Closing (the "New Plans"),
each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries or predecessors before the Offer Closing, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Offer
Closing, to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan or
the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Offer Closing (and to the
extent there is not a similar employee benefit plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, service as recognized for purposes of the Company's 401(k) plan
as in effect immediately prior to the Offer Closing); provided, that service
of a Company Employee prior to the Offer Closing Date with the Company and its
Subsidiaries or predecessors shall not be recognized for the purpose of any
entitlement to participate in, or receive or accrue benefits with respect to,
any defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical programs or other retiree
welfare benefit programs maintained by Parent or its Affiliates. In addition,
(i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in New Plans that are welfare benefit plans (other
than retiree medical programs or other retiree welfare benefit programs) to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is comparable to an Employee Plan in
which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Offer Closing
(such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans") other than limitations or waiting
periods that would have been in effect with respect to such Company Employee
under the applicable Old Plan immediately prior to the Offer Closing and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Company Employee, (A) Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old
Plan in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Offer
Closing and (B) Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in
the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan. In no event shall anything contained in this
Section 7.9(b) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

  

  

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger constitutes a change of control or change in control, as the case may
be, for all purposes under the Employee Plans.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall take all actions that may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Company's 401(k) Employee Savings Plan
(the "Company 401(k) Plan") to terminate as of the date immediately preceding
the Offer Closing Date. All resolutions, notices or other documents issued,
adopted or executed in connection with such termination shall be subject to
Parent's prior review and comment. As of the Offer Closing Date, Parent shall
have in place a tax qualified defined contribution retirement plan in which
Company Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Offer Closing Date are eligible to participate (the "Parent 401(k) Plan"). The
Parent 401(k) Plan shall permit each such Company Employee with an account
balance in the Company 401(k) Plan to make rollover contributions of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code)
to the Parent 401(k) Plan, in the form of cash or loan promissory notes as
applicable, in an amount equal to all or any portion of the account balance
distributed to such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan.

  

  

(e) To the extent not previously paid by the Company prior to the Offer
Closing, no later than five (5) Business Days following the Offer Closing
Date, the Company shall make a cash payment to each employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries who is a participant in the Company's U.S. Cash Bonus Plan
("Bonus Plan") as of the date hereof, in full satisfaction of each such
employee's rights under such plan, in an amount equal to (i) the amount
determined by the Company prior to the Offer Closing Date to be payable to
such employee with respect to the 2013 calendar year under the Bonus Plan,
based on the Company's performance through the earlier of December 31, 2013
and the Offer Closing Date and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days elapsed in the 2013 calendar year through the Offer Closing and
the denominator of which is 365. To the extent not paid prior to the Offer
Closing, each Company Employee who participates in a cash incentive plan set
forth on Section 7.9(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "2013
Bonus Plan") will be eligible to receive a payment under such 2013 Bonus Plan
for the performance period ending on December 31, 2013, if the Company
Employee remains employed by the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, through the required date set forth in such 2013 Bonus Plan or
if the Company Employee is terminated by the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, without "cause" (as defined in the severance
arrangement listed on Section 7.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule)
following the Offer Closing. In the event the Offer Closing occurs prior to
December 31, 2013, each 2013 Bonus Plan will continue to be maintained in
accordance with the terms thereof through December 31, 2013. Payments under
the 2013 Bonus Plans will in all cases be determined in accordance with the
terms of the 2013 Bonus Plans and the Company\'s historical practices for
making such payments and will reflect a participant's individual targets (as
applicable).

  

  

(f) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent (and their
Affiliates) shall reasonably cooperate and use good faith efforts in all
matters reasonably necessary to effect this Section 7.9, including (i)
exchanging information and data relating to employee benefits and employee
benefit plan coverages (except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law) and
(ii) making any and all required communications with Company Employees.

  

  

(g) Nothing in this Section 7.9 shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan. The provisions of this Section 7.9 are
solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and,
without limiting the generality of Section 10.7 nothing in this Section 7.9,
express or implied, shall confer upon any Company Employee, or legal
representative or beneficiary thereof or any other Person, any rights or
remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment for any

terminating party specifying the subsection of this Section 9.1 pursuant to
which such termination is effected):

  

  

(a) subject to Section 1.3, by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

  

  

(i) the Offer Closing shall not have occurred prior to August 12, 2014 (the
"Termination Date") for any reason; provided, however, that if, as of the
Termination Date, one or more of the conditions set forth in clause (ii) or

and provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

proviso) shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement has resulted in the failure of the Offer
Closing to occur prior to such date;

  

  

(ii) any Legal Restraint (other than a temporary restraining order) that has
the effect of preventing the consummation of the Offer or the Merger shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however,

effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(iii) shall not
be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement has resulted in such Legal Restraint being or remaining
in effect;

  

  

(c) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent, in the event an Adverse

(d) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent, if the Company shall have

in any material respect any of its representations or warranties or failed to
perform in any material respect any of its obligations, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (d) or
(e) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the
Company by the Termination Date or, if capable of being cured by the Company
by the Termination Date, the Company does not commence to cure such breach or
failure within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of written notice
thereof from Parent and cure such breach or failure within thirty (30) days

or failure within thirty (30) days after their receipt of written notice
thereof from the Company and (ii) in any way would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation by Parent or
Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement;

  

  

(g) prior to the Offer Closing, by Parent or the Company, if the Offer has
expired in accordance with its terms and has not been extended by Merger Sub,

and not validly withdrawn (provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(g) shall not be available to Parent if Parent
or Merger Sub is then in breach of its obligation hereunder to accept such
shares for payment); and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) prior to the Offer Closing, by the Company in accordance with the terms
and subject to the conditions of Section 6.2(b) and Section 6.2(d).

  

  

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or

termination and (b) the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve or
release any party hereto from any liability arising out of its willful breach
(subject to Section 9.3(e)) of this Agreement or any fraud.

  

  

Section 9.3 Fees and Expenses.

  

  

(a) Except as expressly set forth in this Section 9.3, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party

consummated.

  

  

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.1(c) or Section 9.1(d) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section

termination by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c) or Section 9.1(d), within two
(2) Business Days after such termination and (y) in the case of a termination
by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(h), immediately before and as a
condition to such termination.

  

  

(c) In the event that (i) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any
Takeover Proposal (for purposes of this Section 9.3(c), substituting 50% for
the 20% thresholds set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal) is
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Board
of Directors of the Company and not publicly and unconditionally withdrawn,
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(b)(i) or Section 9.1(g) (unless Parent or Merger Sub was, at the time of a

termination of this Agreement, (A) the Company enters into any acquisition
agreement or other definitive agreement or Contract providing for, or the
Board of Directors recommends to the Company's stockholders, any Takeover

Proposal referred to in clause (i)) or (B) a transaction in respect of any
Takeover Proposal shall have been consummated (regardless of whether such
Takeover Proposal is the same Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (i)),
then the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee upon the occurrence
of the applicable event described in clause (iii)(A) or (B).

  

  

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(b) and, at the
time of such termination, (A) one or more of the conditions set forth in
clause (ii) or paragraph (a) or (b) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A shall not
have been satisfied or waived solely as a result of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

applicable Competition Law or any Burdensome Condition and (B) all of the
other conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of Exhibit A have been
satisfied or waived (or in the case of conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, would be satisfied if the Offer Closing were to
occur on the date of such termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company
in immediately available funds $200,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee")
immediately before, and as a condition to, any such termination by Parent and
otherwise as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) following such termination; provided, that no Reverse
Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) if
the Company's failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement
has materially contributed to the failure of the conditions set forth in
clause (ii) or paragraph (a) or (b) of clause (iii) of Exhibit A to be
satisfied.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including in
Section 9.2, Section 10.7(b) and Section 10.12), the parties agree that (i)
the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement in the event
the Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms of this Agreement,
and, upon payment of the Termination Fee, the Company shall have no further
liability to Parent and Merger Sub hereunder and (ii) the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to
the Company with respect to this Agreement in the event the Reverse
Termination Fee becomes due and payable under the terms of this Agreement,
and, upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, Parent and Merger Sub shall
have no further liability to the Company hereunder.

upon or otherwise been induced by, any other express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to the Company or with respect to any information
made available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company makes no representations and
warranties except as set forth in Article IV. Moreover, except in the case of
fraud or intentional misconduct, (x) neither the Company, the Company's
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
affiliates, agents or Representatives nor any other Person will have or be
subject to any liability or obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent's or
Merger Sub's use of, any such information, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
or Merger Sub in the data rooms or management presentations in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless any such information
is included or incorporated in a representation or warranty contained in
Article IV, and (y) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any other

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Person makes any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to any
projections or forecasts that may have been provided to Parent or any of its
Representatives.

  

  

Section 10.2 Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. This
Section 10.2 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which by
its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and
the provisions of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all
information and material delivered by any party hereunder.

  

  

Section 10.3 Amendment. Subject to Section 1.3, this Agreement may be amended
by the parties hereto at any time, whether before or after the Offer Closing
shall have occurred, provided, however, that after the Offer Closing, there
shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger Consideration and there shall
be made no amendment that by Law requires approval by stockholders of the
Company without approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

  

  

Section 10.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that there shall
be made no waiver that by Law requires approval by stockholders of the Company
without the approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party which specifically sets
forth the terms of such extension or waiver. The failure or delay by any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or
partial exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under
this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any
other rights under this Agreement.

counterparts (including by facsimile or pdf), all of which shall be considered
one and the same

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  

  

agreement and shall become effective when one or more such counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

Section 10.7 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
together with the Exhibits and Appendix hereto, the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, constitutes the entire agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, except
for the Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
(and their respective successors and assigns) any rights (legal, equitable or
otherwise) or remedies, whether as third-party beneficiaries or otherwise,
except (a) for the third-party beneficiaries contemplated by Section 7.4, (b)
that, subject to Section 9.3(e), the Company shall have the right to pursue
damages on behalf of its stockholders (which the parties acknowledge and agree
may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by such
stockholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including other
combination opportunities and the time value of money)) in the event of
Parent's or Merger Sub's fraud or willful breach of this Agreement, which
right is hereby acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub, and (c) from and after
the Effective Time, holders of shares of the Company Common Stock shall have
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Article III.

  

  

Section 10.8 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part,
whether by merger, operation of Law or otherwise, by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company without the prior written consent of the other parties except that
Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of
its Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person;
provided, that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of
any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Sub. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

  

  

Section 10.9 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Laws
thereof or that would cause the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware to apply.

  

  

Section 10.10 Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Venue.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction
in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware) for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees that no such
action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it
or any of its Subsidiaries except in such courts).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.5 shall
be deemed effective service of process on such party.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and
agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery (and if
jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, the
federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware) or that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Parent waives any right to
assert sovereign immunity or any similar defense available to it by virtue of
its domicile in Ireland.

  

  

Section 10.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each
party hereto (a) certifies that no Representative of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event
of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and
(b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to
enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 10.11.

  

  

Section 10.12 Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Delaware Court
of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
State of Delaware), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that the party seeking such injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. In the event that any party seeks an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such injunction or other
Judgment.

  

  

Section 10.13 Consents and Approvals. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing and executed and
delivered to the other parties by a Person duly authorized by such party to do
so.

application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

  

Section 10.15 Joint and Several Liability; Obligation of Parent. Parent and
Merger Sub hereby agree that they will be jointly and severally liable for all
covenants, agreements, obligations and representations and warranties made by
either of them in this Agreement. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub
to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such action and a guarantee
of the payment and performance thereof.

  

  

Section 10.16 Parent Holdco Guarantee.

  

  

(a) Parent Holdco irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Company
the due and punctual performance of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
hereunder (the "Guaranteed Obligations") subject to the conditions hereunder.
If, for any reason whatsoever, Parent or Merger Sub shall fail or be unable to
duly, punctually and fully pay or perform the Guaranteed Obligations, Parent
Holdco will forthwith pay or perform, or cause to be paid or performed, the
Guaranteed Obligations. Parent Holdco hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of payment, filing objections with a court, any right to require
proceeding first against Parent or Merger Sub, any right to require the prior
disposition of the assets of Parent or Merger Sub to meet their respective
obligations, notice, protest and all demands whatsoever. This is a guarantee
of payment and performance and not collectability.

  

  

(b) Parent Holdco is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and (to
the extent applicable) in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Parent Holdco has all requisite corporate power and authority
and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent Holdco and is a valid and binding agreement
of Parent Holdco, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors' rights generally
or by principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity). Parent Holdco hereby makes the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 5.7 with respect to
itself. Parent Holdco owns directly one hundred percent (100%) of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of Parent.

  

  

(c) Parent Holdco shall not transfer or assign, in whole or in part, any of
its obligations under this Section 10.16.

Section 11.2 Exhibits, Appendix and Schedules; Interpretation. The headings
contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit, Appendix or Schedule hereto and
in the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any
capitalized terms used in any Schedule, Appendix or Exhibit but not otherwise
defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined in this Agreement. When a
reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Subsection,
Exhibit, Appendix or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section or Article
of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.
For all purposes hereof, the terms "include," "includes" and "including" shall
be deemed followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof,"
"hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The

References to matters disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents are made
without giving effect to any amendment to any such Filed Company SEC Document
filed on or after the date hereof. The mere inclusion of an item in the
Company Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had,
would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not
be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the

shares of Company Common Stock if:

  

  

(i) there shall not be validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date that number of shares of Company Common Stock (excluding
shares tendered pursuant to notices of guaranteed delivery for which shares
have not been delivered) which, when added to the shares of Company Common
Stock already owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, represents at least a
majority of the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as
of the Expiration Date (the "Minimum Tender Condition");

  

  

(ii) any waiting period or review period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the Offer or the Merger under any Competition Law (including
with respect to any HSR Filing and any filing with the OFT) shall not have
been terminated or shall not have expired and any other approval that is
required to consummate the Offer or the Merger under any Competition Law shall
not have been obtained (or any such waiting period or review period shall have
terminated or expired, or any such approval shall have been obtained, subject
to or conditioned upon the imposition of a Burdensome Condition);

  

  

(iii) any of the following events shall exist on the Expiration Date or
immediately prior to the Offer Closing:

  

  

(a) there shall be any Law or Judgment enacted, enforced, amended, issued, in
effect or deemed applicable to the Offer, by any Governmental Entity (other
than the application of the waiting period provisions of any Competition Law
to the Offer or to the Merger) the effect of which is to directly or
indirectly make illegal or otherwise prohibit or materially delay consummation
of the Offer or the Merger;

  

  

(b) there shall exist or be instituted or pending any claim, suit, action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking any of the consequences referred
to in paragraph (a) above or seeking to impose a Burdensome Condition;

(B) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Section 4.4, Section 4.22, Section 4.23, Section 4.24 or in the first sentence
of Section 4.1 that are qualified as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect

any such representations or warranties that are not so qualified shall not be
true and correct in any material respect or (C) the representations and
warranties of the Company in set forth Section 4.10(c) shall not be true and
correct in all respects, in each case as of the date of the Agreement and at
all times prior to the Offer Closing as if made at and as of such time, except
to the extent such representations and warranties relate to an earlier time
(in which case on and as of such earlier time);

  

  

(2) any representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the
Agreement (other than those listed in the preceding clause (1)) shall not be
true and correct as of the date of the Agreement and at all times prior to the
Offer Closing as if made at and as of such time, except to the extent such
representations and warranties relate to an earlier time (in which case on and
as of such earlier time), except in the case of this clause (2) to the extent
that the facts or matters as to which such representations and warranties are
not so true and correct (without giving effect to any qualifications and
limitations as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein), individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

  

  

(e) the Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed by it under the
Agreement and such failure to perform shall not have been cured;

  

  

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall not have received a certificate executed by a
duly authorized officer of the Company dated as of the Expiration Date
confirming on behalf of the Company that the conditions set forth in clauses
(c), (d) and (e) of paragraph (iii) of this Exhibit A are duly satisfied
immediately prior to the Offer Closing;

  

  

(g) the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement or agreement in
principal with any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to a
Takeover Proposal; or

  

  

(h) the Company Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse Recommendation
Change; or

  

  

(iv) the Company and Parent shall have reached an agreement that the Offer or
the Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in

pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.

  

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
(including any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, provided, that
nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from any obligation or liability
such party has under the Agreement) giving rise to any such

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

EXHIBIT A-2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

conditions and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time in their sole discretion (except for the
Minimum Tender Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
