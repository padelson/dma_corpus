(j) any Tax refund or reimbursement due to Sellers or their Affiliates;

 



 

(k) all amounts owed to either Seller by any one or more of such Sellers
Affiliates (including the other Seller), including all amounts owed to either
Seller by the Cagle Trusts;

 



 

(l) any shares of stock or other equity interests in any of Sellers;

 



 

(m) all other assets listed on _Schedule 2.2(m)_.

pursuant thereto or in connection therewith;

 



 

(o) all rights of Sellers in or under the Pension Plan;

 



 

(p) all Accounts Receivable not included in the Acquired Accounts Receivable;
and

 



 

(q) all assets, properties and/or rights of Sellers not otherwise specifically
included in the Purchased Assets.

 



 

2.3 _Assumed Liabilities_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, Purchaser agrees, effective at the time of the Closing, to
assume, pay, perform and discharge, promptly when payment or performance is
due or required, the following liabilities and obligations of Sellers or the
Business (the " _Assumed Liabilities_ "):

 



 

(a) all accounts payable and other trade payables incurred by Sellers after
the Petition Date that remain unpaid as of the Closing (the " _Post-Petition
Payables_ ");

 



 

(b) all costs, expenses and liabilities pro-rated to Purchaser as set forth in
this Agreement (including _Section 8.3_);

 



 

(c) all accrued expenses of Sellers that remain unpaid as of the Closing, but
only in the categories set forth on the Statement of Current Assumed
Liabilities attached to the Balance Sheet (the " _Accrued Expenses_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , the Accrued Expenses shall in no event include: (i)
the obligations and liabilities assigned to Sellers pursuant to _Section
9.4_; and (ii) any pre- or post-Closing obligations and liabilities relating
to or arising under the Pension Plan in any amount; and

 



 

(d) as contemplated by _Section 8.2_, all Transfer Taxes.

 



 

2.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser is assuming only the Assumed Liabilities
and is not assuming any other Claim or Lien against or obligation of Sellers
of whatever nature, whether presently in existence or arising hereafter. All
such other Claims, Liens, and obligations shall be retained by and remain
obligations and liabilities of Sellers, including ERISA/workers compensation
and accrued group insurance claims, products liability and personal injury
claims (all such liabilities and obligations not being assumed being herein
referred to as the " _Excluded Liabilities_ ").

 



 

2.5 _Assumption/Assignment of Contracts and Rights_. Sellers have set forth on
_Schedule 2.5(i)_ hereto a list of all of their executory contracts and
unexpired leases as of the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
Sellers have included on _Schedule 2.5(i)_ hereto executory contracts and
unexpired leases that are Post-Petition Contracts entered into on or prior to
the date of this Agreement. Except as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_, at the
Closing, Sellers shall assume and assign to Purchaser, pursuant to Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, those specific executory contracts and unexpired
leases shown on _Schedule 2.5(ii)_ (the " _Material Assumed_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Contracts_ ") and such other executory contracts and unexpired leases which
Purchaser designates by notification in writing (collectively with the
Material Assumed Contracts, the " _Assumed Contracts_ "), received by the
Sellers not less than five (5) days prior to the Auction. Sellers shall have
sole responsibility for paying (or causing to be paid) all Cure Costs due in
connection with the assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset that
is not a Material Assumed Contract or any right thereunder if an attempted
assignment, without the consent of a third party, would constitute a breach or
in any way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser or Sellers thereunder. If
such consent is not obtained or such assignment is not permitted or otherwise
attainable pursuant to Sections 105, 363 and/or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or
pursuant to the terms of the Approval Order regarding any Assumed Contract
that is not a Material Assumed Contract, then such Purchased Asset shall not
be transferred hereunder and the Closing shall proceed with respect to the
remaining Purchased Assets without any reduction in the Purchase Price. Unless
otherwise agreed to by Purchaser in writing, (i) no executory contract or
unexpired lease of Sellers that is not an Assumed Contract shall be assumed
and assigned by Sellers to Purchaser and (ii) Purchaser shall have no
liability for any executory contract or unexpired lease that is not an Assumed
Contract.

 



 

2.6 _Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price._

 



 

(a) The purchase price for the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets ("
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be in U.S. dollars and shall be (i) Thirty-Seven
Million Dollars ($37,000,000.00), plus (ii) the Inventory Value (as determined
in _Section 2.7(a)_ below) and the Book Value of the Acquired Accounts
Receivable of Sellers, minus (iii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Post-
Petition Payables and the Accrued Expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , the Post-
Petition Payables and Accrued Expenses shall be calculated and determined in
the same manner as the Statement of Current Assumed Liabilities attached to
the Balance Sheet.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver the Purchase Price as follows: (i)
the lesser of Fifty-Five Million Dollars ($55,000,000.00) or the Purchase
Price, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds to a
bank account (or accounts) as shall be designated in writing no later than one
(1) day prior to the Closing Date by First American Title Insurance Company ("
_Disbursement Agent_ "), for further disbursement by Disbursement Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, which amount shall be
reduced by the amount of the Good Faith Deposit paid to Sellers as a credit
against the Purchase Price in accordance with _Section 2.8(b);_ and (ii) if
the Purchase Price exceeds Fifty-Five Million Dollars, such excess shall be
evidenced by a promissory note in the original principal amount of such
excess, bearing interest at 8% per annum, payable in eight (8) equal quarterly
installments of principal (plus accrued interest to the date of each payment),
with no prepayment penalties. Notwithstanding the due dates described in the
previous sentence, for any quarterly installments that are otherwise due and
payable during the calendar year 2012 and during the month of January 2013,
payment of such quarterly installments shall be deferred until February 1,
2013, whereupon all such deferred payments (with interest accrued thereon)
shall be due and payable. The remaining quarterly installments shall continue
and shall be due and payable commencing with the then next regularly-scheduled
quarterly installment then due on or following February 1, 2013. Said
remaining quarterly installments shall be payable on the first (1st) day of
the calendar month of the applicable quarter. _By way of example_ , if Closing
occurs in May 2012, then

 



      
 

 



 

quarterly installments would otherwise be due September 1, 2012 (deferred to
February 1, 2013 as described above), December 1, 2012 (deferred to February
1, 2013 as described above), March 1, 2013, June 1, 2013, September 1, 2013,
December 1, 2013, March 1, 2014, with the remainder of principal and accrued
interest then due and payable (in full) on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Purchase Note"). The Purchase Note shall be governed in
accordance with Georgia law and shall be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Guaranty.

 



 

(c) Purchaser and Sellers agree that the Purchase Price and applicable Assumed
Liabilities shall be allocated in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and
the regulations thereunder and _Schedule 2.6(c)_ hereof (such schedule to be
determined jointly by Purchaser and Sellers prior to Closing). Each of
Purchaser and Sellers agrees to provide the other promptly with any other
information required to complete _Schedule 2.6(c)_. Such allocation shall be
binding on Purchaser and Sellers for all purposes, including the reporting of
gain or loss and determination of basis for income tax purposes, and each of
the parties hereto agrees that it will file a statement (on IRS Form 8594 or
other applicable form) setting forth such allocation with its federal and
applicable state income tax returns and will also file such further
information or take such further actions as may be necessary to comply with
the Treasury Regulations that have been promulgated pursuant to Section 1060
of the Code and similar applicable state Laws and regulations.

 



 

2.7 _Inventory and Accounts Receivable_.

 



 

(a) _Inventory Value_. On the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide to Purchaser
a listing of each category of Inventory items, including broiler Inventory,
pullets, breeders, eggs, feed ingredients and finished goods and supplies,
packing materials and ingredients and the quantity of each such category as of
the Closing Date. With respect to the calculation of the value of the
Inventory, the Parties agree that on the day after the Closing Date,
Purchasers employees and those employees selected by Sellers (whether or not
such employees are Transferred Employees), supervised by Frost, PLLC (at
Sellers expense), shall take a physical count of each category of Inventory
(including broiler inventory, pullets, breeders, eggs, feed ingredients,
finished feed, supplies, parts, and packaging materials) and determine the
physical count of each such category as of the Closing Date. Except as
provided below in this _Section 2.7_, each category of Inventory shall be
valued as of the Closing Date at the lower of Sellers cost thereof in
accordance with GAAP on a first-in/first-out and category-by-category basis
consistent with Sellers past practices or market. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the calculation of "Inventory Value" as
determined pursuant to _Section 2.7_ shall not include any Inventories that
are obsolete, damaged, spoiled or unusable. In determining the value of each
Inventory category, the Sellers cost of each Inventory category computed on a
first-in/first-out basis shall include only the following costs with respect
to each Inventory category:

 



 

(i) _Pullet Inventory_. The value of the pullet Inventory shall be based upon
the actual costs incurred from placement to capitalization, including pullet
chick cost from the primary breeder, cost of feed delivered to the pullet
houses, grower compensation paid to the pullet growers, cost of servicing, and
cost of medication and vaccination.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Breeder Inventory_. The value of the breeder Inventory shall be based
upon the cost of the flock transferred from the pullet farm less the
applicable amortization of the capitalized costs of the flock over a thirty-
seven (37) week useful life to include the residual value of the spent hens,
plus the unconsumed feed on the breeder farms, the value of any undelivered
eggs on the breeder farms, and the cost of servicing.

 



 

(iii) _Egg Inventory_. The value of the egg Inventory shall be determined by
taking into consideration the actual egg cost from the breeder, plus the
delivery cost of transporting the egg inventory to the hatchery. The actual
egg cost shall include breeder flock amortization expense, cost of feed fed to
the flock, grower compensation, hen servicing costs, cost of sanitation
supplies, and all other non-administrative hatchery costs.

 



 

(iv) _Broiler Inventory_. The value of the broiler Inventory shall include the
costs of the chicks from the hatchery, delivery cost to the farm, finished
feed costs delivered to the farm, and medications, veterinary and vaccination
costs.

 



 

(v) _Feed Ingredient Inventory_. The value of the feed ingredient Inventory
shall be the actual cost of the feed ingredient delivered at the mill,
including with respect to feed ingredient Inventory that has been prepaid by
Sellers and is delivered from and after the Closing.

 



 

(vi) _Finished Feed Inventory_. The value of the finished feed Inventory shall
be the cost of the feed ingredient and the cost of milling.

 



 

(vii) _Finished Goods Inventory_. The finished goods Inventory shall be valued
on a category by category basis at the lower of Sellers cost or market;
market shall be defined as the Sellers selling price of such category of
finished goods Inventory, net of freight costs to deliver, marketing programs,
rebates, broker commissions (but only to the extent that such marketing
programs, rebates and broker commissions relate to finished goods inventory
produced or packaged for a specific customer that Purchaser could not easily
repackage and sell to another customer without incurring additional
significant costs), and outside cold storage costs to arrive at a f.o.b. the
plant net selling price; this market price will be based on the most recent
sales prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , the market price of
poultry leg quarters shall be the current negotiated export price, less the
cost of any additional freight and cold storage expense to be incurred to move
the product to port.

 



 

(viii) _Miscellaneous Inventory_. The miscellaneous Inventory shall include
supplies, parts, packing materials, labels, boxes, ingredients and crates,
whether or not reflected on the Balance Sheet or in Sellers books of account,
and shall be valued at Sellers cost, except packaging inventory, including
boxes and labels, shall be valued at 60 cents on the dollar of the cost of
such items.

 



      
 

 



 

The aggregate value of the Inventory Items calculated in accordance with
_Section 2.7(a)(i) through (viii)_ shall constitute the " _Inventory Value_ "
to be used in determining the Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) _Accounts Receivable_. At the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to the
Purchaser a full and complete, aged list of all of Sellers Acquired Accounts
Receivable (excluding all intercompany accounts receivable) as of the Closing
appearing on the books of account of the Sellers, together with marketing
programs, rebates, other discounts and set offs associated therewith. The
"Book Value" of the Acquired Accounts Receivable **** shall be the value of
the Acquired Accounts Receivable appearing on the books of account of the
Sellers reduced by any rebates, discounts or set offs associated with any
marketing programs that are not otherwise reflected or taken into
consideration in the Post-Petition Payables or Accrued Expenses. The Purchaser
will accept all Acquired Accounts Receivable and use its good faith,
reasonable best efforts to collect such Acquired Accounts Receivable until
sixty (60) days after the Closing (the " _A/R Collection Deadline_ "). On the
A/R Collection Deadline, (i) title to any uncollected Closing Date Acquired
Accounts Receivable shall revert and be transferred to Sellers, and (ii)
Purchaser shall provide to Sellers true, correct and complete books and
records reflecting the collection of Acquired Accounts Receivable during such
60-day period. The difference between the collected Acquired Accounts
Receivable and the aggregate amount of Closing Date Acquired Accounts
Receivable shall be considered a deficiency, and the principal amount of the
Purchase Note shall be reduced by an amount equal to such deficiency (such
reduction being applied to principal payments in reverse order of payment).

 



 

2.8 _Good Faith Deposit_.

 



 

(a) Within three (3) Business Days following the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall deposit with First American Title Insurance Company (" _Escrow
Agent_ ") cash in immediately available federal funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by Escrow Agent, in an amount equal to Four Million and
No/100 Dollars ($4,000,000.00) (the " _Good Faith Deposit_ "), to be applied
as provided in Section 2.8(b). The Good Faith Deposit shall be held in escrow
by Escrow Agent in an interest bearing, money market or demand deposit account
with an institutional bank having offices in Georgia (" _Good Faith Deposit
Escrow Account_ "). All interest accruing on such Good Faith Deposit Escrow
Account shall be credited to Purchaser. The Purchaser shall pay the costs and
expenses of Escrow Agent and Disbursement Agent in connection with the
Transactions. Sellers, Purchaser and Escrow Agent shall enter into that
certain Good Faith Deposit Escrow Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit B_.

 



 

(b) The Good Faith Deposit shall be (i) applied at the Closing as a credit
against the Purchase Price, or (ii) given to Sellers as liquidated damages if
this Agreement is terminated (1) pursuant to _Section 12.1(e)_, or (2)
pursuant to _Section 12.1(b)_ and any of the conditions of _Section 10.3_
have not been satisfied. Except as described in the previous sentence, the
Good Faith Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser within five (5) Business
Days after any termination of the Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_.

 



 

(c) The Good Faith Deposit is deemed liquidated damages in favor of Sellers
and not as a penalty; it being agreed that Sellers actual damages are
impossible to estimate and that the amount of liquidated damages is a good
faith estimate of the actual

 



      
 

 



 

damages that would be suffered by Sellers as a result of a breach by Purchaser
of this Agreement, and that such liquidated damages shall be in lieu of any
other right or remedy of Sellers.

 



 

2.9 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities shall take
place at the offices of King and Spalding LLP, 1180 Peachtree Street, Atlanta,
Georgia, no later than five (5) Business Days after satisfaction of the

with the discharge of their fiduciary duties during the Bankruptcy Cases
(including soliciting higher or better offers for the Purchased Assets).
Sellers and Purchaser agree to execute and deliver such other documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as

in good faith (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or

Contracts or Intellectual Property Rights, in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions, and (b) in taking such actions or making any such
filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking

desirable in connection with the Bankruptcy Cases. Sellers also shall be
entitled to file copies with the Bankruptcy Court or as otherwise required by
Law

 



      
 

 



 

and shall be entitled to publish notice of the contemplated Transactions in
any newspaper selected by Sellers.

 



 

7.4 _Bankruptcy Issues._

 



 

(a) _Filing of Sale and Bidding Procedures Motion_. Within three (3) Business
Days of the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy
Court, and serve on all parties as required by the Bankruptcy Court or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, a motion in form and substance
satisfactory to Purchaser in its reasonable discretion (the " _Sale and
Bidding Procedures Motion_ ") seeking, among other things, the entry of (i)
the Approval Order, and (ii) an Order in form and substance satisfactory to
Purchaser in its reasonable discretion (the " _Bidding Procedures Order_ ")
approving the bidding procedures set forth in _Section 7.4(b)_ (the "
_Bidding Procedures_ ").

 



 

(b) _Bidding Procedures_. In the Sale and Bidding Procedures Motion, Sellers
shall seek, among other things, approval of the following Bidding Procedures,
which shall be incorporated into the Bidding Procedures Order:

 



 

(i) _Bid Deadline and Initial Overbids_. Any third party (other than
Purchaser) that is interested in acquiring the Purchased Assets must submit an
" _Initial Overbid_ " in conformance with this _Section 7.4(b)_ at or prior
to May 4, 2012 (the " _Bid Deadline_ "). Any such Initial Overbid must:

 



 

(A) Contain a signed definitive asset purchase agreement (together with a copy
of the signed agreement that is marked to show changes from this Agreement)
with, at a minimum, the following requirements: (w) having substantially
identical terms and conditions as this Agreement except with higher and better
consideration; (x) containing terms and conditions no less favorable to
Sellers estates than the terms and conditions in this Agreement (provided
that no Initial Overbid shall provide for the payment to the overbidder of any
breakup fee, topping fee, expense reimbursement or other similar arrangement);
(y) provide for a purchase price in an amount equal to or greater than the sum
of (1) the Purchase Price, (2) the Breakup Fee, and (3) $500,000 (the "
_Initial Overbid Amount_ "); and (z) not be subject to any (1) financing
contingency, (2) contingency relating to the completion of unperformed due
diligence, (3) contingency relating to the approval of the overbidders board
of directors or other internal approvals or consents, or (4) any conditions
precedent to the overbidders obligation to purchase the Purchased Assets
other than those included in this Agreement;

 



 

(B) Include a cashiers or certified check in the amount of Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000.00) to be held as a deposit (it being understood that the
deposit may also be sent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
Sellers counsel); and

 



      
 

 



 

(C) To the extent not previously provided to Sellers, be accompanied by
evidence satisfactory to Sellers in their commercially reasonable discretion
that the overbidder is willing, authorized, capable and qualified financially,
legally and otherwise, of unconditionally performing all obligations under the
Agreement (or its equivalent) in the event that it submits the Prevailing Bid
at the Auction.

 



 

(ii) _Auction_. In the event that Sellers timely receive a conforming Initial
Overbid from a prospective purchaser as described above (a " _Qualified
Bidder_ "), then Sellers will conduct an auction (the " _Auction_ ") with
respect to the sale of the Purchased Assets. In order to participate in the
Auction, each prospective purchaser shall be required to comply with the
requirements of the Bidding Procedures and to submit an Initial Overbid that
is timely and that complies in all respects with the Bidding Procedures. At
the Auction, Qualified Bidders and/or Purchaser may submit successive bids in
increments of at least $500,000 in cash greater than the prior bid (the "
_Incremental Bid Amount_ ") for the purchase of the Purchased Assets until
there is only one offer that Sellers determine, subject to Bankruptcy Court
approval, is the highest or best offer (the " _Prevailing Bid_ "). When
bidding at the Auction, Purchaser shall receive a "credit" in the amount of
the Breakup Fee. All bidding for the Purchased Assets will be concluded at the
Auction and there will be no further bidding at the Bankruptcy Court hearing
held in the Bankruptcy Cases to approve the highest or best bid for the
Purchased Assets (the " _Approval Hearing_ "). If no conforming Initial
Overbid from a Qualified Bidder shall have been received at or prior to the
Bid Deadline, the Auction will not be held and the Approval Hearing will
proceed with respect to this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) _Breakup Fee_. Upon the consummation of a sale of all or substantially
all of the Purchased Assets to any third party (other than Purchaser) who
submits a Prevailing Bid for the Purchased Assets, Sellers shall pay to
Purchaser cash or other immediately available funds in an amount equal to One
Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,800,000.00) (the " _Breakup Fee_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , the Breakup Fee shall not be due and payable if
Purchaser has committed a material breach of this Agreement prior to the
consummation of such sale to the third party. The Parties agree that the
Breakup Fee shall be the full and liquidated damages of Purchaser arising out
of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(f)_. The
provisions of this _Section 7.4(b)(iii)_ shall survive any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(f)_. The Breakup Fee shall be
treated as an administrative expense claim in the Bankruptcy Cases, shall be
paid to Purchaser within three (3) Business Days following the closing of such
sale to the third party, and shall be paid to Purchaser prior to the payment
of the proceeds of such sale to any third party asserting a Lien on the
Purchased Assets (and no Lien of any third party shall attach to the portion
of the sale proceeds representing the Breakup Fee).

 



 

(iv) _Backup Bid_. At the conclusion of the Auction, Sellers shall identify
and certify the bid that constitutes the second highest or best offer for the
Purchased Assets (the " _Backup Bid_ " and the Qualified Bidder submitting
such bid, the " _Backup Bidder_ "). The Backup Bidder may be required by
Sellers to close on the Backup Bid within twenty (20) days of the conclusion
of the Auction. In the event that

 



       
 

 



 

the Backup Bidder fails to close on the transaction contemplated in the Backup
Bid, Sellers shall be permitted to retain the Backup Bidders good faith
deposit as liquidated damages.

 



 

(c) _Cure Amount Bar Date_. The Bidding Procedures Order shall also set a bar
date (the " _Cure Amount Bar Date_ ") for objections to the assumption and
assignment of any potential Assumed Contracts, including objections to the
proposed Cure Costs that must be paid pursuant to Section 365(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code in order to assume and assign any Assumed Contract. The
Bidding Procedures Order shall provide that (i) the Cure Amount Bar Date shall
be not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Auction; and (ii) the
Sellers shall provide notice of the Cure Amount Bar Date to all non-debtor
parties to the Assumed Contracts.

 



 

(d) _Bankruptcy Court Approval of Sale_. Sellers shall secure the entry of an
Order, in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser and Sellers in their
reasonable discretion (the " _Approval Order_ "), of the Bankruptcy Court in
the Bankruptcy Cases (i) approving this Agreement and the Sellers performance
under this Agreement, (ii) authorizing the sale of the Purchased Assets free
and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens and the Assumed
Liabilities) pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, (iii) authorizing
the assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts pursuant to Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, (iv) authorizing the Transactions, and (v) providing
that this Agreement and the Transactions are undertaken by Purchaser and
Sellers at arms length, without collusion, and in good faith within the
meaning of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, that Purchaser and Sellers
are entitled to the protections of Section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and
that the provisions of Section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code are not
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall be entitled to take such
actions as may be required in connection with the discharge of their fiduciary
duties in the Bankruptcy Cases (including soliciting higher or better offers
for the Purchased Assets). Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith with
Sellers in connection with seeking entry of the Approval Order. In connection

 **8.** ** ****_Tax Matters_**.

 



 

8.1 _Tax Cooperation_. Purchaser and Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets
(including access to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the
preparation and filing of all Tax returns, the making of any election relating
to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any Claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax.
Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in good faith in the
conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the
Purchased Assets or the Business.

 



 

8.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Any and all sales, use, transfer, recording or other
similar taxes or charges (the "Transfer Taxes") assessed at Closing or at any
time thereafter on the transfer of any Purchased Assets shall be paid by
Purchaser. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in providing each other with
any appropriate resale exemption certifications and other similar
documentation.

 



 

8.3 _Property Taxes_. All Property Taxes for a Tax period which includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Apportioned
Obligations_ ") shall be apportioned between Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, based on the number of days of such Tax period
included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days of such Tax
period after the Closing Date (with respect to any such Tax period, the "
_Post-Closing Tax Period_ "). Sellers shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period reduced by the amount of Property Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period that are included in the Accrued Expenses (for which Purchaser
shall be responsible), and Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser
shall be liable for any such Property Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period that are included in the Accrued Expenses. The parties shall also
prorate at Closing real property lease rental payments, as well as utilities,
for the month of Closing.

 



 

8.4 _Apportionment_. Apportioned Obligations or Transfer Taxes shall be timely
paid, and all applicable filings, reports and returns shall be filed, as
provided by applicable Law. The paying Party shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the non-paying Party in accordance with _Section 8.2_ or
_8.3_ , as the case may be. Upon payment of any such Apportioned Obligation or
Transfer Tax, the paying Party shall present a statement to the non-paying
Party setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying Party is
entitled under _Section 8.2_ or _8.3_ , as the case may be, together with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to
be reimbursed. The non-paying Party shall make such reimbursement promptly but
in no event later than ten (10) days after the presentation of such statement.
Any payment not made within such time shall bear interest at the rate per
annum equal to the rate of interest announced by JP Morgan Chase N.A. from
time to time as its base rate in New York City.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.** ** ****_Employee Matters_**.

 



 

9.1 _Employees and Offers of Employment_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall be entitled (but shall not be required) to offer
employment (commencing on or after the Closing Date) to the employees of
either Seller who are employed in connection with the Business. Each such
employee who is offered employment by the Purchaser shall be offered the same
salary, wage, benefit levels, and such other terms and conditions, as
Purchasers employees in similar capacities on the Closing Date are entitled
to. Each employee of a Seller who accepts an offer of employment from
Purchaser shall constitute a "Transferred Employee". Purchaser shall be liable
for, and shall reimburse Sellers for (and indemnify Sellers from and against),
severance to be paid by Sellers to each employee of the Business that does not
become a Transferred Employee, in an amount equal to such employees salary or
wages for a four (4) week period, and all other costs, liabilities, claims,
damages and expenses incurred by Sellers as a result of the failure of
Purchaser to employ such employees. If any Transferred Employee is
subsequently terminated by Purchaser within the six (6) month period after the
Closing Date, then Purchaser shall make severance payments to such Transferred
Employee in an amount that is not less than an amount equal to such
Transferred Employees salary or wages for a four (4) week period (based on a
forty (40) hour work week) subject to the terminated employees release of all
claims.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall maintain employee records transferred to Purchaser
hereunder for a period of not less than four (4) years and during that period
will afford Sellers reasonable access to such records during Purchasers
normal business hours. Purchaser shall maintain the confidentiality of such
records and limit access thereto in a manner consistent with Purchasers
treatment of its employee records.

 



 

9.2 _Employee Plans_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing Date, (i) Purchaser shall ensure that no waiting
periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing
conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work
exclusions are applicable to any Transferred Employee or their dependents or
beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate; and (ii) Purchaser shall provide or cause to be
provided that any costs or expenses incurred by employees of Sellers (and
their dependents or beneficiaries) up to and including the Closing Date shall
be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-
payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or
limitations on coverage under any such welfare benefit plans.

 



 

(b) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy and practice, including
severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies and practices, sponsored
or maintained by Purchaser or its affiliates, Purchaser shall grant, or cause
to be granted, to all Transferred Employees from and after the Closing Date
credit for all service with Sellers and its predecessors, prior to the Closing
Date for all purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
eligibility to commence benefits, benefit accrual, early retirement subsidies
and severance).

 



 

9.3 _Successor Employer_. Purchaser shall use its best efforts to apply the
successor employer provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
31.3121(a)(1)-1(b) with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

each employee hired by Purchaser for the year of the Closing; provided,
however, it shall be the obligation and responsibility of the Sellers to
provide the employees of the Sellers COBRA Health Coordination Coverage
Notices and HIPAA Certificates of Creditable Coverage.

 



 

9.4 _Workers  Compensation_. Sellers shall be liable for all workers
compensation claims arising out of injuries with an identifiable date of
occurrence sustained by Sellers employees prior to the Closing Date.
Purchaser shall be liable for all workers compensation claims arising out of
injuries with an identifiable date of occurrence, sustained by Transferred
Employees on and after the dates (hereinafter, "Transferred Employees
Employment Date") Purchaser hires them, including injuries sustained by a
Transferred Employee on or after the Transferred Employees Employment Date
that are aggravations, exacerbations or re-injuries of medical conditions or
diagnoses resulting from injuries that were sustained before the Transferred
Employees Employment Date. Sellers shall be liable for all workers
compensation claims arising out of injuries or occupational diseases without
an identifiable date of occurrence or exposure, originating from within
Sellers facilities and which are alleged to have been sustained or contracted
prior to the Closing Date, provided such claims are filed with the appropriate
Workers Compensation authority within forty-five (45) days after the
Transferred Employees Employment Date. Purchaser shall be liable for all
workers compensation claims arising out of injuries or occupational diseases
without an identifiable date of occurrence or exposure, which are alleged to
have been sustained or contracted either before or after the Transferred
Employees Employment Date, provided that, in the case of any such injuries or
diseases allegedly sustained before the Transferred Employees Employment
Date, such claims are filed with the appropriate workers compensation
authority more than forty-five (45) days after the Transferred Employees
Employment Date.

(c) by Sellers or Purchaser, if any condition set forth in _Section 10.1_ is

any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such Party) to the other Party to this Agreement except as

based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the Transactions shall be brought exclusively in the Bankruptcy Court, and
each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of the
Bankruptcy Court (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any
such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in the Bankruptcy

Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on

Georgia, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding which

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.1_ shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

hereof and may be amended only by a writing executed by Purchaser and Sellers.

other Party hereto. This Agreement may be executed and forwarded to the other
Party by facsimile or electronic mail (i.e., pdf), and shall be effective upon
its delivery in such manner.

arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

13.10 _Time is of the Essence_. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

 



 

13.11 _Risk of Loss; Casualty and Condemnation._ Risk of loss as to the
Purchased Assets shall remain with Sellers until Closing.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ or the Closing Date, Sellers shall
maintain in full force and effect insurance covering the Acquired Owned Real
Property and the personal property located at the Acquired Owned Real Property
("Property Assets") for fire and extended perils. In the event of a casualty
loss occurring to any of the Property Assets ("Casualty") after the date of
this Agreement that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect, Purchaser shall
have the right to either take the proceeds from such insurance and complete
the Transactions, or to terminate this Agreement and have the Good Faith
Deposit returned with interest as herein provided. In the event of a Casualty
after the date of this Agreement that does not constitute a Material Adverse
Effect, Sellers shall not be obligated to repair or restore the Property
Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall pay the deductible under the
applicable insurance policy and shall assign to Purchaser the proceeds from
such insurance, whereupon the Transactions shall be consummated. If a Casualty
occurs that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect and Purchaser elects to take
proceeds from such insurance and complete the Transactions, the Sellers shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to do all things, at their own expense, as
may be necessary, including the obtaining of relevant mortgagees releases, in
order to ensure prompt payment of the proceeds of such insurance by the
insurer to the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , Sellers shall not be
obligated to repair or restore the Property Assets; _provided_ , _further_ ,
Sellers shall pay any applicable deductible under the insurance policy(ies).
In the event of a Casualty occurrence prior to the Closing Date, the Closing
Date shall be postponed until the loss is adjusted and the estimate for
repair, replacement or restoration has been approved by the insurance company.
Upon written receipt of the loss adjustment (this term shall be deemed a
written statement from the insurance company of the total amount of loss as
determined by the insurance company, and the amount that the insurance company
shall pay) and approved estimate by the insurance company, the Closing shall
be reset for a date no later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, whether
or not the repair, replacement or restoration has been completed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the loss adjustment and approved estimate by
the insurance company have not been received within forty-five (45) Business
Days from the date of casualty, unless Purchaser agrees to extend the Closing
Date, Purchaser has the option to terminate this Agreement and have the Good
Faith Deposit returned with interest as herein provided.

 



 

(b) If, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to or on the
Closing Date, all or any part of the Acquired Owned Real Property shall be
taken, or threatened to be taken, in the exercise of the power of eminent
domain by any sovereign, the

 



      
 

 



 

Sellers immediately shall notify Purchaser of such taking and provide
Purchaser with copies of all documents received by Sellers and relevant
thereto. If within ten (10) Business Days after receiving written notice from
Sellers of such taking, Purchaser shall notify Sellers of Purchasers election
to terminate this Agreement, the Good Faith Deposit shall be returned to
Purchaser. If Purchaser shall fail, within ten (10) Business Days of receiving
Sellers notice, to notify Sellers of Purchasers election to terminate this
Agreement, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, without
reduction in Purchase Price, and at the Closing, Sellers shall transfer and/or
assign to Purchaser any and all monies and claims relating to such taking;
_provided_ , _however_ , notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate the Agreement unless
the condemnation/taking constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.

return of the Earnest Money to Buyer pursuant to a termination of the Purchase
Agreement as a result of Termination based upon Section 12.1 (f) or (g),
Escrow Agents duty being to disburse the Escrow Fund to Buyer promptly upon

DEFAULT AND/OR DISPUTES. In the event any party to the transaction underlying
this Agreement shall tender any performance after the time when such
performance was due, Escrow Agent may proceed under this Agreement unless one
of the parties to this Agreement shall give to the Escrow Agent written
direction to stop further performance of the Escrow Agents functions
hereunder. In the event written notice of default or dispute is given to the
Escrow Agent by any party, or if Escrow Agent receives contrary written
instructions from any party, the Escrow Agent will promptly notify all parties
of such notice. Thereafter, Escrow Agent will decline to disburse funds or to
deliver any instrument or otherwise continue to perform its escrow functions,
except upon receipt of a mutual written agreement of the parties or upon an
appropriate order of court. In the event of a dispute, the Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit the escrow into a court of competent jurisdiction for a
determination as to the proper disposition of said funds. In the event that
the funds are deposited in court, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to file a
claim in the proceeding for its costs and counsel fees, if any.

      
 

 



 

PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES. In performing any of its duties under this Agreement,
or upon the claimed failure to perform its duties hereunder, Escrow Agent
shall not be liable to anyone for any damages, losses or expenses which may
occur as a result of Escrow Agent so acting, or failing to act; provided,
however, Escrow Agent shall be liable for damages arising out of its willful
default or gross negligence under this Agreement. Accordingly, Escrow Agent
shall not incur any such liability with respect to (i) any good faith act or
omission upon advice of counsel given with respect to any questions relating
to the duties and responsibilities of Escrow Agent hereunder, or (ii) any good
faith act or omission in reliance upon any document, including any written
notice or instructions provided for in the Agreement, not only as to its due
execution and to the validity and effectiveness of its provisions but also as
to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein, which Escrow
Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, to have been signed or
presented by the proper person or persons and to conform with the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



 

LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any loss or
damage resulting from the following:

 



 

The effect of the transaction underlying this Agreement including without
limitation, any defect in the title to the real estate, any failure or delay
in the surrender of possession of the property, the rights or obligations of
any party in possession of the property, the financial status or insolvency of
any other party, and/or any misrepresentation of fact made by any other party;

 



 

The default, error, act or failure to act by any other party to the escrow;

 



 

Any loss, loss of value or impairment of funds which have been deposited in
escrow while those funds are in the course of collection or while those funds
are on deposit in a depository institution if such loss or loss of value or
impairment results from the failure, insolvency or suspension of a depository
institution;

 



 

Any defects or conditions of title to any property that is the subject of this
escrow provided, however, that this limitation of liability shall not affect
the liability of First American Title Insurance Company under any title
insurance policy which it has issued or may issue. NOTE: No title insurance
liability is created by this Agreement.

 



 

Escrow Agents compliance with any legal process including but not limited to,
subpoena, writs, orders, judgments and decrees of any court whether issued
with or without jurisdiction and whether or not subsequently vacated,
modified, set aside or reversed.

 



 

HOLD HARMLESS. Buyer and Seller shall indemnify the Escrow Agent and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from all damage, costs, claims and expenses arising from
performance of its duties as Escrow Agent including reasonable attorneys
fees, except for those damages, costs, claims and expenses resulting form the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.

      
 

 



 

RELEASE OF PAYMENT. Payment of the funds so held in escrow by the Escrow
Agent, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Escrow
Agreement, shall fully and completely discharge and exonerate the Escrow Agent
from any and all future liability or obligations of any nature or character at
law or equity to the parties hereto or under this Agreement.

 **Atlanta, Georgia U.S.A.** 

 



 

 **FOR VALUE RECEIVED** , JCG Foods LLC, a limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware (the **" _Maker_ "**), promises to pay
to the order of Cagles, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of Georgia (the **" _Payee_ "**), the principal sum of
DOLLARS IN UNITED STATES CURRENCY (US$ ) (the
**" _Loan"_** ). The Loan shall be payable in accordance with the terms of
this Promissory Note (this **_"Note"_** ).

 



 

1. _Bankruptcy Case._ This Note is the "Purchase Note" described in that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated March 22, 2012, between Maker, Payee and Cagles Farms, Inc. (the **_"Agreement"_** ), as such Agreement was approved by order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the **_"Bankruptcy Court"_** ) entered on , 2012 (the **_"Approval Order"_** ) in the chapter 11 bankruptcy case of Payee (case no. 11-80202) (the **_"Bankruptcy Case"_** ).

 



 

2. _Maturity. _The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Loan shall become due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest on that portion of the principal amount, on the date that is two (2) years after the date of this Note, being , 20 (the **_"Maturity Date"_** ).

 



 

3. _Interest. _The Maker promises to pay interest on the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note at a rate per annum equal to eight percent (8%) (the **" _Interest Rate_ "**).

 



 

4. _Payment Terms._ On each of [September 1, 2012, December 1, 2012, March 1, 2013, June 1, 2013, September 1, 2013, December 1, 2013, March 1, 2014,](1) and the Maturity Date (the **_"Scheduled Payment Dates"_** ), Maker shall pay to the Payee an amount equal to (a) [insert amount equal to 1/8th of the principal amount of this Note], _plus_ (b) all accrued and unpaid interest on the Note as of such Scheduled Payment Date (the **_"Scheduled Payment Amounts"_** ); _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to the Scheduled Payment Amounts due on [September 1, 2012 and December 1, 2012, and the month of January 2013, if applicable], Makers obligation to pay such Scheduled Payment Amounts shall be deferred until February 1, 2013, at which time Maker shall pay such amounts to Payee (together with all interest accrued thereon). For the sake of clarity and avoidance of doubt, on the Maturity Date, the Maker shall make a payment to the Payee equal to (a) the unpaid and outstanding principal amount of this Note, plus (b) any accrued and unpaid interest on this Note.

  (1) Dates assume a May 2012 closing.

      
 

 



 

5. _Penalty Interest. _If any amount hereunder shall not be paid when due (at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), interest shall accrue on such amount from and including such due date until paid in full at a rate per annum equal to four percentage points (4%) in excess of the Interest Rate.

 



 

6. _Maximum Lawful Rate._ This Note is hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Payee for the use, forbearance or detention of money exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under applicable law. If, under any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof, at the time performance of such provision occurs, shall involve payment of interest in excess of that authorized by law, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limits so authorized by law, and if, from any circumstances, the Payee shall ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate applicable to the Maker, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance hereof and not to the payment of interest.

 



 

7. _Payments._ All payments of the Loan required by this Note shall be exclusively made in U.S. Dollars, free of any set-off or counterclaim, in immediately available funds, not later than 12:00 p.m. New York, New York time on the respective due date to an account and at such place and address to be designated by the Payee in writing. If the due date of any payment hereunder falls on a day that is a Saturday, Sunday or other day in which the commercial banks in the States of Georgia and New York are authorized or required to close, such date shall be extended to the next succeeding business day, and interest shall be payable for the period of such extension.

 



 

8. _Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Maker. _Maker represents, warrants and covenants to Payee that as of the date of this Note:

carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. The Maker
does not intend to, and does not believe that it will, incur indebtedness and
liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond
its ability to pay the same as they mature (taking into account the timing and
amounts of cash to be received by the Maker and the amounts to be payable on
or in respect of obligations of the Maker).

more than once in any calendar year, or (ii) with respect to any amounts
coming due on or after the Maturity Date;

 



 

(b) the Maker fails to observe or perform any other term, covenant, condition
or agreement of this Note or the Agreement (with respect to any obligations
owed by the Maker to the Payee), and such failure (i) is incapable of being
cured, or (ii) continues for twenty (20) calendar days after written notice
thereof from the Payee to the Maker;

 



 

(c) the commencement of a proceeding against the Maker for dissolution or
liquidation, or the voluntary or involuntary termination or dissolution of the

(d) the insolvency of, the business failure of, the appointment of a

under bankruptcy, insolvency or debtors relief law or the filing of a
petition for any adjustment of indebtedness, composition or extension by or
against the Maker;

 



 

(e) the entry of a judgment against the Maker in an amount in excess of
US$1,000,000.00 that has been approved by or is otherwise subject to a Final

(f) the seizure or forfeiture of, or the issuance of any writ of possession,
garnishment or attachment, or any turnover order for all or a material portion

(financial or otherwise), or operations of the Maker (for purposes of this
Note, a

reasonably likely to impair in a material way the value of Makers timely
repayment of this Note or otherwise prevent Maker from timely and fully
performing any of its material obligations under this Note);

 



 

(h) this Note becomes unenforceable or is terminated by operation of law or by
the Maker or the enforceability of this Note is challenged in any court by the
Maker;

 



 

(i) the Maker fails to pay when due (whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration, on demand or otherwise, and after giving effect to any
applicable grace period) the principal of or interest on any indebtedness
(other than the indebtedness evidenced by this Note) with an aggregate
outstanding principal amount in excess of US$1,000,000.00, or fails to observe
or perform within any applicable grace period any covenants or agreements
contained in any agreements or instruments relating to any indebtedness with
an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of US$1,000,000.00 or any
other event occurs if the effect of that failure or other event is to
accelerate, or to permit the holder of such indebtedness or any other
individual or entity to accelerate, the maturity of such indebtedness; or any
such indebtedness is required to be prepaid (other than by a regularly
scheduled required prepayment) in whole or in part prior to its stated
maturity.

 



 

The Maker shall promptly notify the Payee of (1) any Event of Default,
together with a detailed statement of the steps being taken to cure the same;
(2) any notice of default received by the Maker under any other obligations
material to the Makers finances; and (3) any threatened or pending legal,
judicial or regulatory proceedings, including any dispute between the Maker
and any governmental authority, affecting either the Maker or any of its

assets.

 



 

11. _Remedies._ Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default:

 



 

(a) _Acceleration_. The Payee and/or its assignee may without requirement of
any judicial or extrajudicial notice or interpellation of any kind, except as
expressly provided in Paragraph 10 herein: (i) accelerate any remaining terms
outstanding for the payment of the Loan, and (ii) declare the Loan with
accrued interest immediately due and payable.

 



 

(b) _Use of Courts_. The Payee may enforce this Note in any courts of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 

12. _Restrictions on Transfer._ The Maker agrees that it will not transfer this Note or any interest herein, whether by operation of law or otherwise, directly or indirectly except with the express written approval of the Payee. No transfer or purported transfer of this Note or any interest herein or obligation hereunder without the express written approval of the Payee shall be effective for any purpose or confer upon any transferee or purported transferee any rights whatsoever.

 



 

13. _Costs of Collection._ The Maker agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and expenses, actually incurred on an hourly basis and not as a 

 



      
 

 



 

percentage of the indebtedness, arising in connection with any enforcement or
collection action by the Payee, whether by or through an attorney or
collection agency or in an action in bankruptcy, insolvency or other judicial
proceedings. All such costs and expenses of collection shall be added to and
become part of the principal of this Note and shall be collectible as part of
such principal.

 



 

14. _Waivers; Amendment._

 



 

(a) The rights, powers and remedies provided to the Payee herein are
cumulative and not exclusive of any right, power or remedy provided at law or
in equity, and the Payee may enforce any one or more remedies hereunder
successively or concurrently, at its option. No delay or failure on the part
of the Payee to exercise any right or remedy accruing to the Payee hereunder,
upon any default or breach by the Maker of any term or provision hereof, shall
be held to be an abandonment thereof. No delay on the part of the Payee in
exercising any of its rights or remedies shall preclude the Payee from the
exercise thereof at any time during the continuance of any default or breach.
No waiver of a single default or breach shall be deemed a waiver of any
subsequent default or breach. All waivers under this Note must be in writing
signed by the party entitled to enforce the right waived. All amendments to
this Note must be in writing and signed by both the Maker and the Payee.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Maker, its successors and
assigns, and any other persons liable for the payment of this Note, waive
presentment for payment, demand, protest and notice of demand, dishonor,
protest and nonpayment, and consent to any and all renewals, extensions or
modifications that might be made by the Payee and the Maker as to the time of
payment of this Note from time to time. The Maker also expressly waives, as a
defense, any counterclaim, set-off or claim that the Maker may now or
hereafter have against the holder of this Note.

 



 

15. _Severability._ The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder hereof in that jurisdiction or the validity or enforceability of this Note, including that provision, in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each party hereto waives any provision of applicable law that renders any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect. If any provision of this Note is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be adjusted rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties hereto to the closest extent possible.

 



 

16. _Notices. _All notices, requests, or consents provided for or permitted to be given under this Note must be in writing and are effective (a) on actual receipt by the addressee if personally delivered (including delivery against a written receipt by an internationally recognized courier) to the address below or (b) on transmission (with written confirmation of receipt, whether from the transmitters machine or otherwise) to the addressee if transmitted by facsimile to the number below during normal business hours of the addressee on a business day (or if transmitted outside such hours, as of the opening of business of the addressee on the next business day):
