the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary_ ")
a certificate of merger effecting the Merger in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), as provided
in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary or at such
other date or time as Parent and Company shall agree in writing and shall
specify in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall succeed to all the properties, assets, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the debts,
liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub,

of the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger.

1.5 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company
or the holders of any shares of capital stock or Equity Interests of Parent,
Merger Sub or Company:

 

(a) Each share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time after giving effect to the Specified
Exchange (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) (except for, in each case,
shares (x) (i) held in the treasury of Company or (ii) owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries and
(y) Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement, into the right to
receive an amount equal to (A) $21.07 in cash, without interest minus (B) the
Adjustment Amount (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The " _Adjustment Amount_
" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient of (i) the total costs actually
incurred by Parent with respect to the items set forth on Annex A, and (ii)
the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding on
the Closing Date (after giving effect to the Specified Exchange (as defined in
the Exchange Agreements) but excluding shares held in the treasury of
Company) plus the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock issuable in
respect of the Company Equity Awards outstanding on the Closing

 



3  Date, whether vested or unvested; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will the Adjustment Amount exceed $0.44. The Adjustment Amount shall be deemed
to be zero in the event that Parent or Merger Sub have breached any covenant
or agreement contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ of this Agreement and such
breach has materially delayed the clearance, termination, or expiration of any
required waiting period under the HSR Act.

(b) Each share of Company Class B Common Stock outstanding or held in

retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 

(c) All the shares of Company Class A Common Stock converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ I_ shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old
Certificate_ ", it being understood that any reference herein to "Old
Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Class A Common
Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon. Without limiting the other provisions
of this Agreement, if following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, Company Common Shares or other Equity
Interests of Company shall have been increased, decreased or changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities (other than
the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of Company as permitted by
this Agreement and the issuance of shares of Company Class A Common Stock in
connection with the Exchanges), including by reason of a reorganization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any other similar event,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to
reflect such event.

Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock or
Equity Interests of Parent, Merger Sub or Company, all shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by Company (including if held in the
treasury of Company), Parent or Merger Sub or their direct or indirect
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the
Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

1.6 _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Class
A Common Stock granted by Company, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to be outstanding and shall not
be assumed.

 



4 (b) In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each
Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested as
of the Effective Time, Parent shall issue an option to purchase Parent Common
Shares (each, a " _Substitute Stock Option_ "). Each Substitute Stock Option
generally shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to the Company Stock Option in respect of which such
Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any vesting provisions), provided that (i) each Substitute Stock
Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole Parent Common Shares
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (w) the
number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that were issuable upon the
exercise of the Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) in respect of which
such Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (x) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the per share exercise price for the
Parent Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such Substitute Stock Option
shall equal the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (y) the
exercise price per share of Company Class A Common Stock applicable to the
Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) in respect of which such Substitute
Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time and (z) the
Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each Company
Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and vested (based
solely on the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option and without the
exercise of any discretion by Company or any other Person) as of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
to pay the holder thereof an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings)
within ten (10) days after the Closing Date equal to the product of (i) the
Merger Consideration, minus the per share exercise price for the Company
Class A Common Stock issuable under such Company Stock Option (or portion
thereof), multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Class A Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) as of
the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted by Company, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding as of the Effective Time (a " _Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award_ " and, together with the Company Stock Options,
the " _Company Equity Awards_ ") shall be canceled and shall cease to be
outstanding and shall not be assumed.

(e) In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award that is outstanding and unvested as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall issue an award of time-vesting restricted stock
units (each a " _Substitute RSU Award_ ") relating to the number of Parent
Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit
Award was unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. Each Substitute RSU Award issued pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 1.7(e)_ generally shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including, without limitation, any time-based vesting schedule) as applied
to the related Company Restricted Stock Unit Award in respect of which such
Substitute RSU Award was granted, provided that any performance vesting
condition shall be waived.

 



5 (f) In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is outstanding and vested (based
solely on the terms of the applicable Company Restricted Stock Unit Award and
without the exercise of any discretion by Company or any other Person) as of
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of
its Subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount in cash within ten (10)
days after the Closing Date equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Class A
Common Stock with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award
was so vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the forgoing or any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Substitute Stock Options and the Substitute RSU Awards will be
revised to reflect that such awards are in respect of Parent Common Shares,
and may contain such modifications to the Company Equity Awards as Parent
deems appropriate to reflect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Company becoming a Subsidiary
of Parent.

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all actions necessary
to cause the Company Equity Awards to be treated as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_, including, without limitation, the Company Board and its
compensation committee, as applicable, adopting any resolutions and taking
all other actions (including providing any required notices and obtaining any
required consents) that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
holder of vested Company Stock Options shall be entitled to exercise his or
her vested Company Stock Options prior to the Effective Time by tendering to
Company a check in the full amount of their respective exercise price, in
which case such holder shall be treated as a holder of Company Class A Common
Stock under _Section_ __ _ 1.5_. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable to the holders of the Company Equity Awards
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries is required to withhold
from such holders in connection with such payments under the Code or any
other provision of Tax Laws. To the extent withheld and deducted, such amounts
shall be remitted by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to the applicable Governmental Entity on behalf of
the applicable holders of the Company Equity Awards and treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holders of
the Company Equity Awards.

 

1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of
Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth on
_Exhibit B_ hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in their entirety as the
bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
(provided that the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced with the name of the
Surviving Corporation). 

1.9 _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. Each of the parties hereto
shall take all necessary action to cause the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier
death,

 



6  resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified
or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Paying Agent; Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a paying agent
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Company with a
paying agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited by Merger Sub, with the Paying Agent, for the
benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with
this _Article_ __ _ II_, cash in an amount sufficient to allow the Paying
Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of
all of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock represented by the Old
Certificates, other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be cancelled and
retired pursuant to _Sections 1.5(b)_ and _(d)_ (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, or as otherwise directed by Parent. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than
ten (10) calendar days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of
record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Class A
Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than any shares to be cancelled and
retired pursuant to _Sections 1.5(b)_ and _(d)_ ), a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery or transfer, as applicable, of the Old Certificates to the Paying
Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no amount payable in respect of
the Company Equity Awards shall be included in the Payment Fund.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (other than the
Dissenting Shares and any shares cancelled and retired pursuant to _Sections
1.5(b)_ and _(d)_ ) shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock represented by an Old
Certificate as promptly as reasonably practicable following (i) surrender to
the Paying Agent of an Old Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(f)_), together with a
duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent (or receipt of an
"agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of book-entry
shares, together with such

 



7  other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent). No
interest will be paid or accrued with respect to any property to be delivered
upon surrender of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered or transferred Old
Certificate, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that (i) such Old Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall
otherwise be in proper form for transfer (in the case of a book-entry share,
such Old Certificate shall be properly transferred), and (ii) the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance any transfer
or other similar Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Old Certificate, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of Company who have
not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this _Article_
__ _ II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Merger Consideration, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(f) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent) by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, and following the Paying Agents receipt of
Letter of Transmittal required by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old
Certificate the Merger Consideration.

 

2.2 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock the
holder of which has not voted in favor of, or otherwise consented to, the
adoption of this Agreement and that is entitled to and has properly perfected
his, her or its right to dissent under Section 262 of the DGCL and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time with respect
to such shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled only to receive

 



8  payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except as provided
in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. Company shall give Parent prompt written
notice upon receipt by Company of any such demands for payment of the fair
value of such shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of such notice
and any other instruments provided pursuant to applicable Law with respect to
appraisal rights (any stockholder duly making such demand being hereinafter
called a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ "). Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make, or commit or agree to
make, any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demand for appraisal or payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such
Dissenting Stockholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under
the DGCL. Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be made by
the Surviving Corporation.

respective business of Company and each of its Subsidiaries does not
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate and since January 1, 2014 has

25  transfer of Intellectual Property of Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as

acquired or developed and have industry standard and commercially reasonable
security, back-ups and disaster recovery arrangements in place, except as

the availability, security and integrity of the Information Systems and all
data and information stored thereon, including from unauthorized access and

have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Information Systems of Company and its Subsidiaries have not, to
Companys knowledge, suffered any material security breach or material
failure. No material included in the Company Owned Intellectual Property
contains any computer code or any other procedure, routine or mechanism which
may cause any Company Owned Intellectual Property to be subject to any Open

legal right (whether contractually, by Law or otherwise) to access and use

Company and its Subsidiaries. Company and each Subsidiary has commercially
reasonable safeguards in place to protect Personal Information in its

as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) there has been no
unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Information in the
possession or control of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
contractors, (ii) Company and its Subsidiaries have at all times complied with

and use of personal information and user information including that of its

Date, Surviving Corporation shall have rights to use such information
equivalent to the rights to use such information that Company and its
Subsidiaries had prior to the Closing Date. Neither the execution, delivery
nor performance of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement will violate any applicable
privacy Law as it currently exists or existed at any time during which any of
the Personal Information was collected or obtained.

 

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger

Intellectual Property.

Except (a) as disclosed in the corresponding sections of the disclosure
schedule delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to Company prior to the execution
hereof (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "); _provided_ , that (i) no such
item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or
warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or
warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item
in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent or Merger Sub that
such item has had or would reasonably be reasonably expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (iii)
any disclosures made with respect to a Section of this _Article_ __ _
IV_ shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other Section of this _Article_ __ _

any Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, except (in the case of this _clause (ii)(D)_ ) for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or creations which would not reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Requirements, (ii) where the failure to obtain such approval or consent would
not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, no consents or approvals of or filings or

hereof, (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in breach of any of the terms or
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) to Parents
knowledge, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a breach, default or failure by Parent or Merger Sub
to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof,
no Lender has notified Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate the
Debt Commitment Letter or not to provide the Financing. The net proceeds from
the Financing, together with cash on hand at the Parent, will be sufficient to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions

 



31  contemplated by this Agreement, including the payment by Parent and Merger
Sub of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses of or payable
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and any related repayment
or refinancing of any Indebtedness of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all commitment or
other fees required by the Debt Commitment Letter that are due as of the date
hereof. Other than the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side
letters, understandings or other agreements or arrangements setting forth
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates are a party. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing or
the conditions precedent thereto, other than as explicitly set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "). As of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any legally binding obligation to
accept any condition precedent to such funding other than the Disclosed
Conditions, nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the
Debt Commitment Letter on the Closing Date (nor any term (including any flex
or original issue discount term) or condition which would have the effect of
reducing the aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letter on
the Closing Date). As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing at the Closing,
or that the Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the
Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing.

4.8 _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, their
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors
has employed any broker, finder, financial advisor or other similar person, or
incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, other than with respect to Wells
Fargo Securities, LLC.

 

4.9 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub in this
_Article_ __ _ IV_ or the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_, neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor any other person on their behalf)
makes or has made any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries or affiliates or
their respective business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects, or with respect
to any estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information
or business or strategic plan information regarding Parent, Merger Sub and
their Subsidiaries, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information (including any statement, document or agreement delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or any financial statements, including projections,
estimates, forecasts or other forward-looking information) provided (including
in any management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum, "data
rooms" maintained by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives, supplemental
information or other materials or information with respect to any of the
above) or otherwise made available to Company or any of its affiliates,
stockholders or Representatives (in any form or through any medium). In
particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
expressly set forth in 

 



32  this _Article IV_ or the certificate delivered pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_, neither Parent nor Merger Sub (nor any other person on their behalf)
makes or has made any express or implied representation or warranty to
Company or any of its Representatives with respect to (a) any financial
projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information relating to
Parent, Merger Sub, any of their Subsidiaries or their respective businesses
or (b) any oral or written information presented to Company or any of its
respective Representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation
of Parent and Merger Sub, the negotiation of this Agreement or the course of
the transactions related hereto.

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be permitted to conduct any
invasive sampling or testing, including any Phase II environmental
assessment, with respect to any property of Company or its Subsidiaries. Upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of Parent reasonable
access, during normal business hours from the date hereof until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to all of Companys
properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems and
records, and each shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and 

 



36  business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, nondisclosure and similar agreements with service providers),
and, during such period, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make available to Parent such information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, in each case other than any
such matters that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
or (except as required by _Section_ __ _ 6.8_) to transactions potentially
competing with or alternative to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or proposals from other parties relating to any competing
or alternative transactions. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to minimize any interference with Companys regular business operations during
any such access. Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws,
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish or otherwise make
available to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other
representatives of Parent such information concerning its businesses as is
reasonably relevant to Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would, based on the advice of outside counsel, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common
interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties) or
contravene any Law, fiduciary duty, or binding agreement entered into prior
to the date of this Agreement. Company will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Each party shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of it
or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.1(a)_ in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the
provisions of the Mutual Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement, dated
March 27, 2017, by and between Parent and Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

(c) No investigation by Parent, Company or their respective
representatives pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set
forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to give either
Parent or Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, it is intended that each party shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.2 _Information Statement_.

 

(a) Parent and Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare and Company
shall promptly file with the SEC no later than ten (10) calendar days after
the date of this Agreement the Information Statement. The Information

appraisal rights and related disclosure required by Section 262 of the DGCL.

37  Information Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent agrees, as to itself
and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it to Company in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Information Statement will when filed with the SEC and at the
time it is mailed to holders of Company Common Stock, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
Parent further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished
by it would cause any of the statements in the Information Statement to be
false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform Company and to take appropriate steps to
correct the Information Statement. Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Information Statement
as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to have the
Information Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as promptly
as reasonably practicable after such filing.

(c) No amendment or supplement to the Information Statement will be
made by Company without the approval of the Parent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Company shall promptly provide
notice to Parent of any correspondence or communications with or comments from
the SEC and shall provide Parent with copies of all such written comments and
written correspondence and a detailed written summary of any substantive oral
communications with the SEC. Company shall not submit any response letters or
other correspondence to the SEC without the approval of Parent (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) Prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect thereto, Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response
and shall, in good faith, consider the reasonable comments of Parent. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Information Statement has been
cleared by the SEC or after ten (10) calendar days have passed since the date
of filing of the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice
from the SEC of its intent to review the Information Statement, Company shall
promptly file with the SEC the Information Statement in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in
the form previously cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and
mail a copy of the Information Statement to Companys stockholders of record
in accordance with Sections 228 and 262 of the DGCL.

interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) cooperate with each other
in (A) determining which filings are required to be made prior to

obligated or required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to waive a condition to
Closing set forth in _Article_ __ _ VII_.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_, and subject
to _Sections 6.3(c)_ , Parent and Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to (i) as soon as practicable and in no event later
than ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, each prepare and
file any pre-merger notification required under the HSR Act to be filed with

Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") and (ii) promptly provide any supplemental
information requested or required by the FTC and DOJ in connection with such
notification in substantial compliance with the HSR Act and other applicable

and/or any third party, on the other hand, (x) each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions

with respect thereto; and (z) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each

the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate therein. The parties hereto agree that

restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, Company, Parent
or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services
of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or
without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish,
amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the
ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates
to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or
any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after
the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any person, other than the parties hereto, including
any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary
thereof, Parent agrees to cause Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of Company and
its Subsidiaries or fiduciaries of Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in

 



41  connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in
part out of (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was a fiduciary of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Company Benefit Plans, in each case
at or prior to the Effective Time or (ii) matters, acts or omissions existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction Documents,
the Information Statement and the documents referenced herein and therein, in
each case to the same extent (and solely to such extent) as such persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the
Charter Documents and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the
date hereof that are set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and Parent shall also cause the Surviving Corporation to
advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the same
extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date
of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the Charter Documents and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof that are set
forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking consistent with the Company Certificate, the Company
Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Company
or any such indemnification agreements, as applicable, and applicable Law to
repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification. Until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provision in the Surviving Corporations or its Subsidiaries certificate of
formation, certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation, operating
agreement, by-laws or equivalent governing documents as in effect as of the
date hereof relating to the exculpation or indemnification (including fee
advancement) of any Company Indemnified Party in a manner that
would adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnified Party
thereunder.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, until the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained
by Company ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured in the aggregate) with respect to claims against
the present and former officers and directors of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Company for such
insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in
the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum
coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, Company, in consultation with Parent may (and at the request of
Parent, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior
to the Effective Time a six (6) year "tail" policy under Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap
and, if such a "tail" policy is purchased, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall have no further obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.5(b)_.

 



42 (c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. If the Surviving Corporation, or any of its successors or
assigns, consolidates with or merges into any other entity and is not the
continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfers all
or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engages
in any similar transaction, then in each case, the Surviving Corporation will
cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ (unless such assumption occurs by operation of law).

6.6 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, each party to this Agreement and their respective
Subsidiaries shall take, or cause to be taken, all such necessary action as
may be reasonably requested by any other party, at the expense of the party
who makes any such request. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor in accordance
with their terms, all Contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly advise
the other of (a) any notice or other communication from any person alleging
that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) subject to, and not in
limitation of _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, any Actions commenced, or to such partys
knowledge, threatened in writing, against Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, that are related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (d) any fact, change, event
or circumstance known to such party, any breach, inaccuracy
or misrepresentation of a representation or warranty of such party set forth
in this Agreement or any breach or non-performance of a covenant or obligation
of such party set forth in this Agreement (i) that has had or would
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate with
all other such matters, a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material
Adverse Effect, or (ii) which it believes would or would be
reasonably expected to cause a condition to Closing set forth in _Article_ __
_ VII_ to not be satisfied. In no event shall (x) the delivery of any notice
by a party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ limit or otherwise affect
the respective rights, obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement, or (y) disclosure by Company or Parent be deemed to
amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Parent Disclosure
Schedules or constitute an exception to any representation or warranty.

 



43 6.8 _Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on August 20, 2017 (the " _Go-Shop
Period_"), Company (acting under the direction of the Special Committee),
its Subsidiaries, their respective affiliates and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to directly or indirectly: (i) initiate,
solicit, facilitate and encourage Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries,
proposals or offers or other efforts or attempts that may to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal), including by way of providing access to non-public
information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with each recipient thereof and, in each case, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_; _provided_
, that Company shall promptly (in any event, within one (1) business day)
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided to any person given such access which was not
previously provided or made available to Parent or its Representatives,
and Company shall withhold such portions of documents or information, or
provide pursuant to customary "clean-room" or other appropriate procedures, to
the extent relating to any commercially sensitive or relate to pricing or
other matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature if the
exchange of such information (or portions thereof) would reasonably be
materially harmful to the operations of Company; (ii) enter into, engage in,
and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Acquisition
Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations; and
(iii) amend or grant a waiver or release under a standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any Equity Interests of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries solely to the extent necessary to permit the counterparty to such
standstill or similar agreement to make a non-public Acquisition Proposal to
the Company Board or the Special Committee during the Go-Shop Period.

 

(b) Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives (i) beginning at 12:00 a.m. (on New York City
time) on August 21, 2017 (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_") to immediately
cease and terminate any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any persons with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or a
potential Acquisition Proposal (including any of the activities permitted by
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(a)_), (ii) terminate access to any physical or electronic
data rooms related to a possible Acquisition Proposal (other than a data room
utilized solely by Parent, its affiliates and their respective Representatives
and not any third person) and (iii) request that any such person and its
Representatives promptly return or destroy all confidential information
concerning Company and its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished thereto by or on
behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and destroy all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such person that contain, reflect
or analyze such information, in each case, in accordance with the applicable
confidentiality agreement between Company or any of its affiliates, on one
hand, and such person, on the other hand. From the No-Shop Period Start Date
(and, solely with respect to a Holdover Proposal, the Delayed No-Shop Period
Start Date) until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article_ __ _ VIII_, Company shall not, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
any inquiries regarding, or the making or announcement of any proposal or
offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (B) conduct or engage in, enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any
information or data to, any person that is seeking 

 



44  to make, has made or, to the knowledge of Company, is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or otherwise take such actions in connection with or for
the purpose of knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating an Acquisition
Proposal, (C) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (D)
enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal (including an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(c) Except as expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.8(d)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof (including the Special Committee)
shall (i) (A) fail to recommend to its stockholders that the Requisite Company
Vote be given (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (B) change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer (other than a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication
by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or an
express rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer or reaffirmation of
the Company Board Recommendation), (D) fail to recommend against acceptance of
any tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) business days of the
commencement of such offer, (E) adopt, approve, endorse or recommend, or

(actions described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause or permit Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, or other similar
agreement relating to or providing for any Acquisition Proposal or an
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement
providing for or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (each, a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iii) except as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)_, grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any class of Equity Interests of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any confidentiality agreement or Takeover
Statute or (iv) take any action pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the No-
Shop Period Start Date (and, solely with respect to a Holdover Proposal, the
Delayed No-Shop Period Start Date), but not after, the Company Board or the
Special Committee may, in each case so long as the Company has complied in
all material respects with the requirements of and not breached in any
material respect this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, (A) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event or
Superior Proposal and/or (B) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(e)_ to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, in each case, if and only if, prior to taking of the action
in either clause (A) or (B), the Company Board or a duly authorized committee
thereof (including the Special Committee) concludes in good faith, after
consultation with Special Committee Financial Advisor and outside legal
counsel, (x) that failure to take such action would be reasonably expected to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and
(y) that, if applicable, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that, prior to taking the action in
either clause (A) or (B) above, (i) the Company Board and the Special
Committee has given Parent at least five (5) business days prior written
notice (such period, the " _Notice Period_ " and any such notice with respect
to a Superior Proposal, the " _Initial Superior Proposal Notice_ ") of its
intention to take such action

 



45  (which notice shall include, as applicable, a reasonably detailed written
summary of the Intervening Event or unredacted copies of the Superior Proposal
and any material transaction agreements and financing commitments (provided
that such financing commitments may include customary redactions) and a
written summary of the material terms of any Superior Proposal not made in
writing, including any financing commitments relating thereto), (ii) after
providing such notice, Company shall have negotiated, and shall have caused
its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) during the Notice Period to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Financing as would
permit the Company Board or the Special Committee not to take such action, and
(iii) following the end of the Notice Period, the Company Board or a duly
authorized committee thereof (including the Special Committee, if such
committee still exists), shall have considered in good faith any proposed
revisions to this Agreement and the Financing proposed in writing by Parent,
and shall have determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
the Special Committee Financial Advisor, that failure to take such actions
continues to be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law even if such proposed revisions by the
Parent to this Agreement and the Financing were to be given effect, and (iv)
in the event of any change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal (or
amendment thereof) occurring prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date Company
shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice (each such
notice, a " _Superior Proposal Change Notice_ ") consistent with that
described in clause (i) above and the Notice Period in clause (i) shall have
recommenced and the condition in clauses (ii) and (iii) shall have occurred
again, except that the Notice Period shall be at least two (2) business days
(rather than the five (5) business days otherwise contemplated by clause (i)
above). In the event that the No-Shop Period Start Date is scheduled to begin
within (a) five (5) business days of delivery of an Initial Superior Proposal
Notice or (b) two (2) business days of delivery of a Superior Proposal Change
Notice (such applicable notice period, the " _Holdover Notice Period_ "), the
No-Shop Period Start Date solely with respect to the Acquisition Proposal
that is the subject of the Holdover Notice Period (the " _Holdover Proposal_
") will be extended until 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the business day
immediately following the final day of such Holdover Notice Period (the "
_Delayed No-Shop Period Start Date_").

 

(e) From and after the date hereof, Company shall notify Parent as promptly
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) in
the event that (i) Company, its Subsidiaries, affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives receives (A) an Acquisition Proposal or any
amendment thereto or (B) any request for discussions or negotiations, any
request for access to the properties or books and records of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of which Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives is or has become aware, or any request for
information relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, by
any person that could reasonably be expected to be considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) Company enters into any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (which notice shall include a copy of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Such notice to Parent shall indicate
the identity of the person or group of persons making such Acquisition
Proposal or amendment thereto and provide (x) an unredacted copy of such
written Acquisition Proposal or amendment thereto (including, in each case,
financing commitments with customary redaction) and any material transaction
documents, and (y) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or amendment
thereto not made in writing, a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of each such Acquisition Proposal or amendment

 



46  thereto. Company shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis
(and, in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of Companys knowledge of any
such event) of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposals, or material changes to the terms of any
such Acquisition Proposal or any amendment thereto (including copies of any
written proposed agreements). Company hereby agrees that it shall not, and
shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, enter into any Contract that prohibits
or restricts it from providing to Parent the information contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8(e)_ or from complying with the other provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Company or Company
Board or the Special Committee from complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 and
14e-2 under the Exchange Act and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from issuing
a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder or making any required disclosure to Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board or the
Special Committee, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required
under applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, complying with such
obligations or making such disclosure shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any such action has under this Agreement (including
whether such action constitutes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

 

6.9 _Public Announcements_. Except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement, and unless and until a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has
occurred, Parent and Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude is required by
applicable Law or any applicable exchange requirement or Order.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and without complying with
the preceding sentence, (a) each party may make any public statement regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in response to questions from
the press, analysts, existing or potential investors, existing or potential
lenders, or those attending industry conferences, and may make internal
announcements to employees, in each case to the extent (and only to such
extent) that such statements are not inconsistent with the Information
Statement or previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made jointly by the parties and do not reveal material non-public information
regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) Company may issue any press release or make any other public statement or
comment to be issued or made with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or with
respect to any actions contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.8(b)_ (if and only
to the extent such public statement or comment is permitted by _Section_ __ _
6.8_), (c) Parent may issue any press release or make any other public
statement or comment (i) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that has
been publicly announced or is publicly known or (ii) in connection with the
Financing (including any public filings in connection therewith) and (d) each
party may make any disclosure of information or public announcement
concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement.

 



47 6.10 _Transaction Litigation_. Company shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by or
before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending
or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against Company, its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective directors or officers relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger (" _Transaction
Litigation_ ") prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination
of this Agreement. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ VIII_, Company shall
control the defense of any Transaction Litigation threatened against Company
or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that Company shall (a) give
Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or responses to
be made by Company in connection with any such Transaction Litigation (and
Company shall in good faith take such comments into account), and the
opportunity to participate in the defense and settlement of, any such
Transaction Litigation and (b) if Parent does not exercise such right to
participate (subject to Companys control right), keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status of such Transaction Litigation.
Company agrees that it shall not settle, or offer to settle, any
Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

6.11 _Takeover Statutes_. Each party shall take all necessary steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover
Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party
and its respective board of directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions within its control as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Company and its Subsidiaries shall not take any action to
exempt any person from, or make any acquisition of securities or Equity
Interests of Company by any person not subject to, any Takeover Statute or
similar Law that applies to Company with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise, except for Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or affiliates, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.12 _Exemption from Liability Under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Company shall take such steps as may be required to cause any
disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of shares of Company Common Stock including LLC Units
and LLC Options by an individual subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent possible.

 

6.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause each of its
affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and consummate the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including the flex provisions), including

 



48  using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under
the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to and as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
on terms and conditions (including flex provisions) no less favorable to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including definitive
agreements related thereto but excluding any conditions that have been
waived), including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement
fees required as a condition to the Financing, (iv) maintain in effect the
Debt Commitment Letter and (v) consummate the Financing at or prior to the
Closing Date (it being understood that it is not a condition to Closing under
this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or Merger
Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing). Parent and Merger
Sub shall keep Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
(or replacement thereof) as Company may reasonably request; _provided_ , that
in no event will Parent or Merger Sub be under any obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege if Parent
or Merger Sub shall have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent and Merger
Sub shall give Company prompt notice (x) of any material breach or default by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes
aware, (y) of the receipt of any written notice from any Lender with respect
to any (1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letter of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to the obligation to fund
the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded on the Closing
Date, and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within two (2) business days of the date Company delivers to Parent or Merger
Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by Company relating to any circumstance referred to in
clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. Parent shall
not, without the prior written consent of Company, amend, modify, supplement
or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter or any other provision of, or remedies under, the
Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that (A) imposes additional or adversely
modifies conditions or other contingencies to the availability of the
Financing relative to those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement, (B) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially impair or delay the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or the Closing, or (C)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Parent may by joinder, amendment and restatement or
similar means add additional banks or financial institutions as arrangers,
agents, committing parties or lenders under the Debt Commitment Letter. In the
event all conditions applicable to the Debt Commitment Letter have been
satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders
to fund the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the date that the Closing should occur pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.2_ or, if such date has already passed, as promptly as practicable
(including by paying

 



49  or causing to be paid any commitment or other fees arising, but excluding
the commencement of litigation against such Person). In the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, Parent shall notify Company and
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative financing from the same
or other sources of financing on terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than those contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, and in an amount
sufficient to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth herein. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parents obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to the
obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require, and
in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be
deemed or construed to require, Parent or Merger Sub to commence litigation
against any Lender, pay any fees in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, or agree to any "market flex" terms less favorable in any
material respect to Parent than such corresponding market flex terms contained
in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(b) Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall request
their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense, use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent, Merger Sub and their
authorized Representatives in connection with the arrangement and consummation
of the Financing (or any permitted replacement, amended, modified or
alternative financing), including (i) participating in a reasonable number of
meetings and due diligence sessions on reasonable advance notice and at
reasonable locations, (ii) promptly furnishing Parent, Merger Sub and
the Lenders with the Required Information and information which any lender
providing or arranging the Financing has requested under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including USA
PATRIOT Act, FATCA and OFAC at least five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date, to the extent requested at least ten (10) business days prior to

CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY

any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ that (a) prior to the Effective
Time, Merger Sub may, without the prior written consent of Company, assign all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to one or more of Parents
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries or affiliates, and (b) Parent
and Merger Sub may collaterally assign their rights

 



71  hereunder to any financing sources. No assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment
in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to
herein) is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, except (i) as
otherwise specifically provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, which is intended to
benefit each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives and (ii) the Lenders and the Lender Related Parties are
intended third party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, _Section_ __ _
10.9_, _Section_ __ _ 10.15_ and this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ and (iii) after
the Effective Time, for the provisions of _Article II_ , which shall be
enforceable by the stockholders of Company and holders of Company Equity
Awards to the extent necessary to receive the consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Article II_. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement or characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Except
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, notwithstanding
any other provision hereof to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement
of any third party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify or waive any
provision of this Agreement.

 

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and that the
parties may not have an adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
obligations of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be
entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including
the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, including monetary
damages. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate, (b) an
award of performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity, and (c) any requirement under any Law to post security or a bond or
similar undertaking as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

10.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision
of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion
of any provision in such jurisdiction or the application of that provision,
in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction such that a suitable and equitable provision
shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or
unenforceable provision.

 



72 10.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

 

10.15 _Lenders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither any Lender nor any Lender Related Party shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this
Agreement or for any claim (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of (or in any way relating to), the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated thereby or
the performance thereof and the parties hereto agree not to assert any such
claim or bring any action, suit or proceeding in connection with any such
claim against any Lender or any Lender Related Party.
