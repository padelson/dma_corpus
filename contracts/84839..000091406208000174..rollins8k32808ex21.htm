ARTICLE 3

 

 

PURCHASE PRICE; ADJUSTMENTS; ALLOCATIONS

 

 

3.1 Purchase Price. Subject to the adjustments, terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including without limitation, Section 3.2, the
aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the Purchased Assets
shall be an amount equal to One Hundred Thirty Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($132,500,000), plus or minus, as the case may be, any
adjustments pursuant to Section 3.2, and shall be paid by Purchaser or
its Affiliates to Sellers as follows:

 

 

(a) Cash at Closing. At Closing, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall pay
One Hundred Thirty Four Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($134,600,000)
(which amount reflects an initial increase to the Purchase Price equal to
$5,100,000, based upon the calculation of the Estimated Net Asset Value by
Purchaser and Sellers prior to the date hereof as described in Section 3.2(a)
below), plus fifty percent (50%) of Sellers' actual out-of-pocket costs for
preparing the Audited Financial Statements as described in Section 6.4, minus
fifty percent (50%) of the filing fees paid by Purchaser in connection with
the HSR filings described in Section 6.7 (collectively, the "Closing
Payment"), to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account(s) designated in writing by Sellers no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Indemnity Escrow. At Closing, cash constituting a portion of
the Purchase Price in the amount of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) (the
"Indemnity Escrow") shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account as
security for Sellers' indemnity obligations set forth in this Agreement. The
terms and conditions for the release or forfeiture of the Indemnity Escrow
are more particularly set forth in that certain Indemnity Escrow Agreement
which shall be executed and delivered by Purchaser, Sellers and the escrow
agent at Closing substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1(b)
(the "Indemnity Escrow Agreement"); provided that within one (1) Business
Day following the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Escrow Agent shall deliver to Sellers any amounts remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow account, less any amounts that are the subject of a Claim Notice (as
defined in the Escrow Agreement) delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to 5:00
p.m. Eastern Time on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date
which has not been resolved ("Disputed Amounts") pursuant to the terms set
forth in the Escrow Agreement, such resolution to be evidenced by a written
instrument signed by Sellers and Purchaser and delivered to the Escrow Agent.
Within one (1) Business Day after the resolution of a dispute as to any
Disputed Amounts pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall release (A) to Purchaser the amount, if any, payable to the
Purchaser in connection with such resolved Disputed Amounts and (B) to
Sellers, the remaining balance of the Indemnity Escrow plus all
accrued interest thereon, minus any remaining Disputed Amounts.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(a) In addition to the payment of the Purchase Price, as consideration for
the sale, conveyance, assignment, delivery and transfer of the Purchased
Assets, Purchaser shall assume the Assumed Liabilities.

 



 

3.2 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

 

 

(a) Estimated Net Asset Value. Prior to the date hereof, Sellers and
Purchaser jointly prepared a calculation of the Estimated Net Asset Value by
adjusting the unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of Shareholder as of
February 29, 2008 that was provided to Purchaser by Sellers (the "February
2008 Balance Sheet") to (A) reflect the increase to the goodwill of the
Business resulting from the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of
Pest Management of Richmond, Inc., (B) remove reserves for claims and
litigation that are to be retained by Sellers as contemplated by Section
2.3(b) above, (C) fully accrue, to the extent not already accrued, all
amounts owed with respect to the Assumed Liabilities for the obligations to
make outstanding payments, including contingent payments, pursuant to
Contracts involving the purchase by any Seller of all or substantially all of
the assets or capital stock of any other Person, (D) reflect substantive
adjustments that have arisen as of the date hereof from the preparation of
the Audited Financial Statements as contemplated by Section 6.4 (except no
such adjustment shall be made with respect to recognition of termite renewal
revenue), (E) reflect the historical fiscal year-end practices of
Sellers, (F) remove accounts receivable that are to be retained by Sellers
as contemplated by Section 2.2(n) above and (G) reflect the other
substantive adjustments that were agreed to by the Parties prior to the date
hereof (as adjusted, the "Pre-Closing Calculation"). The Pre-Closing
Calculation is attached as Exhibit 3.2(a). Sellers represent and warrant that
the February 2008 Balance Sheet was prepared from the books and records of
Sellers in accordance with GAAP (subject to the absence of footnotes thereto
and any other exceptions set forth in Schedule 4.7), applied consistently
with the Balance Sheet. "Estimated Net Asset Value" means the estimated Net
Asset Value of Sellers, as shown in the Pre-Closing Calculation, which the
Parties agree to be $92,000,000.

 

 

(b) Closing Balance Sheet.

 

 

(i) Delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser, with the reasonable input, review and approval of
Sellers, shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers (i) an
unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of Shareholder as of March 31, 2008
(the "Closing Balance Sheet"), and (ii) a calculation of the Net Asset Value
prepared in a manner consistent with the Pre-Closing Calculation, which shall
include adjustments for the items set forth in Items (A) - (G) in Section
3.2(a) above (without duplication for any such matters that are addressed in
the Closing Balance Sheet) (the "Closing Calculation"). Purchaser represents
and warrants that upon delivery to Sellers, the Closing Balance Sheet shall
have been prepared from the books and records of Sellers and the Business in
accordance with GAAP (subject to the absence of footnotes thereto), applied
consistently with the Audited Financial Statements (subject to the historical
fiscal year-end practices of Sellers).

 

 

(ii) Final Closing Balance Sheet. From the Closing Date through the date of
the payment provided for in Section 3.2(d), Purchaser shall give Sellers
reasonable access during normal business hours to the books and records, the
accounting and other appropriate personnel and the independent accountants of
the Business and Purchaser (including access to each of the specific items of
information described in Exhibit 3.2(b)) in order to enable Sellers to
review the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Calculation. Within ninety
(90) days after the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Calculation, Sellers shall have completed a review of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Calculation. After such review, if Sellers and
Purchaser reach agreement on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Calculation, such balance sheet shall be the "Final Closing Balance Sheet"
and such calculation of Net Asset Value shall be the "Final
Closing Calculation." If however, Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach
agreement on the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Calculation
within thirty (30) days after the end of such 90-day period, then the parties
shall submit the items in dispute (but no other matters) to KPMG LLP, or such
other "Big Four" public accounting firm as is mutually acceptable to the
parties hereto (the "Accountants") for resolution. Such resolution by the
Accountants shall be set forth in a written report ("Accountants
Report"), setting forth its determination of all items in dispute, together
with the resulting calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value and a
reasonably detailed explanation of work performed by the Accountants,
delivered by the Accountants to the parties hereto within thirty (30) days
following the submission of such dispute to the Accountants, and the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Calculation as modified in accordance with the
Accountants Report shall be the "Final Closing Balance Sheet" and the "Final
Closing Calculation", respectively, and shall be final and binding upon
the parties hereto, absent fraud or manifest error. The Net Asset Value of
Sellers determined pursuant to the Final Closing Calculation shall be
the "Closing Net Asset Value". The fees charged by the Accountants shall be
paid 50% by Sellers and 50% by Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) For purposes hereof, "Net Asset Value" means, in respect of Sellers, on
a consolidated basis, eliminating the effect of any transactions or
arrangements between Sellers and/or any of their Affiliates other than trade
accounts receivable owing from any Affiliates of Sellers, the book value of
the Purchased Assets, as adjusted for amortization and depreciation, less the
book value of the Assumed Liabilities. All calculations of "Net Asset
Value" hereunder shall be made by excluding deferred income taxes and shall
include all deferred charges that relate to the ongoing operations and that
benefit Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments proposed
by EandY for the preparation of the Audited Financial Statements solely
in respect of the recognition of termite renewal revenue, whether or not
accepted by Sellers, shall not be made in the preparation of the Pre-Closing
Calculation or the Final Closing Calculation pursuant to this Section 3.2.

 

 

(d) Final Closing Net Asset Value Adjustment. In the event that the Closing
Net Asset Value exceeds the Estimated Net Asset Value, then Purchaser shall
pay Sellers cash in the amount of such excess. In the event that the Closing
Net Asset Value is less than Estimated Net Asset Value, then Sellers shall
pay Purchaser cash in the amount of such shortfall. All payments under this
Section 3.2(d) shall be made within five (5) days following the date on which
the Final Closing Balance Sheet and Final Closing Calculation are finally
determined pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(ii) by either check (if requested by
the receiving Party) or wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as is specified by such Party at least two (2) Business Days prior to
the due date for such payment. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
3.2(d) shall include an additional amount of simple interest at the rate of
six percent (6%) per annum (based on a 365 day year) from the Closing Date
through the date of such payment.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.3 Allocation of Certain Items. With respect to certain expenses
incurred with respect to the Purchased Assets in the operation of the
Business, the following allocations shall be made between Purchaser and
Sellers:

 

 

(a) Taxes. For all taxable periods that begin on or prior to the Effective
Time, real, personal and ad valorem property Taxes and any similar Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis ("Periodic Taxes"), with respect to the
Purchased Assets or the Business, shall be apportioned between Sellers and
Purchaser based upon the number of days in the taxable period prior to the
Effective Time and in the taxable period beginning on and following the
Effective Time, respectively, except that Periodic Taxes to the extent and in
the amount accrued or reserved against on the Final Closing Balance Sheet
shall be apportioned entirely to Purchaser.

 

 

(b) Utilities. Utilities, water and sewer charges shall be apportioned based
upon the number of days occurring prior to the Effective Time and beginning
on and following the Effective Time during the billing period for each such
charge, except that such charges to the extent and in the amount accrued or
reserved against on the Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be apportioned
entirely to Purchaser.

 

 

3.4 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Filing of Tax Returns. With respect to any and all Taxes other than
Periodic Taxes, (i) Sellers shall be solely responsible for and shall pay,
without any cost to Purchaser, Taxes assessed against and payable by Sellers,
arising from the operations of the Business or use of the Purchased Assets
before the Closing Date (regardless of whether the filing of any Tax Return
with respect thereto or payment of any amount in respect thereof is filed,
paid or due prior to, on or after the Closing Date); and (ii) Purchaser shall
be solely responsible for and shall pay, without any cost to Sellers, Taxes
assessed against and payable by Purchaser, arising from the operations of the
Business or use of the Purchased Assets after the Closing Date, and any other
Taxes to the extent such Taxes are reflected on the Final Closing Balance
Sheet.

 

 

(b) Cooperation. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Parties
hereby agree that each of them shall, in connection with Taxes relating to
the Purchased Assets or the Business: (i) cooperate with the other in
executing or causing to be executed any required Tax document; (ii) make
available to the other, as promptly as practicable, all work papers, records
and notes of any kind at all reasonable times for the purpose of allowing the
appropriate Party to complete Tax Returns, participate in a proceeding,
obtain Tax refunds, make any determination required under this Agreement or
defend or prosecute Tax claims; (iii) make available to the other, as
reasonably requested and available, personnel responsible for preparing or
maintaining information, records and documents in connection with Taxes as
well as any related litigation; (iv) preserve all such information, records,
and documents until the expiration of any applicable statutes of limitation
or extensions thereof and as otherwise required by law; and (v) provide
timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened Tax audits
or assessments for periods beginning on or prior to the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date and furnish the other with copies of
all correspondence received from any Governmental Entity in connection with
any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such period.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Employment Tax. Purchaser and Sellers agree that they will follow
the standard procedure of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-2, C.B. 320, whereby each
shall be solely responsible for employment tax reporting for employees who
may be employed by each of them in the calendar year that includes the
Closing Date. Sellers shall provide Purchaser with such employment tax
information as Purchaser shall reasonably request in connection with
Purchaser's employment tax reporting obligations for the portion of the
calendar year following the Closing.

 

 

(d) Purchase Price Allocation. At the time that Sellers cause the Closing
Balance Sheet to be delivered to Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(i),
Sellers shall also cause to be delivered to Purchaser an allocation of the
applicable portion of the Purchase Price and other relevant items (including,
for example, adjustments to Purchase Price) among the Purchased Assets,
including goodwill and other assets, in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and any comparable
provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate, prepared with the
reasonable input, review and approval of Purchaser (the
"Preliminary Allocation"). Approval of the Preliminary Allocation
by Purchaser, and the resolution of any disagreement regarding the
Preliminary Allocation, shall be subject to the same time restrictions and
procedures as applicable to the finalization of the Closing Balance Sheet,
pursuant to Section 3.2(b)(ii). The allocation agreed to by the Parties or
determined by the Accountants, as the case may be, shall be the
"Final Allocation." The Final Allocation shall be binding on the Parties, to
the extent permitted by Law. The Parties shall prepare and timely file all
applicable federal and state income Tax forms (including Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation,
cooperate with each other in the preparation of such forms, and furnish each
other with a copy of the final version of Form 8594 within a reasonable
period before the filing date thereof. Except as otherwise required pursuant
to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or
any comparable provision of any state, local or foreign law), none of the
Parties shall take a position inconsistent with the Final Allocation on any
Tax Return (including any forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060

selling expenses, and Purchaser and Sellers will unilaterally allocate such
expenses appropriately.

received by Purchaser or its Affiliates or successors, relating to Taxes for
which Purchaser or its Affiliates have paid (without reimbursement from

(or for which Sellers have reimbursed Purchaser), shall be for the account
of Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers any such amount, within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt thereof. Sellers shall be entitled
to request that Purchaser, at Sellers' expense, file for and obtain any Tax

jurisdiction in which the character or location of the properties owned,

hereby, (ii) subject to applicable Law, if practicable, permit the other such
party to review in advance any proposed written, oral or electronic
communication to the Antitrust Authorities and incorporate the other such
party's reasonable comments, (iii) not agree to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Antitrust Authority in respect of
any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably
practicable, it consults with the other such party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by the Antitrust Authorities, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend, and (iv) furnish the other party with copies of
all correspondence, filings and written communications between it and its
Affiliates and their respective authorized representatives on the one hand
and any Antitrust Authority or its respective staff on the other, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Sellers and Purchaser shall each be responsible for the payment of fifty
(50%) of all filing fees under the HSR Act, regardless of whether this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 9 before the Closing occurs. Each
of Purchaser and Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of its and
its Affiliates' own expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses,
in complying with any request for additional information or documentary
material from any Antitrust Authority.

 

 

6.8 Consents. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an attempt by
Sellers to assign any Non-Assignable Contract without the necessary notice to
or consent, authorization or approval of the other party or parties thereto.
Sellers shall, during the remaining term of each Non-Assignable Contract, use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain the consent of the applicable
third party, (b) to the extent not prohibited by such Non-Assignable
Contract, make the benefits of each such Non-Assignable Contracts available
to Purchaser following the Closing so long as Purchaser fully cooperates with
Sellers, promptly reimburses Sellers for all payments made by Sellers in
connection therewith and fully performs when due all obligation of any Seller
thereunder in accordance with the terms of such Non-Assignable Contract, and
(c) enforce following the Closing, at the request of Purchaser and at the
expense and for the account of Purchaser, any right of Sellers arising from
such Non-Assignable Contracts against the other party or parties thereto
(including the right to terminate any such Non-Assignable Contract in
accordance with the terms thereof). Sellers acknowledge and agree that for
purposes of obtaining the consents of the applicable third parties to the
assignment of the Non-Assignable Contracts, it shall be deemed commercially
reasonable for the applicable Seller to remain liable for its obligations
under a Non-Assignable Contract if Purchaser has used its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Seller in getting released from such liability,
but notwithstanding such efforts the applicable third party will not agree to
such release. As between Sellers and Purchaser, Purchaser will be deemed to
have assumed Sellers' performance of obligations for any such Non-Assignable
Contract as an Assumed Liability provided Sellers have made the benefits of
such Non-Assignable Contract available to Purchaser. With respect to any such
Non-Assignable Contract as to which the necessary approval or consent for the
assignment or transfer to Purchaser is obtained following the Closing, at
such time as consent or approval has been obtained, the related Assigned
Contract shall be assigned or transferred to Purchaser automatically without
any other conveyance or other action by Purchaser.

with covenants, terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit 6.9.

(including any penalties or interest thereon) payable as a result of the
Acquisition or any other action contemplated by this Agreement (other than
any federal, state, local or foreign Taxes measured by or based upon income
or gains imposed upon the Parties), and will be paid fifty percent (50%) by
Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. All other fees and expenses
necessary to cause the transfer of the Purchased Assets hereunder (including
any amounts paid to third parties to secure any necessary consents and
approvals as required herein) will be paid by Purchaser. The Parties will
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding Taxes and all
transfer, recording, registration and other fees that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Intellectual Property or Centex Assigned IP, or any name derived from or
confusingly similar to any such names. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers
shall be entitled to use the following corporate names: "CHS, LLC", "HTPD,
Inc." and "HTPD, LLC." Within ninety (90) days following the Closing
Date, Sellers shall file in all jurisdictions in which they are qualified to
do business any documents necessary to reflect such change of name or to
terminate its qualification therein. In connection with enabling Purchaser,
as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, to use the current
corporate name of Sellers, Sellers shall execute and deliver to Purchaser all
consents related to such change of name as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser.

 

 

6.13 Bulk Sales. Purchaser hereby waives compliance by Sellers with
the provisions of any applicable state bulk transfer statutes.

 

 

6.14 Risk of Loss. All risk of loss or damage to or destruction of
the Purchased Assets, in whole or in part, shall be and remain with Sellers
until the Closing; provided, however, that from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall be deemed to bear all risk of loss or damage to or
destruction of the Purchased Assets, in whole or in part, for the time period
commencing at the Effective Time.

 

 

6.15 Qualified Termite Contracts. The Parties covenant and agree that

of the Business to perform all service and warranty obligations thereunder
from and after the Effective Time; provided, that as between Purchaser and

for such performance by the Business. Purchaser shall promptly provide
Sellers notice with respect of any claim in excess of $10,000 made by the
other party or parties to a Qualified Termite Contract with respect to the
service and warranty obligations thereunder. Within twenty (20) days of
receipt of such notice (which period shall toll during any period in which
Purchaser is in breach of Section 6.17), Sellers shall either (i) direct
Purchaser in writing to pay the amount claimed or perform the necessary
obligations in connection therewith, in which case Sellers shall reimburse
Purchaser for all of Purchaser's out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, court costs, expert witness fees, transcript costs and other
expenses of litigation to defend against such claims) to perform such service
and warranty obligations, including the initial $10,000 of such claims, (ii)
notify Purchaser in writing that Sellers have elected to defend such claim,
in which event Sellers will be liable for all amounts owed with respect to
such claim, or (iii) direct Purchaser in writing to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such claim, in which event Sellers
shall reimburse Purchaser, when billed, for its reasonable out-of-pocket
costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, expert witness
fees, transcript costs and other expenses of litigation to defend against
such claims) of defending such claim and shall promptly reimburse Purchaser
for the full amount, if any, paid to the claimant upon resolution of such
claim. In the event Sellers fail to respond in writing within such twenty
(20) day period which period shall toll during any period in which Purchaser
is in breach of Section 6.17), Sellers shall be deemed to have directed
Purchaser to pay the amount claimed or perform the necessary obligations in
connection therewith, and will promptly reimburse Purchaser for all of
Purchaser's out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, expert witness fees, transcript costs and other expenses of litigation
to defend against such claims) to perform such service and warranty
obligations or defend such claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section
6.15 to the contrary, Sellers shall have no liability under this Section 6.15
with respect to (i) any Assumed Liabilities described in Sections 2.3(a)(v)
or (ii) any Qualified Termite Contract after the customer thereunder makes a
renewal payment to Purchaser, and the renewal period for which such payment
was made has commenced. In addition, to the extent not inconsistent with
this Section 6.15, the Parties agree that the provisions of Section 10.8
shall apply to any claims described in this Section 6.15 and references to
indemnification, indemnified party and indemnifying party shall be deemed
references to the reimbursement obligations in this Section 6.15, Purchaser
and Sellers, respectively.

prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction; (ii) Purchaser
shall allow Sellers and their agents reasonable access to and to copy, for
any proper purpose, including for making any tax or regulatory filing, all
Books and Records, at Sellers' expense; provided, however, that Sellers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to see that any such access

interfere with the normal conduct of the businesses of Purchaser; and (iii)
Purchaser shall make available to Sellers upon written request the personnel
of Purchaser to assist Sellers in locating and obtaining any Books

jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege available
to Purchaser or contravene any applicable Law and (B) to the extent that any
Books and Records or other information are withheld from Sellers pursuant to

other information in a manner that would not jeopardize any such privilege.

normal conduct of Sellers' and such Affiliate's businesses; and (iii) Sellers
and their Affiliates shall make available to Purchaser upon
reasonable written request Sellers' and its Affiliates' personnel to assist

their Affiliates to disclose any information to Purchaser if such disclosure
would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege available to
Sellers or their Affiliates or contravene any applicable Law and (B) to the
extent that any Seller Books and Records or other information are withheld
from Purchaser pursuant to clause (A) above because disclosure thereof would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege, Sellers

alternative arrangements to provide to Purchaser any factual information
contained in such Seller Books and Records or other information in a manner
that would not jeopardize any such privilege.

proceeding or investigation is pending or threatened at the termination of

plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act or transaction
involving the Business or the Purchased Assets, in each case including any
action that is the subject of Article 10 (other than a Direct Claim), the
other Parties will cooperate with such Party and its counsel in the contest
or defense (including, without limitation, assisting or participating
in discovery activities including depositions, interrogatories or requests
for production), make available the appropriate personnel of such Party and
its Affiliates, and provide such testimony and access to its books and
records and any documents or information relating to such claim or legal

such Party without undue cost or expense as promptly as possible and as shall
be reasonably necessary in connection with the contest or defense. If

assistance being provided by any other Party pursuant to this Section 6.17,
such party shall so notify the other Parties. If within ten (10) days after

level of cooperation and assistance, then it shall so notify the
other Parties. Within three (3) Business Days after the delivery of
such second notice, the then-current President of Orkin, Inc. and the then-

to work together in good faith to resolve the matter.

irrevocably released and discharged, Purchaser shall (i) not increase, renew
or materially modify any outstanding Bond and LOC Obligation without Sellers'
prior written consent and (ii) comply with all terms and conditions included
in or relating to any outstanding Bond and LOC Obligation. In addition,
Purchaser acknowledges that neither Sellers, nor any of their Affiliates,

(a) in writing by mutual consent of the Parties;

 

 

(b) by written notice from Sellers to Purchaser, if (i) Purchaser fails to

Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior to the Closing, (ii)
Rollins fails to perform in any material respect its obligations contained in
Sections 3 or 4 of the Letter of Intent required to be performed by it prior

and warranties contained in this Agreement, in each case, in which such
failure or breach (A) would have a material adverse effect on the Purchaser's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date, would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.3, or (C) is incapable

notified Purchaser of their intent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(b);

 

 

(c) by written notice from Purchaser to Sellers, if (i) Sellers fail to

Closing Date, would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in

satisfy the conditions to the other Party's obligations to close set forth in
Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 other than any conditions to be satisfied through the
making of payments or delivery of documents at Closing, as applicable)

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Article 9, this Agreement shall be terminated and
become void and have no effect, and there shall be no liability hereunder on

(a) Subject to Section 10.6, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify

"Purchaser Indemnitees") and agree to reimburse and hold them harmless from
and against, and in respect of, on a dollar for dollar basis, all

law or in equity) (collectively, "Losses") incurred or suffered by any of
them and arising out of or resulting from any of the following:

 

 

(i) any breach of, nonfulfillment of, or failure to perform any agreement or
covenant of any Seller or any of their Affiliates contained herein or in any
of the Seller Ancillary Documents;

 

 

(ii) any breach of any warranty or representation of any Seller or any of

to Section 8.1(b) are made only as of the date hereof and as of the

Time Representations and Warranties as certified by Sellers pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) shall be deemed to be made only as of the date hereof and
as of the Effective Time (other than those made as of a specified date, which
are made as of such specified date), but not as of the Closing (and
references in such certificate to the Closing or Closing Date shall be deemed
to refer to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section 10.1(a)(ii)) and
(D) for purposes of this Section 10.1, all representations and warranties in

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) any and all Excluded Liabilities, regardless of whether the existence
or assertion of an Excluded Liability constitutes a breach of any warranty,
representation, or covenant of any Seller or any of their Affiliates
contained in this Agreement or in any Seller Ancillary Document;

 

 

(iv) all Environmental Claims with respect to Sellers' facilities in Winton-
Salem, North Carolina, Winter Garden, Florida, Bakersfield, California and

obligations (other than Assumed Liabilities) arising out of or resulting from
any casualty, damage, event or condition in respect of the Purchased Assets
or the Business first existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time and
that continue through and after the Effective Time, which pro rata portion
shall be calculated based upon the number of days prior to the Effective Time
on which such casualty, damage, event or condition existed and continued,
divided by the total number of days on which such casualty, damage, event or
condition existed and continued (collectively, with all other indemnification
obligations of Sellers contained in this Section 10.1, the "Section 10.1
Indemnified Claims").

 

 

(b) Solely for the purposes of the indemnification obligations of Sellers
pursuant to Article 10, in order to determine whether a breach of any
representation or warranty of Sellers has occurred, all Materiality
Qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded; provided, however, that there shall not be disregarded any
Materiality Qualifications which are included in Section 4.7 or Section
4.9(a) or solely to the extent such Materiality Qualification modifies the
identification on a schedule of a list of material Permits in Section
4.11(b).

 

 

10.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 10.6, Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers and their
respective Affiliates, and their respective employees, officers, directors,

suffered by any of them and arising out of or resulting from any of the

pursuant to Article 10, in order to determine whether a breach of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser has occurred, all Materiality
Qualifications contained in any such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.3 Provisions Regarding Indemnification.

 

 

(a) The indemnified party (or parties) shall promptly notify the indemnifying
party (or parties) of any third-party claim, demand, action or proceeding for
which indemnification will or may be sought under Sections 10.1 or 10.2 (a
"Third Party Claim"), but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after
receiving notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that
the failure to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve the
indemnifying party from liability hereunder in respect of such claim except
to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced as a result of such
failure, including where failure results in losses to the indemnifying party
or the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses that would otherwise be
available in the defense of such claim. Such notice shall specify facts
reasonably known to the indemnified party (or parties) giving rise to such
indemnity rights. The indemnifying party will have the right, at its
expense, to assume the defense thereof using counsel reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party elects not to assume
the defense or fails to notify the indemnified party, within ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of the indemnified party's notice of such Third
Party Claim (which period shall toll during any period in which the
indemnified party is in breach of Section 6.17 in respect of such claim),
that it will assume the defense, then the indemnified party may employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party to represent or
defend it against any such Third Party Claim and the indemnifying party will
pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel; provided, however,
that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any legal
proceeding or any separate but substantially similar legal proceedings
arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all
indemnified persons, except to the extent that local counsel, in addition to
its regular counsel, is required in order to effectively defend against such
legal proceeding. If the indemnifying party does assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall have no obligation in respect
of the indemnified party's expenses; provided, that the indemnified party
shall have the right to participate in, at its own expense, but not control,
the defense of any such Third Party Claim. In connection with any Third Party
Claim, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith, in such
manner to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of
all business records and the attorney-client, work-product and any other
potentially applicable privileges and to render each other assistance as they
may reasonably require. No Third Party Claim shall be settled (i) without the
prior written consent of the indemnifying party and (ii) without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party unless such settlement provides for
no relief other than the payment of monetary damages for which the relevant
indemnified parties will be indemnified in full; provided, however, that if
a firm, written offer is made to settle any Third Party Claim and the
indemnifying party proposes to accept such settlement and the indemnified
party refuses to consent to such settlement, then: (i) the indemnifying party
shall be excused from, and the indemnified party shall be solely responsible
for, all further defense of such Third Party Claim; and (ii) the maximum
liability of the indemnifying party relating to such Third Party Claim shall
be the amount of the proposed settlement if the amount thereafter recovered
from the indemnified party on such Third Party Claim is greater than the
amount of the proposed settlement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) To the extent a dispute exists between the indemnified party (or parties)
and the applicable indemnifying party (or parties), with respect to a claim
for which indemnification will or may be sought under Sections 10.1 or 10.2
(but excluding Third Party Claims) (a "Direct Claim"), the indemnified party
shall give written notice ("Direct Claim Notice") to the indemnifying party.
Such notice shall specify the facts reasonably known to the indemnified party
(or parties) giving rise to such indemnity rights. If the indemnifying party,
within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Direct Claim Notice by such
indemnified party, shall not give written notice to such indemnified party
announcing such indemnifying party's intent to contest such assertion by the
indemnified party, such assertion shall be deemed accepted and the amount of
such claim shall be deemed a valid claim and the indemnifying party shall
promptly pay (except as provided in Section 10.5, and subject to the
limitations of Section 10.6) the amount of such claim to the indemnified
party. If the indemnifying party, within thirty (30) days after the delivery
of the Direct Claim Notice by such indemnified party, shall give notice that
it contests such assertion by the indemnified party, such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with this Agreement.

 

 

10.4 Survival. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
and in the Seller Ancillary Documents and the Purchaser Ancillary Documents
shall survive for a period of (18) months following the Closing Date, and
shall thereafter cease to be of any force and effect and there will
thereafter be no liability for indemnity with respect to breaches of such
representations and warranties, except for (a) claims as to which notice has
been given in accordance with Section 10.3 hereof prior to such date and
which are pending on such date, (b) claims based upon representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4.1 (Due Organization, Good Standing and
Corporate Power), Section 4.2 (Authorization; Enforceability), Section 5.1
(Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power) and Section 5.2
(Authorization; Enforceability), which shall survive without limitation, (c)
claims based upon representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.13
(Tax Returns; Taxes), which shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, and (d) claims based
upon representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.17 (Environmental,
Health and Safety Matters), which shall survive for a period of four (4)
years following the Closing Date. Neither such survival nor the liability of
any Party with respect to the Party's representations and warranties shall
be reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of
any Party. All indemnification obligations of any Party herein
shall expressly survive the Closing.

 

 

10.5 Set-Off. Except with respect to amounts owed by Sellers under Section
3.2(d), if any, for which Purchaser shall have no obligation (and Sellers
shall have no right) to set-off such amounts against the Indemnity Escrow,
all amounts otherwise payable by Sellers to any of the Purchaser Indemnitees
for any Section 10.1 Indemnified Claims shall be satisfied first by set-off
against the Indemnity Escrow, in accordance with the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement, and second, to the extent all amounts then remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow have been exhausted (either through distribution or pending
claims) or released to Sellers, by Sellers, subject to the limitations
provided in Section 10.6 hereof. Subject to Section 10.7, the Indemnity
Escrow and the right of set-off shall not be exclusive of any other right or
remedy any of the Purchaser Indemnitees may have with respect to Section 10.1
Indemnified Claims, whether under this Agreement, the Centex Guaranty, at law
or in equity.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.6 Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement or any of the Seller Ancillary Documents or Purchaser
Ancillary Documents to the contrary:

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to the contrary (but subject
to Section 10.6(b)), no Seller shall have any liability under this Article 10
or obligation to provide indemnification for any Losses asserted by any
Purchaser Indemnitee under Section 10.1(a)(ii), under Section 10.1(a)(i) in
respect of a Pre-Closing Covenant or under Section 10.1(a)(iii), (iv) or (v)
with respect to Direct Claims (each a "Covered Claim", and collectively, the
"Covered Claims") until the aggregate amount of Losses arising out of such
Covered Claims equals or exceeds an amount equal to One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) (the "Liability Threshold"), and then only to the extent such
Losses exceed an amount equal to Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($750,000) (the "Deductible"); provided, however, that claims based upon
actual fraud shall not be subject to such Liability Threshold and Deductible.
Once the Liability Threshold is exceeded, (i) the Environmental Threshold
shall cease to apply for purposes of Section 10.6(b) and (ii) no Seller shall
have any liability under this Article 10 or obligation to provide
indemnification for any Losses arising from a specific breach giving rise to
a Covered Claim until such Losses arising from such specific breach equals or
exceeds $10,000, in which case Sellers shall be liable under this Article 10
for the full amount of Losses arising from the applicable breach giving rise
to the Covered Claim.

 

 

(b) With respect to Environmental Claims, no Seller shall have any liability
under this Article 10 or obligation to provide indemnification for any Losses
asserted by any Purchaser Indemnitee under Section 10.1(a)(ii) or under
Section 10.1(a)(iii) or (iv) with respect to Direct Claims (each an
"Environmental Covered Claim", and collectively, the "Environmental
Covered Claims") until the aggregate amount of such Losses arising out of
such Environmental Covered Claims equals or exceeds an amount equal to Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "Environmental Threshold"), and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Environmental Threshold. The
amount of all Losses credited against the Environmental Threshold pursuant to
this Section 10.6(b) up to, but not exceeding, the Environmental Threshold
will also be credited against the Liability Threshold for purposes of Section
10.6(a).

 

 

(c) Except for any liabilities resulting from actual fraud or from claims
for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(ii) based upon
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.13 (Tax Returns;
Taxes), Sellers' aggregate liability for Losses asserted by any Purchaser
Indemnitees for any Covered Claims shall not exceed Twelve Million Dollars
($12,000,000) (the "Maximum Amount"); provided, that the Maximum Amount
shall be reduced in accordance with paragraph (c) of Schedule 6.21.

 

 

(d) All amounts paid by or on behalf of Sellers as indemnification shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price, except as required by
applicable law.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to the contrary, Purchaser
shall not have any liability under this Article 10 or obligation to provide
indemnification for any Losses asserted by any Seller Indemnitees under
Section 10.2(a)(ii) or under Section 10.2(a)(iii) with respect to Direct
Claims (each a "Purchaser Covered Claim", and collectively, the "Purchaser
Covered Claims") unless and until the aggregate amount of such Losses arising
out of such Purchaser Covered Claims equals or exceeds an amount equal to
the Liability Threshold, and then only to the extent such Losses exceed
the Deductible; provided, however, that claims based upon actual fraud shall
not be subject to such Liability Threshold. Once the Liability Threshold is
exceeded with respect to Losses incurred by Seller Indemnitees, Purchaser
shall have no liability under this Article 10 or obligation to provide
indemnification for any Losses arising from a specific breach giving rise to
a Purchaser Covered Claim until such Losses arising from such specific breach
equals or exceeds $10,000, in which case Purchaser shall be liable under this
Article 10 for the full amount of Losses arising from the applicable breach
giving rise to the Purchaser Covered Claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Except for any liabilities resulting from actual fraud, Purchaser's
aggregate liability for Losses asserted by any Seller Indemnitees for any
Purchaser Covered Claims shall not exceed the amount of the Purchase Price
paid to Sellers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 10,
amounts that can be shown to be (i) accrued or reserved against on the Final
Closing Balance Sheet with respect to certain events or conditions, and that
were thereby taken into account in determining the Final Closing Calculation
or (ii) otherwise included in the Final Closing Calculation to reduce the
purchase price pursuant to Section 3.2, shall not be included in any Losses
claimed by any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to such events or condition
to the extent and in the amount so accrued, reserved or otherwise taken into
account in the Final Closing Calculation.

 

 

(h) The Parties shall be entitled to pursue without limitation any rights or
remedies they may have with respect to claims based upon actual fraud,
whether under this Agreement, at law or in equity.

 

 

(i) In no event shall any Party be liable for special, punitive, exemplary,
incidental, consequential or indirect damages, lost profits, diminution in
value, damage to reputation or loss to goodwill, whether based in contract,
tort, strict liability or otherwise, except to the extent awarded in Third-
Party Claims.

 

 

(j) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 10 to the contrary, Sellers
shall have no liability under this Article 10 or obligation to provide
indemnification for any Losses asserted by any Purchaser Indemnitee which are
the subject of Section 6.15, 6.20 or 6.21 (except that the remedies provided
in Section 10.1(a)(i) shall be available to the extent that Sellers breach
their obligations under Section 6.15, 6.20 or 6.21).

 

 

10.7 Exclusive Remedy. Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
Law (pursuant to statutory or other provisions that cannot be waived by
the parties), from and after the Closing, the provisions contained herein
with respect to the final determination and payment of the Purchase Price
(including the provisions of Section 3.1 and 3.2) and the provisions this
Article 10 shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties for
all matters covered or contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall limit the right of any party to seek specific
performance or injunctive relief in connection with a breach by another party
of its obligations under this Agreement that occurs after the Closing Date.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.8 Mitigation; Insurance. In the case of any Third Party Claims that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under
Article 10, if there is a reasonable likelihood that such indemnified party
may have a direct or indirect right of recovery against one or more third
parties (including rights of recovery under insurance policies or
indemnification arrangements with subcontractors or other third parties), (i)
the indemnified party shall promptly notify the indemnifying party of such
right of recovery, (ii) the indemnified party shall pursue enforcement of
such right of recovery for so long as the pursuit thereof is commercially
reasonable, with the determination of whether the pursuit of litigation is
commercially reasonable to be in the sole discretion of the indemnified
party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified
party in connection with the enforcement of such right of recovery as
contemplated by clause (ii) above. To the extent that an indemnified party
obtains recovery in respect of any such Third Party Claims from any third
parties, the amount of any losses with respect to any Third Party Claim for
which indemnification is available under this Article 10 shall be reduced by
the amount of such insurance proceeds or other such funds realized or paid to
the indemnified party, net of any applicable deductible or self-insurance
retention and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred by such
indemnified party in obtaining such recovery. If, after the making of any
payment in respect of a Third Party Claim under this Article 10, the amount
of the losses to which such payment relates is reduced by
recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant
to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person,
the amount of such reduction will promptly be repaid by the indemnified party
to the indemnifying party, net of all reasonable fees and expenses incurred
by such party in obtaining such recovery. Each indemnified party shall
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its losses upon and after
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any losses.

in any of the Schedules delivered by such party of any facts or circumstances
shall not be deemed to be adequate disclosure of such facts or circumstances
with respect to any other representations or warranties made by such party,

11.3 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such
prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction will not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of Law that renders
any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

 

 

11.4 Modification and Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, modified
or supplemented except by written agreement of the Parties. Any agreement on
the part of a Party to any extension or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of the performance of any
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty shall
not be construed as a waiver of any other covenant, agreement, obligation,
condition, representation or warranty. A waiver by any Party of the
performance of any act will not constitute a waiver of the performance of any
other act or an identical act required to be performed at a later time.

 

 

11.5 Assignment; Successors in Interest. No assignment or transfer by any
Party of such Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement will be
made except with the prior written consent of the other Parties to this
Agreement; provided that Purchaser shall, without the obligation to obtain
the prior written consent of any other Party to this Agreement, be entitled
to assign this Agreement or all or any part of its rights or obligations
hereunder to one or more Affiliates of Purchaser. The terms and conditions
hereof shall survive the Closing and shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
and any reference to a Party shall also be a reference to the successors and
permitted assigns thereof.

 

 

11.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument, with the same effect
as if the signatures thereto were in the same instrument. Signature pages
exchanged by telefax or other electronic means shall be fully binding. This
Agreement shall be effective and binding on all of the Parties when all
Parties have executed and delivered a counterpart of this Agreement.

 

 

11.7 Captions. The titles, captions and table of contents contained in this
Agreement are inserted in this Agreement only as a matter of convenience and
for reference and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of
this Agreement or the intent of any provision of this Agreement.

11.8 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or implied in
this Agreement is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give any
Person other than the Parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, and
the indemnified parties (with respect to the provisions of Article 10), any
right, remedy, obligation or liability under or by reason of this Agreement,
or result in such Person being deemed a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement.

 

 

11.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Schedules
and Exhibits attached hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Seller
Ancillary Documents, the Purchaser Ancillary Documents, the Centex Guaranty
and the Rollins Guaranty constitute the entire agreement and supersede any
and all other prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
including the Letter of Intent except to the extent specifically set forth
therein.

 

 

11.10 Cooperation Following the Closing. Following the Closing, each Party
shall deliver to the other Parties such further information and documents and
shall execute and deliver to the other Parties such further instruments and
agreements as any other Party shall reasonably request to consummate or
confirm the transactions provided for in this Agreement, to accomplish the
purpose of this Agreement or to assure to any other Party the benefits of
this Agreement.

 

 

11.11 Governing Law. The interpretation and construction of this Agreement,
and all matters relating hereto, shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware applicable to agreements executed and to be performed solely
within such State.

 

 

11.12 Dispute Resolution. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, with the exception of disputes, controversies or claims which
are specifically prescribed to be resolved in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 3.2(b), or where the remedy sought is
specific performance or injunctive relief as described in Section 11.13
below, all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be resolved by
agreement among the Parties, or, if not so resolved, by binding arbitration.
Any Party may submit a dispute, controversy or claim to arbitration by
giving written notice to such effect, which notice shall describe, in
reasonable detail, the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the
filing Party's request for relief. If written notice of desire to arbitrate
is given by any of the Parties as provided above and the matter is not then
otherwise resolved by the Parties within forty-five (45) days after notice of
the dispute is given by one Party to the Parties, the Parties shall resort to
arbitration in accordance with Title 9 of the United States Code (the United
States Arbitration Act) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules, all as amended
from time to time (the "Rules") of the American Arbitration Association and
the provisions of this Section; provided, however, that the provisions of
this Section shall prevail in the event of any conflict with such Rules. The
Parties agree that they shall use their best efforts to cause the matter to
be presented to a panel of three arbitrators (at least one of whom shall have
at least ten years of industry experience relating to the subject matter of
the dispute) within thirty (30) days after the establishment of such panel.
Such panel shall consist of one arbitrator selected by Purchaser, one
arbitrator selected by Sellers, and a third arbitrator selected by the two
arbitrators so selected, who shall act as chairman of the panel; provided,
that each arbitrator shall be independent. Discovery shall be limited
to requests for admission and the request for and production of
documents, depositions and interrogatories, which discovery shall be
conducted in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Pending
the arbitration hearing, any provisional remedy that would be available to a
party from a court of law shall be available from the arbitration panel. The
decision of a majority of the arbitration panel with respect to the matters
referred to them pursuant hereto shall be final and binding upon the Parties,
subject to any rights of appeal under the Rules, and confirmation and
enforcement thereof may be rendered thereon by any court having jurisdiction
upon application of any person who is a party to the arbitration proceeding.
The costs and expenses incurred in the course of such arbitration, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, shall be borne by the Party or Parties against
whose favor the decisions and conclusions of the arbitration panel are
rendered; provided, however, that if the arbitration panel determines that
its decisions are not rendered wholly against the favor of one Party or
Parties or the other, the arbitration panel shall be authorized to apportion
such costs and expenses in the manner that it deems fair and just in light of
the merits of the dispute and its resolution. The arbitration panel shall
have no power or authority under this Agreement or otherwise to award or
provide for the award of punitive damages against any Party and the Parties
agree to eliminate punitive damages as a remedy, and waive any and all claims
for punitive damages based on punitive conduct. Any arbitration shall be
conducted in Dallas, Texas.

11.13 Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the other parties hereto may be irreparably damaged if any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that such other parties may
not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any party
hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled to seek to
enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
and to seek temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement,
without posting any bond or other undertaking.
