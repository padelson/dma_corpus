the aggregate sum of $140,750,000, as adjusted pursuant to SECTION 1.4 (the
"Purchase Price") payable as hereinafter provided and the Buyers shall assume
the Assumed Liabilities. The Buyers shall also assume certain leases and
other contracts and liabilities of the Sellers as set forth in SECTION
2.1(A).   (a) On the Closing Date, the Buyers shall pay an amount  in cash
to the Sellers equal to the Purchase Price less the sum of the  two items
listed below:   (i) $4,500,000, which amount will be delivered to  an
escrow agent, mutually acceptable to the parties (the "Escrow  Agent") to be
deposited into an escrow account (the "Escrow  Account") to pay (x) any
adjustments to the Purchase Price owed by  the Sellers pursuant to SECTION
1.4, (y) any Indemnity or other  amounts owed by the Sellers to the Buyers
pursuant to SECTION 12.1  hereof or under the Agreement of Purchase and Sale
of Assets,  dated March 30, 2001 between affiliates of the Buyers and
certain  Sellers (the "Utah Sale Agreement") or under the Agreement of 
Purchase and Sale of Assets, dated February 5, 2002, between  Oldcastle MMG
and certain Sellers (the "Idaho Sale Agreement", and  together with the Utah
Sale Agreement, the "Prior Asset Sale  Agreements"), all such indemnities to
be accorded administrative  priority upon entry of the Sale Order, and (z)
any amount owed  pursuant to SECTION 12.6 hereof. The funds in the Escrow
Account  shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the escrow agreement, the form of  which is
attached as EXHIBIT A (the "Escrow Agreement") after the  depletion of the
$500,000 deferred payment holdback provided in  the Idaho Sale Agreement (the
"Idaho Holdback"), and   (ii) the actual aggregate amount of the Cure
Costs  (as defined in SECTION 1.5(B)(I)).   (b) The parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that the  payment of the Purchase Price by the Buyers,
including the payments  required by SECTIONS 1.3(A)(I) and (II) and the
assumption of the Assumed  Liabilities, represent fair market value, based on
actual, arms-length  transactions, in consideration for the acquisition of
the Acquired  Assets.   1.4. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PURCHASE PRICE.   (a) The
Purchase Price shall be adjusted according to  whether the difference between
the Actual Working Capital (as defined  below) of the Sellers is more or less
than $26,000,000. The "Actual  Working Capital" shall be the sum of the book
values of (i) saleable  inventory, (ii) accounts and notes receivable MINUS
allowance for  doubtful accounts, and (iii) deposits in the nature of prepaid
expenses  and prepaid expenses, in each case to the extent the Buyers receive
the  foregoing as an Acquired Asset, as reflected on the Sellers\'
consolidated  balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the   5    
"Closing Balance Sheet"), which shall be prepared by the Sellers in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and consistent  with
past practice.   (b) The Actual Working Capital shall be determined by  the
Sellers and a copy of the calculation thereof (the "Working Capital 
Statement") shall be delivered by the Sellers to the Buyers as soon as 
practicable following the Closing Date, but not later than fifteen (15) 
calendar days thereafter. Representatives of the Buyers shall have the  right
to participate with the representatives of the Sellers in the  process of
preparing the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital  Statement and
shall have access to all data, schedules and work papers  used by the Sellers
in preparing the Working Capital Statement.   (c) The determination of
Actual Working Capital shall  become final and binding upon the parties on
the thirtieth (30th)  calendar day following receipt thereof by the Buyers
unless the Buyers  deliver written notice of their disagreement ("Notice of
Disagreement")  to the Sellers prior to such date in accordance with SECTION
13.3 hereof.  Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify the amounts set forth
on the  Working Capital Statement with which the Buyers disagree. If a Notice
of  Disagreement is sent by the Buyers, then the Actual Working Capital (as 
recalculated in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall become  final
and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x) the date the  parties
hereto resolve in writing any differences they have with respect  to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date any  disputed
amounts are finally determined in accordance with the balance of  this
paragraph. During the thirty (30) day period following the delivery  of a
Notice of Disagreement, the Sellers and the Buyers shall seek in  good faith
to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with  respect to
any amount specified in the Notice of Disagreement or  identified by either
parties during said thirty (30) day period. If, at  the end of such thirty
(30) day period, the Sellers and the Buyers have  not reached agreement on
such amounts, the amounts which remain in  dispute shall be recalculated by
an accounting firm mutually agreed upon  by the Sellers and the Buyers which
firm shall not have had a business  relationship with either party within the
prior twenty-four (24) months  (the "Independent Accountants"). The
Independent Accountants shall make a  ratable allocation of their charges for
such work as a part of their  determination, based on the proportion by which
the amount in dispute was  determined in favor of one party or the other. Any
amounts so  recalculated shall be final and binding on the parties.   (d)
If the Actual Working Capital is less than  $26,000,000, then the Buyers may
recover such shortfall with interest  thereon at a fluctuating rate that is
at all times equal to the prime  rate in effect from time to time at
Citibank, N.A. (or similar financial  institution) in New York on ninety (90)
day unsecured loans to  substantial and responsible customers, calculated on
the basis of the  actual number of days elapsed from the Closing Date to the
date of such  payment to the Buyers (interest calculated in the foregoing
manner is  referred to herein as "Interest") from the Escrow Account in
accordance  with the Escrow Agreement. In no event shall the Buyers attempt
to  recover such shortfall beyond the later of (i) six (6) months after the 
Closing Date or (ii) ten (10)   6     business days after the
Independent Accountants make a determination  under SECTION 1.4(C); PROVIDED
that such period shall be extended to the  extent that there have been delays
outside of the Buyers\' control.   (e) If the Actual Working Capital is
greater than  $26,000,000, then the Buyers shall promptly deliver to the
Sellers, as  Additional Purchase Price, the amount of such excess with
Interest within  five (5) business days after the final determination of the
Actual  Working Capital.   1.5. ASSUMPTION OF CERTAIN LEASES AND CONTRACTS.
The Sale Order shall provide for the assumption by the Sellers and assignment
to the Buyers or the Buyers\' designee of the Assumed Agreements effective as
of the Closing and shall be set forth on a pleading submitted to the
Bankruptcy Court on the following terms and conditions:   (a) Subject to
the provisions of SECTIONS 1.5(A)(I)-(V)  below, the Sellers shall (x) assume
and assign to the Buyers or to  Buyers\' designee, assuming Buyers\' designee
provides adequate assurance  of future performance, (A), as of the Closing,
the Assumed Agreements  listed on section 1 ("Section 1") of the Exhibit A to
the Sale Motion  ("Sale Motion Exhibit A") and (B) as of the effective date
of the  assumption and assignment which shall be no later than seventy-five
(75)  calendar days after the date on which the Sale Order is entered, the 
Assumed Agreements listed on section 2 ("Section 2") to the Sale Motion 
Exhibit A and (y) shall reject the Excluded Agreements listed on Exhibit  B
to the Sale Motion (the "Sale Motion Exhibit B"). Each of the Assumed 
Agreements on Sale Motion Exhibit A shall also be identified by the date  of
the Assumed Agreement (if available), the other non-debtor parties to  the
Assumed Agreement (the "Contract Counter-Party") and the address of  such
Contract Counter-Party. Sale Motion Exhibit A shall set forth any  monetary
amounts believed by the Sellers to be necessary to cure defaults  pursuant to
section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code as a condition to the  assumption and
assignment of each such Assumed Agreement, if any, as  determined by the
Sellers based on the Sellers\' books and records,  subject to the amendment
of such amounts by the Sellers from time to  time. Sale Motion Exhibit B
shall set forth the Excluded Agreements which  shall be identified by the
date of the Excluded Agreement (if available),  the Contract Counter-Party to
the Excluded Agreement and such party\'s  address. ANNEX A attached hereto,
Sale Motion Exhibit A and Sale Motion  Exhibit B shall be subject to
amendment as follows:   (i) At any time and from time to time prior to  and
including the commencement of the Sale Hearing, by delivery of  written
notice to the Sellers in accordance with SECTION 13.2  hereof, the Buyers, in
their discretion, may add Contracts to, or  remove Contracts from, ANNEX A
attached hereto, Section 1 of the  Sale Motion Exhibit A, Section 2 of the
Sale Motion Exhibit A and  the Sale Motion Exhibit B; PROVIDED that the
Buyers shall use  their commercially reasonable efforts to finalize any
additions  to, or deletions from, ANNEX A, Sale Motion Exhibit A and Sale 
Motion Exhibit B as soon as possible; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if  Contracts
are added to Section 1 of the Sale Motion   7     Exhibit A after the
commencement of the twenty-five (25) day  notice period, the assumption and
assignment of such Contracts  shall be effected pursuant to a separate motion
filed by the  Sellers.   (ii) Until seventy-five (75) days after the date 
on which the Sale Order is entered, the Buyers, in their  discretion, by
delivery of written notice to the Bankruptcy Court,  the Sellers in
accordance with SECTION 13.2 hereof and the  respective Contract Counter-
Parties, may designate (the  "Designation"), from time to time, any Contract
listed on ANNEX A  attached hereto and Section 2 of the Sale Motion Exhibit A
to be:   (x) assumed as an Assumed Agreement (the  "Post-Closing
Assumption") and assigned to the Buyers, as  of the date of such notice;  
(y) excluded from the Assumed Agreements and  thereby deemed an Excluded
Agreement (the "Post Closing  Exclusion") as of the date of such notice;
or   (z) excluded from the Assumed Agreements so  that it may be assigned
to a designee of the Buyers named  in such written notice (the "Post-Closing
Assignment", and  such Contracts designated pursuant to the Post Closing 
Assignment shall be the "Designated Assumed Agreements").  The assumption and
assignment of the Designated Assumed  Agreements is to be effected by
separate motions filed by  the Sellers. If such assignment is not so
authorized by the  Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the previous
sentence,  then such Contract shall be deemed an Excluded Agreement.  
(iii) Prior to the Designation of a Contract, the  Buyers shall have the
right to operate or use, as a subcontractor  or a sublessee, the real or
personal property or equipment subject  to such Contracts for their own
account subject to the receipt of  the Contract Counter-Party\'s consent if
such consent is required.  If the Contract Counter-Party\'s consent is
required to subcontract  or sublease such Contract to the Buyers, but the
Contract  Counter-Party does not consent to such subcontract or sublease 
then the Buyers shall designate such Contract pursuant to SECTION 
1.5(A)(II).   (iv) If the Contract Counter-Party consents to  sublease or
subcontract a Contract under SECTION 1.5(A)(III) or if  such consent is not
required, whether or not the Buyers operate or  use the real or personal
property or equipment subject to such  Contract, then the Buyers shall pay to
the Contract Counter-Party  the amounts that come due under such Contract
from the Closing  Date until the Designation.   8     (v) Upon the
Post-Closing Assumption or the  Post-Closing Assignment, the Buyers shall pay
the Cure Costs for  such Contract to the Contract Counter-Party. Upon the
Post-Closing  Exclusion, then Buyers shall pay Sellers the amount of the
Cure  Cost for such Contract that was retained by the Buyers pursuant to 
SECTION 1.3(A)(II) hereof.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained  in SECTION 1.5(A), (i) to the extent there exist any defaults
related to  an Assumed Agreement listed on Sale Motion Exhibit A that is not
a  Designated Assumed Agreement, the Buyers shall pay all monetary amounts 
necessary to cure defaults pursuant to section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy  Code
as a condition to the assumption and assignment of each such Assumed 
Agreement as determined by an order of the Bankruptcy Court (the "Cure 
Costs"); and (ii) to the extent there exist any defaults related to a 
Designated Assumed Agreement, the Buyers shall pay the Cure Costs upon  the
effectiveness of the assignment of the Designated Assumed Agreements  as a
condition to the assumption and assignment of each such Assumed  Agreement as
determined by an order of the Bankruptcy Court.   (c) The Buyers shall be
responsible for all costs and  expenses necessary in connection with
providing adequate assurance of  future performance and for the preparation
of declarations of an  authorized person of the Buyers on behalf of the
Buyers in connection  therewith pursuant to section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code with respect  to the Assumed Agreements listed on Sale Motion Exhibit A
other than the  Designated Assumed Agreements.   (d) Nothing herein shall
be construed as an admission by  any of the parties hereof that an Assumed
Agreement or a Designated  Assumed Agreement is an executory agreement or
unexpired lease as  interpreted under the Bankruptcy Code.   1.6. CLOSING
DATE. The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase and sale of the Acquired
Assets shall be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on the business day

Sellers, either  individually or collectively.   (g) Except as set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.6.1(G)  attached hereto, to the knowledge of any of the Sellers,

forth on  SCHEDULE 4.6.1(G) attached hereto, each Seller represents and
warrants  that it has not received any written or oral notice or
communication and,  to the knowledge of any of the Sellers, there has been no
public  disclosure nor any notice or disclosure in any official record
(including  any land records), with respect to any such special tax or
assessment,  planned public improvement, or special proceeding pending or
threatened.  The foregoing representations and warranties expressly supersede
and  survive the delivery of the special warranty deed to any Real
Property,  notwithstanding the terms of any such special warranty deed.  
(h) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.6.1(H),  there are no strips or gores

irrevocable private easements,  and all of such utilities are installed and
operating.   (j) SCHEDULE 4.6.1(J) is a true and correct list  of all water
rights which are used by any of the Sellers in connection  with the Acquired

the record or beneficial owners of the  Owned Water Rights. The Owned Water
Rights and the other water rights the  Sellers, either individually or
collectively, have pursuant to contract  rights (together, the "Water
Rights") have been of sufficient quantity  and quality to supply the business
needs of the Operations at each of the  locations of the Operations as
conducted prior to the Closing   18     Date. To the extent the Water
Rights include shares of stock or other  ownership interests in water or
irrigation companies, such Water Rights  are being and have been put to use
by the Sellers in accordance with all  bylaws or other water or irrigation
company requirements and all  assessments on such shares of stock or
ownership interests have been paid  in full and are presently paid current.
The Water Rights have received  all necessary governmental and regulatory
approvals for the uses to which  they are presently employed in the
Operations. None of the Sellers has  reason to believe that the Water Rights
will not be sufficient, in both  quantity and quality, for the future
business needs of the Operations if  conducted in accordance with the past
practices of the Sellers. The Water  Rights have been put to beneficial use
by the Sellers and have not been  forfeited or abandoned by the Sellers, in
whole or in part, under  applicable law.   (k) Except as listed on SCHEDULE

their terms. All rental and other payments due under each of the Property
Leases have been duly paid in accordance with the terms of such Property
Leases. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.6.1.5 hereto and except for the
Bankruptcy Court\'s approval of the Sale Order, the assignment of all of the
Sellers\' right, title and interest in and to the Property Leases pursuant to
this Agreement does not require the consent of any party to and will not
constitute an event of default under or permit any party to terminate or
change the existing terms of any Property Lease.   4.6.1.6. VIOLATION OF
LAW. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.6.1.6, none of the Real Property or
any condition or activity thereon, any plants, buildings, fixtures, or

of the Sellers. No affiliate of the Sellers, who is not itself a Seller, owns
or has rights to any assets, properties, or rights of the Acquired
Assets.   4.20. PRESERVATION OF DOCUMENTS. Consummation of the

date by which competing bidders (the "Auction") must  submit in writing
Competing Proposals to purchase either (a)  substantially all the assets of
the Sellers, (b) the Western  Assets, or (c) the Southeastern Assets, but in
no event shall the  Auction be after May 15, 2002.   (iii) An initial
qualified bid must contain the  following to be considered a "Qualified
Bid":   (1) with respect to any Competing Proposal  for substantially all
the Assets of the Sellers, such  Competing Proposal (a) must provide for
consideration for  value that is greater than the sum of (i) the Purchase 
Price, (ii) the amount of the Break-Up Fee and the maximum  Additional
Expense Reimbursement and (iii) the Initial  Minimum Incremental Bid Amount
(as defined below), (b) have  substantially the same terms and conditions as
the  agreement between the Buyers and the Sellers, and (c) be  accompanied
by satisfactory evidence of committed financing  or other ability to perform.
For avoidance of doubt, this  Agreement shall be deemed to be a Qualified Bid
for  substantially all of Sellers\' assets;   (2) with respect to any
Competing Proposal  for only the Western Assets, such Competing Proposal
(a)  must provide for consideration for value that is greater  than the sum
of (i) the Purchase Price MINUS the value of  the highest initial Qualified
Bid for the Southeastern  Assets without regard to the Break-Up Fee or the
maximum  Additional Expense Reimbursement, (ii) the amount of the  Break-Up
Fee   39     and the maximum Additional Expense Reimbursement and
(iii)  the Initial Minimum Incremental Bid Amount (as defined  below), (b)
has substantially the same terms and conditions  as the agreement between the
Buyers and the Sellers, and  (c) be accompanied by satisfactory evidence of
committed  financing or other ability to perform. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, in order for any Competing Proposal for the  Western Assets to be
considered a Qualified Bid, at least  one Qualified Bid for the Southeastern
Assets must have  been submitted which together with such Competing
Proposal  for the Western Assets meets the Qualified Bid requirements 
required in (1) above; or   (3) with respect to any Competing Proposal  for
only the Southeastern Assets, such Competing Proposal  (a) must provide for
consideration for value that is  greater than the sum of (i) the Purchase
Price MINUS the  value of the highest initial Qualified Bid for the Western 
Assets without regard to the Break-Up Fee or the maximum  Additional Expense
Reimbursement, (ii) the amount of the  Break-Up Fee and the maximum
Additional Expense  Reimbursement and (iii) the Initial Minimum Incremental
Bid  Amount (as defined below), (b) have substantially the same  terms and
conditions as the agreement between the Buyers  and the Sellers, and (c) be
accompanied by satisfactory  evidence of committed financing or other ability
to  perform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for any  Competing
Proposal for the Southeastern Assets to be  considered a Qualified Bid, at
least one Qualified Bid for  the Western Assets must have been submitted
which together  with such Competing Proposal for the Southeastern Assets 
meets the Qualified Bid requirements required in (1) above.   (iv) Any
entity intending to submit a competing  bid may qualify as a Qualified Bidder
only if (a) the competing  bidder delivers to the Sellers an executed
confidentiality  agreement in form and substance substantially the same as
any  confidentiality agreement by and between the Buyers and the  Sellers
(except that, prior to submission of a Qualified Bid,  disclosure of the
Qualified Bidder\'s interest and proposal but not  identity shall be
permitted), (b) the competing bidder delivers to  the Sellers a bid that in
good faith and upon the advice of their  independent financial advisors, the
Sellers, in consultation with  the creditors\' committee (if any is
functioning, willing and  available to consult on a timely basis), believe is
reasonably  likely to lead to a higher and better offer for the subject 
assets, (c) the competing bidder is one whom the Sellers, in  consultation
with the creditors\' committee (if any is functioning,  willing and available
to consult on a timely basis), in good faith  determine is reasonably likely
(based on the availability of  financing and proof of financial wherewithal,
experience and other  relevant considerations) to be able to consummate a
transaction  based on the competing bid, if selected as the successful
bidder  for the subject assets and (d) the competing bidder may not seek  to
use a credit bid under   40     section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code (a
"Qualified Bidder"). For  avoidance of doubt, the Buyers shall be deemed to
be a Qualified  Bidder.   (v) The Sellers shall establish procedures for
an  auction at which only Qualified Bidders who have previously  submitted a
Qualified Bid may bid, that, among other things, set  the minimum incremental
bid amount at $100,000 for the initial  incremental bid for all or any
portion of the Assets (the "Initial  Minimum Incremental Bid Amount").

consideration for the Buyers\' entry in this Agreement, the Sellers shall pay

of written notice  thereof, or waived by the Buyers;   (g) by the Sellers,
if there has been a material  violation or breach by the Buyers of any

respect to any thereof and (z) enforce, at  the request of the Buyers and at
the sole expense and for the account of  the Buyers, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, any and all rights  of the Sellers arising from such
Contract or Permit against the other  party or parties thereto or the issuer
or grantor thereof (including the  right to elect to terminate such Contract
or Permit in accordance with  the terms thereof). In addition, each party
will take such other actions  (at its expense) as may reasonably be requested
by the other party in  order to place each party, insofar as reasonably
possible, in the same  position as if such Contract or Permit had been
transferred as  contemplated hereby and so that all the benefits relating
thereto,  including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain and
dominion,  control and command, shall inure to the Buyers.   11.3. NON-
COMPETE AND NON-SOLICITATION. (a) In consideration of, among other things,
the Purchase Price set forth in this Agreement, during the period from the
date hereof through the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, except for
operations performed pursuant to SECTIONS 1.5(A)(II) and (III), the Sellers
will not:   (i) directly or indirectly, engage or invest in,  own, manage,
operate, finance, control or participate in the  ownership, management,
operation, financing, or control of, be  associated with, or in any manner
connected with, lend the credit  to, or render services or advice to, any
business, firm,  corporation, partnership, association, joint venture or
other  entity that engages or conducts any business engaged in or  conducted
by the Operations as of the Closing Date anywhere within  100 miles of the
business operations of either of the Buyers  anywhere in the United States;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Sellers  may own less than 1% of the outstanding
shares of any class of  securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise
participating  in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are 
listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have  been
registered under section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934, as
amended;   (ii) directly or indirectly, either for itself or  any other
person or entity, hire any of the officers or directors  or other persons
employed by the Buyers, their Affiliates or their  respective successors or
assigns, or solicit or induce such  persons to leave the employ of the Buyers
or their Affiliates;   49     (iii) directly or indirectly, approach or
seek  business from any Customer (as defined below), refer business from 
any Customer to any enterprise or business or be paid commissions  based on
sales received from any Customer by any enterprise or  business. For purposes
of this SECTION 11.3(A)(III), the term  "Customer" means any person, firm,
corporation, partnership,  association or other entity located within 100
miles of the  Operations to which the Operations provided goods or services 
during the 36-month period prior to the time at which any  determination
shall be made that any such person, firm,  corporation, partnership,
association or other entity is a  Customer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the term
Customer shall not  include any referral of business by the Sellers to the
Buyers or  their Affiliates. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term 
"Affiliate" shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or  under common
control with the named party.   11.4. USE OF NAMES. From and after the
Closing, the Sellers shall not use any of their names or any variation
thereof in the conduct of any of their businesses (except the winding up of
their business) and the Sellers, other than the Stockholder, shall change
their names.   12. INDEMNIFICATION.   12.1.1. INDEMNIFICATION OF THE
BUYERS. Each of the Sellers jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyers and their Affiliates in respect of any and all claims, losses,
diminutions in value, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including, without
limitation, settlement costs and any legal or other expenses for
investigating or defending any actions or threatened actions) incurred by the
Buyers or their Affiliates in connection with each and all of the following
together with Interest thereon:   (a) any misrepresentation made by any of
the Sellers in  this Agreement (including any Schedules or Exhibits hereto)
or any  condition or document described in ARTICLE 9 or any breach by any of
the  Sellers of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement 
(including any Schedules or Exhibits hereto) or any condition or document 
described in ARTICLE 9;   (b) the breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation  of any of the Sellers contained in this Agreement or any
condition or  document described in ARTICLE 9; PROVIDED that, with respect to
claims  arising out of SECTION 6.1, the Sellers agree to indemnify the
Buyers  against all liabilities arising under the WARN Act except to the
extent  such liabilities arise out of the Buyers\' subsequent termination
or  reduction of hours of former employees of the Sellers whom the Buyers 
initially hired after the Closing;   (c) any liabilities or obligations
(continuing or  otherwise) arising from the failure of the Buyers to obtain
the  protections afforded by compliance with the notification and other 
requirements of the bulk sales laws in force in the jurisdictions in  
50     which such laws may be applicable to the Sellers, the Operations,
the  Acquired Assets or the Transactions;   (d) any claims against or
debts, liabilities or  obligations of any of the Sellers or relating to the
Acquired Assets or  the Operations not specifically assumed by the Buyers
pursuant to SECTION  2.1, whether known or unknown, including, without
limitation, the  Excluded Liabilities;   (e) any and all Environmental
Damages, whether or not  disclosed on Schedules hereto or otherwise known by
the Buyers or the  Sellers;   (f) any and all taxes and assessments by any
taxing  authority relating to periods prior to the Closing Date whether on
not  such taxes or assessments are imposed or assessed prior to or after
the  Closing Date; and   (g) any and all costs arising from Sellers\'
failure to  notify a party pursuant to SECTION 7.9 hereof.  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this SECTION 12.1.1, the Buyers agrees
that any claims, losses, diminutions in value, damages, liabilities and
expenses for which the Buyers or their Affiliates seek indemnification
pursuant to this SECTION 12.1.1 shall be calculated after subtracting any
insurance proceeds net of premiums paid with respect to such insurance
proceeds and any tax benefits received by the Buyers or their Affiliates on
account of or relating to such claim, losses, diminution in value, damages,
liabilities and expenses. In connection with any claim for indemnification
made by the Buyers or their Affiliates, for which the Sellers are obligated
to indemnify the Buyers or their Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Sellers shall be liable for all punitive damages
assessed against the Buyers or their Affiliates in connection with any such
claim; PROVIDED that the Sellers shall not be liable for any claims for
punitive damages originated by the Buyers or their Affiliates.  
Notwithstanding the above, the Buyers may only seek recovery for any
indemnification that arises under this SECTION 12.1.1 from the Escrow Account
or the Idaho Holdback; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any claims are first satisfied
from the Idaho Holdback.   12.1.2. INDEMNIFICATION OF THE SELLERS. The
Buyers will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers in respect of any and all
claims, losses, diminution in value, damages, liabilities, and expenses
(including without limitation settlement costs, any legal or other expenses
for investigating or defending any actions or threatened actions) incurred by
the Sellers in connection with each and all of the following together with
Interest thereon:   (a) any misrepresentation made by Buyers in this 
Agreement (including any Schedules or Exhibits hereto) or any condition  or
document described in ARTICLE 10 or any breach by the Buyers or any 
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (including any 
Schedules or Exhibits hereto) or any condition or document described in 
ARTICLE 10;   51     (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation  of the Buyers contained in this Agreement or any condition or
document  described in ARTICLE 10; and   (c) any claims against or debts,
liabilities or  obligations arising in and relating to the operations by
Buyers of the  Acquired Assets or the Operations following the Closing.  
Notwithstanding any other provision if this SECTION 12.1.2, the Sellers agree
that any claims, losses, diminutions of value, damages, liabilities
and expenses incurred by the Sellers for which they seek indemnification
pursuant to this SECTION 12.1.2 shall be calculated after subtracting any
insurance proceeds net of premiums paid in respect of such insurance proceeds
and any tax benefits received by the Sellers on account of or relating to
such claim, loss, diminution in value, damages, liabilities and expenses. In
connection with any claim for indemnification made by the Sellers pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the Buyers shall be liable for all punitive
damages assessed against the Sellers in connection with any such claim;
PROVIDED, that, the Buyers shall not be liable for any claims for punitive
damages originated by the Sellers. Indemnities provided in this SECTION
12.1.2 shall not exceed $4,500,000 in the aggregate.   12.2. SURVIVAL. Any
claim for indemnification shall survive the Closing, but only for the periods
of time set forth in this SECTION 12.2. Any claim for indemnification shall
survive the termination date if a party, prior to such termination date,
shall have notified the other party in writing, specifying in reasonable
detail, the facts that constitute or may give rise to such claim, the basis
under this Agreement for such claim and an estimate of the amount of such
claim (which estimate shall not be binding). No party will have liability
(for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to any claim
for indemnification unless the notice specified in the immediately prior
sentence is delivered to such party on or prior to the termination date
specified in this SECTION 12.2.   12.2.1. GENERAL CLAIMS. Any claim for
indemnification hereunder must be made on or prior to the one (1) year
anniversary of the Closing Date.   12.3. DEFENSE BY THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY.
In connection with any claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder resulting
from or arising out of any claim or legal proceeding by a person other than
the indemnified party, the indemnifying party at its sole cost and expense
may, upon written notice to the indemnified party received by the indemnified
party within ten (10) calendar days after the indemnifying party\'s receipt
of notice of such claim, assume the defense of any such claim or legal
proceeding provided that the indemnifying party acknowledges its obligation
to indemnify the indemnified party in respect of the entire amount of the
claims asserted therein. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of any
such claim or legal proceeding, the indemnifying party shall select counsel
reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party to conduct the defense of such
claims or legal proceedings and at its sole cost and expense shall take all
steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof. The indemnifying party
shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such claim or legal proceeding, without the prior written consent
of the indemnified party (which   52    consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) unless the indemnifying party admits in writing its
liability and agrees to hold the indemnified party harmless from and against
any losses, damages, expenses and liabilities arising out of such settlement
and concurrently with such settlement the indemnifying party pays into court
the full amount of all losses, damages, expenses and liabilities to be paid
by the indemnifying party in connection with such settlement. The indemnified
party shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of
any such action, with its own counsel and at its own expense and shall be
entitled to any and all information and documentation relating thereto. If
the indemnifying party does not assume (or continue to diligently
and competently prosecute) the defense of any such claim or litigation
resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms hereof, the indemnified
party may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may
deem appropriate (and the indemnifying party may participate at its own
expense), including, but not limited to, settling such claim or litigation,
after giving notice of the same to the indemnifying party but such settlement
shall not be made without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) unless the indemnified
party agrees that the indemnifying party is not liable for such claim under
this Agreement.   12.4. NOTICE. The parties hereto agree that in the event
of any occurrence which may give rise to a claim by an indemnified party
hereunder the indemnified party will give prompt notice thereof to the
indemnifying party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to timely give the notice
provided in this Section shall not be a defense to the liability of the
indemnifying party for such claim, but the indemnifying party may recover any
actual damages arising from the indemnified party\'s failure to give such
timely notice.   12.5. WAIVER. The indemnified party agrees that it will not
waive any statute of limitations or defense that would increase the liability
of the indemnifying party hereunder without (except in connection with
pending litigation in which the indemnifying party has not assumed the
defense) the consent of the indemnifying party.   12.6. ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE. The Buyers shall receive from the Idaho Holdback, and upon its
depletion, from the Escrow Account the amount by which Actual Accounts
Receivable exceeds the sum of the amounts collected by the Buyers in
satisfaction of the Actual Accounts Receivable by the later of the due date
of such receivables or one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after
the Closing Date. The Buyers will make commercially reasonable efforts to
collect the Actual Accounts Receivable during such 120 days. If the Escrow
Account is depleted pursuant to SECTIONS 1.4 or 1.5 or ARTICLE 12, the
Sellers shall promptly pay such amount to the Buyers. The Buyers shall only
seek such payment from the Escrow Account or the Sellers within the six (6)
months following the Closing. In exchange for such reduction of the Escrow
Account or payment, the Buyers shall assign to the Sellers any such
uncollected Actual Accounts Receivable and all related documents. Amounts
paid "on account" and not designated by the payor to be paid in satisfaction
of specific invoices or clearly identifiable to specific invoices shall be
presumed to have been paid in satisfaction of the payor\'s oldest obligation
to the Sellers and shall be so applied on the books of the Buyers. "Actual
Accounts Receivable" shall mean the accounts and notes receivable minus
allowance for doubtful accounts, as reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet.   53    12.7. PAYMENT. Until the Idaho Holdback is depleted and
the Escrow Account is released to the Sellers, indemnification claims by the
Buyers or their Affiliates shall be satisfied by the (i) a reduction of the
Idaho Holdback, and once depleted, then (ii) a reduction of the Escrow
Agreement by the amount of such claim, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Buyers shall
comply with the procedures set forth in this ARTICLE 12.   12.8. THRESHOLD.
Neither the Sellers nor the Buyers shall be permitted to enforce any claims
for indemnification pursuant to SECTIONS 12.1.1(A), 12.1.1(E), or 12.1.2(A)
(but not to include claims based upon (a) any misrepresentation with respect
to SECTIONS 4.1, 4.2, 4.6.1(A), 4.6.1(B), 4.6.2, 5.1, 5.2; (b) any fraudulent
or intentional misrepresentation of any of the Sellers or the Buyers
contained in this Agreement or any other document executed by the Buyers or
the Sellers in connection herewith, including any assessment by a taxing
authority alleged to arise from a willful, false or fraudulent intent on the
part of the Sellers to evade taxes, or from the failure by any of the Sellers
to file a return, none of which shall be subject to this limitation) (each a
"Limited Indemnity Claim"), until the aggregate of all Limited
Indemnity Claims due to the Sellers collectively or the Buyers collectively,
as the case may be, exceeds $200,000 (the "Threshold Amount"). Once the
aggregate of Limited Indemnity Claims in excess of the Threshold Amount have
been asserted by the Buyers collectively or by the Sellers collectively, all
Limited Indemnity Claims, including those below the Threshold Amount, may be
pursued unless otherwise limited by this Agreement.   13. MISCELLANEOUS
PROVISIONS.   13.1. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. The parties hereto
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court (or
any court exercising appellate jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Court) over
any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or entered into in connection
herewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each
party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or
proceedings may be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in
connection therewith.   13.2. NOTICES. All notices, requests, demands and
other communications called for or contemplated hereunder shall be in writing

executed in connection herewith may be assigned by any party without the
consent of the other parties hereto except that the Buyers shall have
the right to assign all or any portion of their rights and obligations under

successors in interest and permitted assignees any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement unless so stated herein to the contrary.  
56     13.5. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVER. This Agreement and all
Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules hereto set forth the entire understanding of
the parties and may be modified only by a written instrument duly executed by
each party. Except as herein expressly provided to the contrary, no breach of
any covenant, agreement, warranty or representation shall be deemed waived
unless expressly waived in writing by the party who might assert such
breach.   13.6. SURVIVAL. Subject to the succeeding sentence, each
and every representation, warranty and covenant contained in this Agreement
shall expire with, and be terminated and extinguished by the consummation of
the sale of the Acquired Assets and the transfer of the Assumed Liabilities
pursuant to this Agreement, and such representations, warranties and
covenants shall not survive the Closing Date, and neither the Sellers, the
Buyers nor any officer, director, trustee or affiliate of any of them shall
be under any liability whatsoever with respect to any such representation,
warranty or covenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the obligations of
the Buyers with respect to the Assumed Liabilities and of the Sellers with
respect to the Excluded Liabilities, the covenants contained in SECTIONS 1.4,
