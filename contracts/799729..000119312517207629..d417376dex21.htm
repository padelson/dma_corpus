(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and from and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
of Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger

has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration
in accordance with this _Section 2.04_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.05 _Dissenting Shares._

 

(a) Shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by holders who have not voted
such shares in favor of this Agreement and who are entitled to appraisal
rights and have properly exercised such rights in accordance with Part 13 of
the MBCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03_, and the holders
thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by, and shall be
entitled only to receive such payments for such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with, Part 13 of the MBCA; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such shareholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively
waive, withdraw or lose such shareholders rights under Part 13 of the MBCA or
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall otherwise determine that such
shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Part 13 of the MBCA,
such shareholders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to be
Dissenting Shares (including for purposes of _Section 2.03(a)_), and shall
be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (payable without any interest thereon) upon
surrender of the certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing such
shares of Company Common Stock and related documents, as compensation for such
cancellation. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
provided in Part 13 of the MBCA and as provided in the previous sentence.

received by the Company of intent to demand appraisal of the fair value of
any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices or demands and
any other instruments or notices served pursuant to the MBCA and (B) if taking
place prior to the Effective Time, the opportunity and right to participate
in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such instruments, notices
and demands and the exercise of appraisal rights under the MBCA. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any
payment or other commitment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal
rights, including any agreement or acknowledgement that any shareholder is
entitled to appraisal rights under Part 13 of the MBCA, (y) offer to settle
or settle any such rights or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal
rights in accordance with the MBCA.

 

Section 2.06 _Company Equity Awards; ESPP._

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed upon with Parent, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each Company Stock Option, whether or not vested and
exercisable, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option,
by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise or settlement of such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (such product, the "Option Cash Amount"). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Option Cash Amount to an account
identified by the Company prior to the Effective Time. Payments of the Option
Cash Amount shall be made by the Surviving Corporation at, or within five

will be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time without payment of
any consideration.

 

(b) Except as otherwise agreed upon with Parent, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award shall

Company Restricted Stock Awards, including shares that become fully vested and
with respect to which the restrictions shall lapse immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right
to receive the per share Merger Consideration and shall be treated in the
Merger in the same manner as the other shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.03(a)_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, funds sufficient to pay the
aggregate Company Restricted Stock Award consideration to an account
identified by the

Corporation at, or within five Business Days of, the Effective Time, without
interest. All payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.06(b)_ shall be

duplication of benefits with respect to any Company Restricted Stock Awards.

 

(c) Except as otherwise agreed upon with Parent, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each outstanding Company RSU Award, whether or not
vested, shall not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and shall
be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Time and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such Company RSU Award shall have the
right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award by (ii) the
Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the "RSU Award
Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, the holder of any canceled
Company RSU Award shall only be entitled to receive the RSU Award Payment in
respect of such canceled Company RSU Award. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, funds sufficient to pay
the aggregate RSU Award Payments to an account identified by the Company
prior to the Effective Time. The RSU Award Payments described in this _Section
2.06(c)_ shall be made by the Surviving Corporation at, or within five
Business Days of, the Effective Time, without interest; _provided_  that such
payment shall be made at such other time or times following the Effective Time
consistent with the terms of the Company RSU Award to the extent necessary to
avoid the imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A of the
Code. All payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.06(c)_ shall be made
through the Surviving Corporations payroll and/or equity award maintenance
systems, subject to withholding in accordance with applicable Tax law.

 

(d) Except as otherwise agreed upon with Parent, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holders thereof, each outstanding Company PRSU Award shall be deemed fully
earned but not yet settled at the target performance level regardless of the
actual achievement of the applicable performance metric as of the Effective
Time, any time-based restrictions thereon shall lapse, and such Company PRSU
Awards shall not be assumed by Parent or Merger Sub in the Merger and shall be
canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Time and, in exchange therefor,
each former holder of any such Company PRSU Award shall have the right to
receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company PRSU Award (taking into account
the achievement and acceleration contemplated by this _Section 2.06(d)_) by
(ii) the Merger Consideration (such amounts payable hereunder, the "PRSU Award
Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, the holder of any canceled
Company PRSU Award shall only be entitled to receive the PRSU Award Payment in
respect of such canceled Company PRSU Award. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, funds sufficient
to pay the aggregate PRSU Award Payments to an account identified by the
Company prior to the Effective Time. The PRSU Award Payments described in this
_Section 2.06(d)_ shall be made by the Surviving Corporation at, or within
five Business Days of, the

 



19  Effective Time, without interest; _provided_ that such payment shall be made
at such other time or times following the Effective Time consistent with the
terms of the Company PRSU Award to the extent necessary to avoid the
imposition of additional income tax under Section 409A of the Code. All
payments provided pursuant to this _Section 2.06(d)_ shall be made through

will be permitted to enroll in the ESPP following the date hereof, (iii)
no existing participants will be permitted to increase their respective rates
of deductions and purchases following the date hereof, (iv) the final exercise
date for all offering periods shall be such date as the Company determines in
its sole discretion ( _provided_ that such date shall be no later than the
date that is five days prior to the Effective Time (the " _Final Exercise
Date_ ")), (v) each ESPP participants accumulated contributions under
the ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, and (vi)
the ESPP shall terminate on the date immediately prior to the date on which
the Effective Time occurs and no further rights shall be granted or exercised
under the ESPP thereafter. All shares of Company Common Stock purchased on or
prior to the Final Exercise Date shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and

committee(s) administering the Company Stock Plans or the ESPP) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary for
the treatment of the Company Equity Awards and the ESPP pursuant to this
_Section 2.06_, which resolutions will also provide that such Company Equity
Awards and the Company Stock Plans shall terminate conditioned upon, and

Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 2.07_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such customary amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated under this _Article 2_.

 



20 Section 2.09 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Exchange Agent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Tax law and such

similar Applicable Law affecting creditors rights generally and by general
principles of equity.

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board duly adopted resolutions (i) declaring that this

and delivery of this Agreement.

Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization._ The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the

assets are bound; or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with such exceptions, in

individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) all such information is

Letter from the Sponsor to invest, on the terms and subject only to the

exhibits, schedules, and annexes thereto) from the financial institutions
identified therein (the "Debt Commitment Letter" and, together with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitment Letters") to provide, on the
terms and subject only to the conditions expressly stated therein, debt
financing in the amounts set forth therein (being collectively referred to as
the "Debt Financing" and, together with the Equity Financing, the
"Financing") and (iii) all fee letters (subject to redactions of fee amounts
and pricing terms, including in any "market flex"

 



42  and/or "securities demand" provisions, so long as such redaction does not

Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt
Commitment Letter, and payment of any other fees and expenses and obligations
required to be paid or satisfied by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing
(collectively, the "Required Amounts")). The Financing Commitment Letters
are, as to Parent, Merger Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub,
the other parties thereto, enforceable against such Persons in accordance with
their terms, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and by general principles of equity. As of the date hereof,
the Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub (as
applicable), and to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, the other parties
thereto; and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default
or breach under any of the Financing Commitment Letters or the Fee Letter.
Parent does not have any reason to believe (both before and after giving
effect to any "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) that any of the
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing will not be
satisfied on a timely basis or that the amount of the Financing necessary to
fund the Required Amounts will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on
the date of the Closing, assuming the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.01_
and _7.02_ are satisfied at Closing. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is aware of
any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the representations or
warranties of Parent or Merger Sub in any Financing Commitment Letters

Letters contain all of the conditions precedent and other conditions
and contingencies to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the
full amount of the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. Other

and related engagement letter, there are no side letters or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings (written or oral) to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is a party related (directly or indirectly) to the Financing other
than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. The
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not subject to

or pursuant to which any shareholder of the Company has agreed to vote to

understandings (in each case, whether oral or written) between Parent, Merger
Sub, the Sponsor or any of their

 



44  respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys
management or directors, on the other hand, that relate in any way to, or are
in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Sponsor (or any of their respective
Affiliates) has entered into any Contract with any Person prohibiting or
seeking to prohibit such Person from providing or seeking to provide debt
financing to any Person in connection with a transaction involving the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.

cause the return or destruction thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section
6.02(a)_, if, at any time on or after the date hereof, but prior to obtaining
the Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did
not, directly or indirectly, result from or principally arise out of a
material breach of this _Section 6.02_, (iii) the Company Board determines in

legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,

Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal and afford such Third Party access to the businesses, properties,
assets and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (B) enter into,

event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any material non-public information
or other data or information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries or
access provided to such Third Party, in each case which was not
previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in _Section 6.02(a)_, the Company and its Representatives may (x)
following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, and
provided that such Acquisition Proposal did not, directly or indirectly,
result from or principally arise out of a material breach of this _Section
6.02_, contact such Third Party solely in order to clarify and understand the
terms and conditions of an Acquisition Proposal made by such Third Party in
order to permit the Company Board to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal and (y) direct any Persons to this Agreement, including the specific
provisions of this _Section 6.02_.

 



49 (c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24

any inquires, proposals or offers that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, or of any requests for information or access to the
businesses, properties, assets or personnel of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include (i) a copy of the
applicable written Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, proposal or offer
(or, if oral, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
or other inquiry, proposal or offer) and (ii) the identity of the Third Party
making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or information or
access request. The Company shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed
on a reasonably current basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of the status
of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such
Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, proposal or offer, and the material
terms and conditions thereof (including any change in price or form of
consideration or other material amendment thereto), including by providing a
copy of material documentation setting forth or related to the material terms

exchanged between the Third Party (or its Representatives) making such
Acquisition Proposal and the Company or its Subsidiaries (or its or their
respective Representatives) within 24 hours after exchange thereof.

 

(d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver or termination of any provision of,
any standstill or similar agreement to which any of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party, other than to the extent the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that failure to provide such waiver, release or termination would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.02_, the
Company agrees that in the event any Subsidiary or Representative takes any
action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach by the
Company of this _Section 6.02_, then the Company shall be deemed to have so
breached this _Section 6.02_.

 

 __Section 6.03 _Company Recommendation._

 

(a) Subject to _Section 6.03(b)_ and _Section 6.03(c)_, the Company Board

entered into in accordance with _Section 6.02(b)_) or other arrangement
constituting or that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any agreement, Contract or commitment or other
arrangement requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, breach or fail to

 



50  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (vi) resolve or
publicly propose to take any action described in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (v) (each of the foregoing actions described in clauses (i) through
(vi) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

 

(b) (i) Subject to the Companys compliance with _Sections 6.02_ and _6.03_ ,
at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Company Board
may, if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law, (A) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (1) a
Superior Proposal received after the date hereof or (2) any material fact,
event, change, development or circumstance not known or
reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date hereof (or, if
known, the consequences of which were not known nor reasonably foreseeable)
and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal (such fact, event, change,
development, circumstance or consequences thereof, an "Intervening Event") or
(B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(h)_ and authorize the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal (which
agreement shall be entered into substantially concurrently with such
termination), subject in each case to compliance with the terms of paragraph
(ii) or (iii) below, as applicable. 

(ii) In the case of a Superior Proposal, (x) no Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made and (y) no termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ may be made, in either case:

 

(A) until after the third Business Day following written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(h)_ (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") and specifying the reasons
therefor, including, if applicable, the material terms and conditions of, and
the identity of the Third Party making, such Superior Proposal, and a copy of
any other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal, which
shall require a new notice period of two Business Days, and compliance with
this _Section 6.03(b)_ with respect to such new notice);

 

(B) unless during such three Business Day period (or two Business Day period
following an amended proposal), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and
shall cause their respective Representatives to, to the extent requested by
Parent, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in good faith to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Guarantee
and the Financing Commitment Letters as would enable the Company Board to
maintain the Company Recommendation and not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement; and

 



51 (C) unless, following the expiration of such three Business Day period (or
two Business Day period following an amended proposal), the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into consideration any amendments
to this Agreement, the Guarantee and the Financing Commitment Letters
proposed by Parent, (x) that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law and (y) that such Acquisition Proposal continues
to be a Superior Proposal.

(iii) In the case of an Intervening Event, no Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 6.03(b)_ may be made:

(A) until after the third Business Day following written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action and
specifying the facts underlying the determination by the Company Board that an
Intervening Event has occurred, and the facts underlying and the reason for
the Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case in reasonable detail (a
"Notice of Intervening Event");

(B) unless during such three Business Day period, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, to
the extent requested by Parent, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives
in good faith to enable Parent to amend this Agreement, the Guarantee and the
Financing Commitment Letters in such a manner that obviates the need for an
Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 

(C) unless, following the expiration of such three Business Day period, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into consideration any amendments
to this Agreement, the Guarantee and the Financing Commitment Letters proposed
by Parent, that the failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law.

The provisions of this _Section 6.03(b)(iii)_ shall also apply to any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to an Intervening
Event, in which case such change shall require a new Notice of Intervening
Event and the Company shall be required to comply again with the provisions
of this _Section 6.03(b)(iii)_, except that any reference to three Business
Days shall instead be to two Business Days.

 

(c) Nothing contained in _Section 6.02_ or this _Section 6.03_ or elsewhere
in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure
to the Companys shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board or any committee thereof, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or any disclosure requirements under
Applicable Law; _provided_ that (x) the Company and the Company Board may not
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except

 



52  as permitted by _Section 6.03(b)(ii);_ and (iii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a stop, look and listen communication or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act,
which actions shall not, in and of themselves, constitute or be deemed to
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 6.04 _Approval of Merger Agreement._

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement in preliminary form
for the Shareholder Meeting (together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, including the form
of proxy, the "Proxy Statement"). Subject to the receipt from Parent and
Merger Sub of the information regarding Parent, Merger Sub and their
Affiliates, as applicable, described below in this _Section 6.04(a)_, the
Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and no later than 20 Business Days) after the date hereof. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to and resolve as
promptly as reasonably practicable any comments received from the SEC or its
staff concerning the Proxy Statement, and shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
resolution of any such comments. The Company shall notify Parent and Merger
Sub promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials and of any request by the SEC or its staff or
any other government officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement and shall supply the others with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or
its staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect
to the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate, and shall cause their Affiliates to
cooperate, with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Proxy Statement, including using reasonable best efforts to promptly
furnish to the Company in writing upon request any and all information
relating to Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates as may be
required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under Applicable Law. Parent
shall ensure that such information supplied by it and its Affiliates
in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date it is
first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholder
Meeting or filed with the SEC (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and shall consider Parents comments in good faith. The
Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement (i) will not on the date it is
first mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the
Shareholder Meeting contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading and (ii) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company assumes no responsibility with respect to
information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or
their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall pay all filing fees required to be paid to the
SEC in connection with the Proxy Statement.

 



53 (b) Subject to _Section 6.04(a)_, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the clearance of the Proxy Statement by the SEC (including by
running broker searches sufficiently in advance of the earliest possible
record date on which the Proxy Statement can be mailed to avoid any delays in
mailing the Proxy Statement), the Company shall, in accordance with
Applicable Law and the Companys governing documents, duly set a record date
for, call, give notice of, convene and, no more than 45 calendar days
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement by the SEC, hold a special
meeting of the Companys shareholders (including any adjournments and
postponements thereof, the "Shareholder Meeting") for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon the matters requiring Shareholder
Approval;  _provided_ that notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Shareholder Meeting (A) with
the consent of Parent, (B) if, on a date on which the Shareholder Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Shareholder Approval or
to represent a quorum therefor or (C) after consultation with Parent and
outside legal counsel, to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Shareholder
Meeting. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
shareholders and to solicit from shareholders of the Company proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the vote of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
required by Applicable Law to effect the Merger.

 

Section 6.05 _Access to Information_. Subject to Applicable Law, _Section
6.12_, _Section 6.18_ and applicable contractual restrictions, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parents officers and Parents other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to its properties, books, Contracts, personnel, Tax
Returns and records. The foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to
provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any books,
Contracts or records governed by a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other
similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof, (b) to provide access to or
otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent that
the provision of such information would in the good faith judgment of the
Company based on advice of counsel jeopardize any attorney-client, work
product or other legal privilege or protection (it being agreed that, (1) in
the case of clauses (a), (b) and (d), the Company shall give notice to Parent
of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to violate such restriction or waive the applicable
privilege or protection and (2) in the case of clause (a), the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents of Third
Parties that are necessary to permit such access), (c) to provide access to
or otherwise make available any information relating to the process conducted
by the Company that led to the execution of this Agreement, or (d) to provide
access to or otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to
the extent that the provision of such information could reasonably be expected
to in the judgment of the Company based on

 



54  advice of counsel violate any Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall cause their
respective Representatives not to, contact any customer, partner, vendor or
supplier of the Company in connection with the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the Companys prior
written consent (such consent to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that any such
contact shall be arranged and supervised by Representatives of the Company.
All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall be
directed to the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary or other
Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be deemed
"Evaluation Material" (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) under and
be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.06 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent will
give prompt notice to the other (and will subsequently keep the other informed
on a reasonably current basis of any material developments related to such
notice) upon (a) its becoming aware of the occurrence or existence of any
fact, event or circumstance that (i) has, (x) with respect to the Company, had
or would reasonably be expected have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (y)
with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) is reasonably likely to result in
any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ not being able to be satisfied
prior to the End Date and (b) receipt of any written notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No notification given by any party pursuant to
this  _Section 6.06_ shall limit or otherwise affect any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in
this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice.

Section 6.07 _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who continue
employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date ("Continuing
Employees"), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the service of each such Continuing Employee to be recognized for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and, with respect to any vacation or
severance plan only, benefit accrual, under each compensation, retirement,
vacation, paid time off, fringe or other welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries,
but not including any equity or equity-based compensation plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements, long-term incentive plans, defined benefit
pension plans or retiree medical plans (collectively, the "Parent Benefit
Plans") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, but solely to the extent service was credited to such employee
for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date and to the extent such credit would not result in a
duplication of benefits. To the extent reflected on financial statements of
the Company, Parent shall assume any and all vacation and paid time off
balances of Continuing Employees.

 



55 (b) For a period of not less than 18 months after the Closing Date (or if
shorter, the period of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee) (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee with
(i) (A) base salaries or base hourly rates and (B) annual target cash
incentive compensation opportunities (including cash bonuses and commissions)
at least equal, in the aggregate, to those provided immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) employee benefits (other than equity, equity-based or
nonqualified deferred compensation benefits, defined benefit plan benefits
and retiree welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date under the applicable Company Employee Plans. In addition,
during the Continuation Period, Parent shall assume and honor, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to assume and
honor, the terms of the Companys severance guidelines outlined in _Schedule
6.07(b)_ and provide the severance compensation and benefits required
thereunder to be provided to any Continuing Employee who incurs a qualifying
termination during such Continuation Period.

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent
Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit
Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the
same extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required
physical examinations and exclusions would not have applied under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to his or her commencement of participation in
such Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term disability and life
insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent permitted under the
terms and conditions of Parents applicable insurance contracts in effect as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of clarity, to
the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility conditions based on
periods of employment, _Section 6.07(a)_ shall control; and (ii) during the
plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, provide each Continuing Employee
and their eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid in such plan year that, and prior to the date that, such Continuing
Employee commences participation in such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any
applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under such Parent Benefit
Plan for the applicable calendar year, to the extent that such expenses were
recognized for such purposes under the comparable Company Employee Plan.

(d) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall honor, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with its terms, (i) each existing (as of the date hereof)
employment, change in control, retention, severance and termination protection
plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any current or former officer, director or employee of the
Company Made Available to Parent, and (ii) all obligations in effect as of the
Effective Time under any equity-based, bonus or compensation deferral plans,
programs or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries Made Available to
Parent. Parent acknowledges that the transaction contemplated hereby shall
constitute a "change in control" for purposes of each Company Employee Plan
that uses such term or a similar term.

 



56 (e) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to, comply with the federal
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, including any notice or
filing requirements thereunder, and any similar Applicable Law affecting any
site of employment of the Parent, Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries.

(f) This _Section 6.07_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
6.07_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever (including any third-party
beneficiary rights) under or by reason of this _Section 6.07_. No provision
of this _Section 6.07_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Continuing Employee or any current or former director or consultant of the
Parent, Company or any of their Subsidiaries in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter, except with respect to
_Section 6.11_. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.07_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any Continuing Employee any right to employment or continued employment for
any period or continued receipt of any specific benefit or compensation, shall
constitute an establishment of or amendment to or any other modification of,
or shall limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) from amending
or terminating, any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract or arrangement.

Section 6.08 _State Takeover Laws_. Each party and its Board of Directors
shall (1) use reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover law
(including Chapters 110C, 110D and 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws) or
similar Applicable Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if
any state takeover Applicable Law or similar Applicable Law becomes applicable
to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Applicable Law on this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.09 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement, including its obligations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

Section 6.10 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote any shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Shareholder Meeting, and will vote or cause
to be voted the shares of Merger Sub held by it or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, in favor of adoption of this Agreement.

 



57 Section 6.11 _Director and Officer Liability._

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such person currently covered by the Companys officers
and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this
_Section 6.11(a)_, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date hereof (the
"Current Premium") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporations
good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior
to the Effective Time, which policies provide such Persons currently covered
by such policies with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the amount paid for such prepaid
policies does not exceed 300% of the Current Premium. If such prepaid policies
have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each such
individual an "Indemnified Party") for any and all costs and
expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel, which shall be
advanced as they are incurred; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party shall
have made an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined
that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 6.11(b)_), judgments, fines, penalties or liabilities (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or reasonably incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any action,
suit or other Proceeding (whether civil or criminal) in which such Indemnified
Party may be involved or with which he or she may be threatened (regardless of
whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a named party,
including as a witness) (an "Indemnified Party Proceeding") (A) by reason of
such Indemnified Partys being or having been such director or officer or an
employee or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or
otherwise in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (B) arising out of such
Indemnified Partys service in connection with any other corporation
or organization for which he or she serves or has served as a director,
officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the Company
(including in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan), in each
of (A) or (B), whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such
position at the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is brought or
threatened and at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any
Indemnified Party Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the enforcement of this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party subject to the undertaking in this _Section 6.11_ to repay advanced
amounts), to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law; and (ii)
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to:
(x) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date hereof between
the

 



58  Company and any Indemnified Party as set forth in _Part 6.11(b)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule; and (y) any indemnification provision (including
advancement of expenses subject to the undertaking in this _Section 6.11_ to
repay advanced amounts) and any exculpation provision set forth in the Company
Articles or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. To the extent that
an Indemnified Party is a witness or participant other than as a named party
in an Indemnified Party Proceeding, the Indemnified Party will also be
compensated by Parent at the rate of $2,000 per day (or partial day);
_provided_ that the Indemnified Party will not be entitled to such _per diem_
compensation if he or she is employed as an officer of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation when such cooperation is sought. Parent shall pay all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by Indemnified
Parties in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided under
this _Section 6.11_. Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations
under the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such claim.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.11_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her legal Representatives, including any executor or trustee
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under any
articles of organization or bylaws, by contract or otherwise. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.11_ shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights
of any Indemnified Party unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by Applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnified Party shall have
consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly
agreed that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 6.11_; provided, however, that such rights of the Indemnified
Parties as third party beneficiaries under this _Section 6.11_ shall not
arise unless and until the Effective Time).

Section 6.12 _Reasonable Best Efforts._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-
actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities and the
making of all reasonably necessary,

 



59  proper or advisable registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of such steps as may be
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid a Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities, (ii) the
delivery of notices to, and the obtaining of consents or waivers from, Third
Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable) shall: (i)
promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, file any and all notices, reports and other documents required to be
filed by such party under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use reasonable best
efforts to promptly secure the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act; and (ii) promptly make all filings, and use
reasonable best efforts to timely obtain all consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances and approvals, and to cause the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods, as may be
required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws (to the extent required);
(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide such information as may
reasonably be requested by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") under the HSR Act or by any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as well as any information
required to be submitted to comply with a request for additional information
in order to commence or end a statutory waiting period; (iv) use reasonable
best efforts to cause to be taken, on a timely basis, all other actions
necessary or appropriate for the purpose of consummating and effectuating the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (v)
promptly take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all reasonable actions and
steps requested or required by any Governmental Authority as a condition to
granting any consent, permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals,
and to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable waiting
period and to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC and the DOJ, or
other Governmental Authorities of any other jurisdiction for which consents,
permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods are required with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the
Company and its Subsidiaries will only be required to take or commit to
take any such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, if such
action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction is binding on the
Company or its Subsidiaries, only in the event the Closing occurs. Parent
shall pay all filing fees under the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust
Laws, and the Company shall not be required to pay any fees or other payments
to any Governmental Authority in connection with any filings under the HSR Act
or such other filings as may be required under applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



60 (c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.12_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry or Proceeding by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry or Proceeding; (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any substantive communication to or from
the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Authority to the extent regarding the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or regarding
any such request, inquiry or Proceeding, and provide a copy of all substantive
written communications; and (iv) pull and re-file any notice under the HSR
Act only if the other parties hereto agree. Subject to Applicable Law, in
advance and to the extent practicable, each of Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, will consult the other on all substantive information relating
to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall give due consideration to all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that if review of
any information would be material in connection with any second request (or
similar process) such information shall be provided solely to those
individuals acting as outside antitrust counsel for the other parties (
_provided_ that such counsel shall not disclose such information to such
other parties and shall enter into a joint defense agreement with the
providing party). In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental
Authority or by any Applicable Law, in connection with any such request,
inquiry or Proceeding in respect of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each party hereto will permit authorized
Representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry or Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made
or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request,
inquiry or Proceeding.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent agrees to
take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid, eliminate or resolve each
and every impediment and obtain all clearances, consents, approvals and
waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be required by any Governmental
Authority, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable (and
in any event no later than three Business Days prior to the End Date),
including (i) committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale, license, transfer, assignment or other
disposition of assets or businesses of Parent or the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating, relinquishing, modifying,
transferring, assigning, restructuring, or waiving existing agreements,
collaborations, relationships, ventures, contractual rights, obligations or
other arrangements of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
and (iii) creating or consenting to create any relationships, ventures,
contractual rights, obligations, behavioral undertakings or other arrangements
of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case,
to enter, or offer to enter, into agreements and stipulate to the entry of
an Order or file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, by consenting to such action by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned
upon consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) (each a "Divestiture Action") as may be necessary or
required, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or
lift, any Order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

 



61  Agreement, and to ensure that no Governmental Authority with the authority
to clear, authorize or otherwise approve consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, fails to do so as promptly
as practicable and in any event no later than three Business Days prior to the
End Date. Parent and the Company shall cooperate in any proposal, negotiation,
or offer to commit and to effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, any and all Divestiture Actions or otherwise to offer to take or
offer to commit (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect) to take
any Divestiture Action as may be required to resolve any Governmental
Authoritys objections to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(e) In the event that any Proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such Proceeding
seeks, or would reasonably be expected to seek, to prevent consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub shall take any and all action to resolve any such Proceeding and
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other and
use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest any such Proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall they permit
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including portfolio company
Affiliates) to, acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business,
Person or division thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture,
collaboration or otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be
expected to increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance,
consent, approval or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys consultation and participation rights described
above, Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition
or investment review clearances as promptly as practicable, and in any event
prior to the End Date, and shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review clearances.

 

Section 6.13 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) notify
Parent in writing of, and shall give Parent the opportunity to review and
timely comment on all filings and responses to be made by the Company in
connection therewith (which comments the Company shall in good faith take into
account), and participate and consult in the defense and settlement of, any
Shareholder Litigation, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect
to the status of any Shareholder Litigation. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall not agree to such settlement or other compromise or
arrangement without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company will give the Parent reasonably
prompt (and no later than two

 



62  Business Days) of any derivative demand made pursuant to Section 7.42 of the
MBCA related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
shall consult with the Parent in connection with, and prior to, any
determination made by the independent directors of the Company Board or any
committee of independent directors pursuant to Section 7.44 of the MBCA.
Without otherwise limiting the Indemnified Parties rights with regard to the
right to counsel, following the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to continue to retain Goodwin Procter LLP or such other counsel
selected by such Indemnified Parties prior to the Effective Time to defend
any Shareholder Litigation.

Section 6.14 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and
Parent, and thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_ that (i) a
party hereto may, without the prior consent of the other parties hereto, issue
such press release or make such public statement as may be required by
Applicable Law or Order or the applicable rules of Nasdaq if it has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other parties hereto and
to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time
such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or
made, (ii) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation
with respect to communication that are (1) principally directed to employees,
customers, partners or vendors so long as such communications are consistent
with previous releases, public disclosures or public statements jointly by
the parties (or individually, if approved the other party), or (2) relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, Adverse Recommendation Change effected in accordance
with  _Section 6.03_ or "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
and permitted by _Section 6.03(c)_.

 

Section 6.15 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Parent and the Company agree that,
in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers and
directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Merger, both prior to
and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that such Persons not be
subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, for that compensatory and retentive
purpose, agree to the provisions of this _Section 6.16_. Promptly after the
date hereof, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

 



63 Section 6.17 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable (as reasonably determined by Parent and Merger Sub) to arrange,
obtain and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions (including,
to the extent required, the full exercise of any "flex" provisions contained
in the Fee Letter) described in the Financing Commitment Letters, and shall
not permit any amendment, supplement or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision under, the Financing Commitment Letters or the Fee
Letter if such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver, (A) with respect
to the Financing Commitment Letters or Fee Letter, reduces (or could
reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount
of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount unless (x) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing
is increased by a corresponding amount or the Debt Financing is otherwise
made available at Closing to fund such fees or original issue discount and (y)
after giving effect to such reduction and any of the transactions referred to
in clause (x) above, the representation and warranty set forth in _Section
5.09_ shall be true and correct), or (B) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the
Financing, or imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands,
amends or modifies any other provision of the Financing Commitment Letters or
the Fee Letter, in each case of clauses (A) and (B), in a manner that would
(x) reasonably be expected to prevent or make less likely the funding of
the Financing in an amount necessary to fund the Required Amounts on the
Closing Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Financing Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect
thereto ( _provided_ that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this _Section 6.17(a)_, Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents). Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any amendment, supplement,
waiver, consent, modification or replacement in respect of the Debt Commitment
Letter (other than an amendment to add additional lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners and agents) and the Fee Letter. Parent and Merger Sub shall not
agree to the withdrawal, termination, repudiation, reduction or rescission of
any commitment in respect of the Debt Financing, and shall not release or
consent to the termination of the obligations of the financing sources under
the Debt Commitment Letter, in each case, without the prior written consent of
the Company, to the extent such withdrawal, termination, repudiation,
reduction or rescission is in an amount such that the net proceeds of the
Financing would not be in an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amounts at
Closing or the Parent would not be able to make the representation set forth
in _Section 5.08_ hereof as of the date of such withdrawal, termination,
repudiation, reduction or rescission after giving effect thereto. Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) references to "Financing"
shall include the

 



64  financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as permitted to
be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 6.17(a)_,

contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section 6.17(a)_ and (iii)
references to "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this _Section
6.17(a)_.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, taking into account the Marketing
Period, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable (as reasonably determined by Parent and Merger Sub) to
arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms (including the market
"flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter) and subject only to the
conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters, including using
reasonable best efforts (taking into account the Marketing Period to the
extent reasonably applicable) (A) to maintain in effect the Financing
Commitment Letters, (B) to promptly negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including, as necessary, agreeing to any requested changes to the
commitments thereunder in accordance with any "flex" provisions) contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter; (C) to promptly prepare the
necessary offering circulars, private placement memoranda, or other offering
documents, rating agency materials and other marketing materials with respect
to the Debt Financing and to commence the marketing and/or syndication
activities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement; (D) to promptly satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Debt Commitment Letter and
such definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity Commitment Letter and to
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing and (E) to promptly,
diligently and fully enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment Letters

the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to use, and shall use reasonable best efforts to have each

satisfied; (C) requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to incur any liability

upon and subject to, the Closing). In no event shall the Company be in breach
of this Agreement because of the failure to deliver any historical financials

consultation with the Company): a tender offer, consent solicitation and/or
delivery of a redemption notice contemporaneously with Closing, in each case,

Section 9.02 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. The representations
and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 9.03  _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; provided, however, that without the further approval of the
Companys shareholders, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or given
after the Shareholder Approval that requires the approval of the shareholders
of the Company under

 



75  Applicable Law unless the required further approval is obtained; _provided_
, _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
_Section 8.03_, this  _Section 9.03_, _Section 9.04(c)_, _Section 9.05_,
_Section 9.06_, _Section 9.07_ and _Section 9.08_ (and any other provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that is materially adverse to (i) a Debt Financing Related Party
without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources or (ii) any
Parent Related Party without the prior written consent of such Parent Related
Party.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by
Applicable Law.

Section 9.04 _Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_;

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_; or

 

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ or
_Section 8.01(e)_ and (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
directly to the Companys shareholders or shall have been otherwise publicly
disclosed and, in each case, not withdrawn before receipt of the Shareholder
Approval and (C) within 12 months after the date of such termination, the
Company consummates or enters into a definitive agreement providing for a
transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B)
above), which is subsequently consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of
this subsection (iii), each reference to "20% or more" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "more than 50%");

then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer
of same-day funds (x) in the case of  _Section 9.04(b)(i)_, within two
Business Days after such termination, (y) in the case of _Section
9.04(b)(ii)_, substantially concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(h)_ and (z) in the case of _Section
9.04(b)(iii)_, substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the
Company under this _Section 9.04(b)_ shall be payable only once with respect
to _Section 9.04(b)_ and not in duplication, even though such payment may be
payable under one or both provisions hereof. In the event that Parent shall
become entitled to receive full payment pursuant to this _Section 9.04(b)_,
the receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by

 



76  Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for such termination, the Company shall have no
further liability, whether pursuant to a claim at law or in equity, to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
Proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates for
damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement (other than equitable relief to require payment of the Company
Termination Fee), any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any matters forming the basis for such termination; _provided_ that if the
Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee and Parent and/or Merger Sub
commences a suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against the
Company for the Company Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then the
Company shall pay Parent and Merger Sub their costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the Company Termination Fee at the "prime
rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding).

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.01(i)_ or _Section 8.01(f)_, then Parent shall pay the Company the Parent
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds on the first Business Day
following such termination. In the event that the Company shall become
entitled to receive full payment pursuant to this  _Section 9.04(c)_, the
receipt of the Parent Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages
for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, and except for the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section 6.17(e)_ and this  _Section
9.04(c)_ (collectively, the "Parent Expenses") together with any Recovery
Costs, neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates or
Representatives (including any Debt Financing Related Parties and Parent
Related Parties) shall have any further liability, whether pursuant to a claim
at law or in equity, to the Company or any of its Affiliates under this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for
such termination, and the Company shall not be entitled to bring or maintain
any Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives (including any Debt Financing Related Party or
Parent Related Party) for damages or any equitable relief arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any matters forming the basis for such termination (other than
equitable relief to require payment of the Parent Termination Fee and/or any
Parent Expenses); _provided_ that if Parent fails to pay the Parent
Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and the Company commences a suit
which results in a final, non-appealable judgment against Parent for the
Parent Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses, or any portions thereof,
then Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket
attorneys fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Parent Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses at the "prime
rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on
the date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding) (the "Recovery Costs").

 



77 (d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 9.04_ are an integral part of the
Agreement, (ii) the damages under circumstances where a Company Termination
Fee or Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and difficult to
ascertain as of the date of this Agreement and therefore, the amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 9.04_ are not a penalty but rather constitute
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount to compensate Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Agreement, and (iii) without
the agreements contained in this  _Section 9.04_, the parties hereto would
not have entered into this Agreement.

Section 9.05 _Assignment; Benefit_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by
any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ that (i) prior to
the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may assign their rights and obligations
pursuant to this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to any Affiliate of
Parent, provided such assignment shall not impair, delay or prevent the
consummation of the Merger, (ii) at or after the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub may assign this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any
lender providing financing to Parent and (iii) after the Effective Time,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may assign this Agreement, including any
or all rights, interests or obligations hereunder, to any Person, including
in connection with a merger or consolidation involving Parent or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. No assignment by any party hereto shall relieve such
party of any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or
their respective heirs, successors, executors, administrators and assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement, except for the provisions of _Article 2_ concerning payment of the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, _Section 6.11_ and _Section 6.17(e)_, which
provisions shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting
therefrom who shall be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who following
the Closing may enforce the covenants contained therein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to the Effective Time, the rights and remedies
conferred on the Companys equity holders pursuant to _Article 2_
concerning payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration may only be enforced
by the Company acting on the behalf of the Companys equity holders (including
holders of Company Equity Awards); _provided_ , _further_ that the Debt
Financing Sources may enforce (solely as such provision relates to such Debt
Financing Sources and Debt Financing Related Parties in such capacity as third
party beneficiary) on behalf of the Debt Financing Related Parties (and each
is an intended third party beneficiary of) the provisions of _Section 8.03_,
_Section 9.03_, _Section 9.04(c)_, this _Section 9.05_, _Section 9.06_,
_Section 9.07_ and _Section 9.08_; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the
Parent may enforce on behalf of the Parent Related Parties the provisions of
_Section 8.03_, _Section 9.03_, _Section 9.04(c)_ and this _Section 9.05_.

 



78 Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto acknowledges and
irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding, whether in contract or tort, at law
or in equity or otherwise, involving any Debt Financing Related Party arising
out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
transactions contemplated by the Debt Financing shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Section 9.07 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding brought by any party to this Agreement with respect to this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition
and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder brought by another party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Business Litigation Session of the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts for Suffolk County, Massachusetts (or if such court does not
have jurisdiction, any state court located within the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, or if those courts do not have jurisdiction, then any federal
court of the United States located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts).
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than
the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding brought by any party to this Agreement with respect to
this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this  _Section 9.07_, (ii) any claim that it or
its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by the Applicable Law, any claim that (A) such suit, action
or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that, subject to any available appeal
rights, any decision, order, or judgment issued by such above named courts
shall be binding and enforceable, and irrevocably agrees to abide by any such
decision, order, or judgment. Each of the parties hereto agrees that service
of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective
if such process is given as a notice in accordance with _Section 9.01._

 

(b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT BRING OR SUPPORT ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF
ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION,
WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE,
AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING

 



79  ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR DEBT
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER IN ANY FORUM
OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOURTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW
YORK OR ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN AND THE
APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF, AND THE PROVISIONS OF _SECTION 9.08_ RELATING TO THE
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUCH ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM,
CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD PARTY CLAIM.

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY
DEBT FINANCING RELATED PARTY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE DEBT FINANCING).

Section 9.09  _Specific Performance._

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages
or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such harm. The
parties hereto agree that unless and until this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ and any dispute over the right
to termination has been finally resolved, (i) the parties hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than Parents and Merger Subs obligation to effect
the Closing, which shall be governed by the next sentence), without bond or
other security being required, this being in addition to any remedy to which
they are entitled pursuant to _Section 8.02_, _Section 8.03_ or  _Section
9.04_ and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and without
that right, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary
herein, the Company shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to effect the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth herein
if and only if each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_
that each such condition is then capable of being satisfied at the Closing)
have been satisfied or waived at the time the Closing would have occurred but
for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (B) the Debt Financing
(or any alternative debt financing contemplated by Section 6.17(b)) is
available to be funded at the Closing and has been funded or will be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (C) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing (or any
alternative debt financing contemplated by Section 6.17(b)) are funded, then
the Company will take such actions as are within its control to effect the
Closing (such clauses (A), (B) and (C), together, the "Specific
Performance Conditions"). For the

 



80  avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or
seek to enforce specifically Parents right to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded or to complete the Merger unless either the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other of such parties has an adequate remedy at law or that
any such injunction or award of specific performance or other equitable relief
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason; _provided_ that solely with
respect to the equitable remedy to specifically enforce Parents or Merger
Subs obligation to effect the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub may oppose the
granting of specific performance only on the basis that one of the
Specific Performance Conditions has not been satisfied. The parties hereto
further agree that (x) following the Companys valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_, the Company shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions from a court of competent jurisdiction as set
forth in _Section 9.07_ to enforce specifically Parents and Merger Subs
surviving obligations herein, including with respect to the payment of
monetary damages under _Section 8.02_ or the payments of the Parent
Termination Fee and/or any Parent Expenses and/or any Recovery Costs to which
the Company is entitled under _Section 9.04(c)_, and (y) following Parents
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_,
Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions from a court of
competent jurisdiction as set forth in _Section 9.07_ to enforce specifically
the Companys surviving obligations herein, including with respect to the
payment of monetary damages under _Section 8.02_ or the payments of the
Company Termination Fee to which Parent is entitled under _Section 9.04(b)_.

 

(b) The parties hereto further agree that (i) subject to _Section 9.04(b)_
and _Section 9.04(c)_, by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
9.09_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.09_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any partys
right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 9.09_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time. In
any Proceeding seeking monetary damages against a party or to compel a party
to specifically perform its obligations hereunder, the non-prevailing party in
such Proceeding (after a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction) shall promptly reimburse the prevailing party its
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees and
disbursements) in connection with such Proceeding.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this

 



81  Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such a determination, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply in
all respects with each of the representations, warranties, covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Merger Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As a material inducement
to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees full
performance and payment by Merger Sub of each of the covenants, obligations
and undertakings required to be performed by Merger Sub under this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to all terms,
conditions and limitations contained in this Agreement, and hereby represents,
acknowledges and agrees that any such breach of any such representation and
warranty or default in the performance of any such covenant, obligation,
agreement or undertaking of Merger Sub shall also be deemed to be a breach or
default of Parent, and the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its
sole discretion, to pursue any and all available remedies it may have arising
out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against either or both of
Parent and Merger Sub in the first instance. As applicable, references in
this _Section 9.11_ to "Merger Sub" shall also include the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.12 _Entire Agreement; No Reliance; Access to Information_.

 

(a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits and schedules
to this Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Financing Commitment
Letters and the Guarantees constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect
thereto. 

(b) Each party hereto agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in _Article 4_ and _Article 5_ of this Agreement,
neither the Company, Parent nor Merger Sub makes any other representations or
warranties and each hereby disclaims any other representations or warranties
made by itself or any of its Representatives, with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to any other party
or any other partys Representatives of any document or other information with
respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any otherwise express representations
and warranties made by the parties in this Agreement, each of Parent and
Merger Sub agrees that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make or
has made any representation or warranty with respect to (i) any projections,
forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets or future revenues, expenses or
expenditures, future results of operations (or any component thereof), future
cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the future
business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or Made Available to it, or
(ii) any other information, statements or documents heretofore or

 



82  hereafter delivered to or made available to it, including the information in
the electronic data room of the Company, with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the business, operations or affairs of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent and as expressly covered by a
representation and warranty made in _Article 4_ of this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an
opportunity to discuss the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
the management of the Company, (b) has had reasonable access to (i) the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the documents
provided by the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and
received answers from officers of the Company and (d) has conducted its own
independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
their respective businesses and the transactions contemplated hereby, and has
not relied on any representation, warranty or statement by any Person on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Article 4_ of
this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to develop estimates, projections,
forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information with which
Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full
responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-
looking information furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans
and other forward-looking information), and, for the avoidance of doubt, that
Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company or any of its
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
other Representatives with respect thereto.

 

Section 9.13 _Rules of Construction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it
has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each party
and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and preparation
of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all
drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed the work
product of all of the parties and may not be construed against any party by
reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any
legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no application
and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto, and any
controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of drafting or preparation.

 

Section 9.14 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). Signatures to this
Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission, by

 



83  electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other electronic means designed to
preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will be
deemed to have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document
bearing the original signatures.
