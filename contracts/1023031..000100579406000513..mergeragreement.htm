the terms and subject to the conditions of this  Agreement, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,  Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the  Company:

 

 

 

(a) _Company  Common Stock_.   Each share of the common stock, no par value
per share, of the Company  ("Company  Common Stock")  issued  and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares 
of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b),  will be 
canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive  an amount of cash equal to twenty-one dollars and twenty-five cents
($21.25),  without interest (such amount of cash hereinafter referred to as
the "Merger  Consideration")  upon  surrender of the certificate
representing such share of Company Common Stock  in  the manner provided in
Section 2.2  (or in  the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an  affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided
in Section 2.2(e)).

 

 

(b) _Cancellation_.   Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or
Merger Sub or any direct  or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the  holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, be canceled and retired without payment  of any consideration
therefor and cease to exist.

 

 

(c) _Capital  Stock of Merger Sub_.   Each share of common stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become, and shall  represent, one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the  Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares  so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock  of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Adjustments  to Merger Consideration_.   The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate  effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any  dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),  reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with  respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof  and
prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

2.2 _Surrender  of Certificates_. 

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.   Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the  Company to act as the paying agent (the
"Paying  Agent")  in the  Merger. Upon the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to, make available to the Paying Agent
for exchange in accordance  with this Article II, the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section  2.1(a)  in  exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock. Any cash deposited  with  the Paying Agent
("Exchange  Fund")  shall  be held for the benefit of the Company\'s
shareholders as of immediately prior  to  the Effective Time.  The  Paying
Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund on a daily  basis
as directed by Parent pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to  the 
Company shareholders. Earnings from such investments shall become part of
the  Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to
Company  shareholders pursuant to this Article II shall be promptly paid to 
Parent.

 

 

(b) _Surrender  Procedures_.   As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time, Parent shall  instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of the Effective  Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the "Certificates")  which  immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of  Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive  the  cash constituting the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a):  (i) a  letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery  shall  be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only  upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such  form  and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)  customary
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates  in 
exchange for cash constituting the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of 
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or 
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto  and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent,  the  holder of record of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange  therefor the cash constituting the Merger
Consideration, and the Certificates  so  surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding  Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate  purposes, to evidence the
ownership of the Merger Consideration into which  such  shares of Company
Common Stock shall have been so converted.

 

 

(c) _Transfer  Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed,  and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers
of the shares  of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. All
Merger Consideration  paid upon the surrender of Certificates representing
shares of Company Common  Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid  in  full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Company Common  Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving  Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided  in  this Article II, subject to
Section 2.2(d).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Termination  of Exchange Fund; No Liability_.   Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders  of  Certificates
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request  of Parent,
be delivered to Parent or otherwise according to the instruction  of 
Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such 
Certificates in compliance with this Section 2.2  shall  after such delivery
to Parent look only to the Parent (subject to abandoned  property, escheat or
other similar Laws) solely as general creditors for the  cash constituting
the Merger Consideration (which shall not accrue interest)  pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)  with  respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 2.2,  none of  Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any  holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts
delivered to a public official  pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any  amounts remaining unclaimed by Company
shareholders two (2) years after the  Effective Time (or such earlier date,
immediately prior to such time when the  amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental  Entity) shall become, to the
extent permitted by Law, the property of Parent,  free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled  thereto. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Laws"  shall  mean any law (including common law),
statute, ordinance, code, regulation,  rule,  judgment, order, decree,
injunction, arbitration award, decision, ruling or  other pronouncement, of
any Governmental Entity.

 

 

(e) _Withholding  Rights_.   Each of the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to  deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable  pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Common  Stock or Company Options such amounts as may
be required to be deducted or  withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and  the  rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the "Code")  or  under any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law or under any other  applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, the  amount of such consideration shall be treated for
all purposes under this  Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such consideration would  otherwise have been paid.

 

 

(f) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.   In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the  Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed  Certificates,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder  thereof, such
cash constituting Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance  thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to  deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against  any  claim that may be made against Parent, the Company
or the Paying Agent with  respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or  destroyed.

 

 

2.3 _Further  Action_.   At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the  Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name  and  on behalf of the Company and Merger
Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments  or assurances and to take and do,
in the name and on behalf of the Company  and  Merger Sub, any other actions
and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record  or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest  in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be  acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,  the  Merger.

incorporation or organization and each has the requisite  power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on  its  business as

failures as could not reasonably be expected to be material to any of the 
Company or its Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly  qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing in  every jurisdiction where the properties, owned, leased or

"Subsidiary,"  when  used with respect to any party, shall mean any
corporation, association,  business entity, partnership, limited liability
company or other Person of  which  such party, either alone or together with

than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power  of such Person or (ii) is
entitled, by Contract or otherwise, to elect, appoint  or designate directors

benefit plan or legally  binding commitment, arrangement or undertaking of
any nature, as in effect  as of  the date hereof or as may hereinafter be

6  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Governing  Documents_.   The Company has delivered to Parent (i) a true
and correct copy of the charter  and bylaws of the Company, each as amended
to date (collectively, the "Company  Governing Documents")  and  (ii) the
charter and bylaws, or like organizational documents (collectively, 
"Subsidiary  Governing Documents"),  of  each of its Subsidiaries, and each
such instrument is in full force and effect.  The Company is not in violation
of any of the provisions of the Company  Governing Documents and each of its
Subsidiaries is not in violation of its  respective Subsidiary Governing
Documents.

 

 

(c) _Subsidiaries_.   Section 3.1(c)  of the  Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth the name of each Subsidiary of the  Company. Except as set forth
in Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure  Schedule, the Company is the
direct or indirect owner of all of the outstanding  shares of capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, each such  Subsidiary and all
such shares have been duly authorized, validly issued and  are  fully paid
and nonassessable, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,  charges,
encumbrances, options and security interests of any kind or nature 
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"),  except  for Permitted Liens and
restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws.  Other than the
Subsidiaries of the Company and securities in its investment  portfolio,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any capital  stock of,
or other equity or voting interests of any nature in, or any interest 
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock of, or other
equity  or voting interests of any nature in, any other Person.

 

 

3.2 _Capital  Structure_. 

 

 

(a) _Capital  Stock_.   The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of: (i) 100,000,000  shares of Company Common Stock, no par value per share
and (ii) 10,000,000  shares of undesignated preferred stock, no par value per
share (the "Company  Preferred Stock").  As of  the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the date hereof: (i)  20,347,675 shares of
Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding and (ii)  no shares of
Company Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding. No shares  of  Company
Common Stock are owned or held by any Subsidiary of the Company. All 
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued,  fully paid and non-assessable and are not subject to preemptive
rights created  by statute, the Company Governing Documents, or any agreement
to which the  Company is a party or by which it is bound.

 

 

(b) _Company  Options_.   As of the close of business on the date hereof:
(i) 45,000 shares of  Company Common Stock are issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding options,  vested and unvested, to purchase Company Common Stock
under the Company\'s 1996  Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the "1996 
Plan")  and  907,200 shares of Company Common Stock are issuable upon the
exercise of  outstanding options, vested and unvested, to purchase Company
Common Stock  under  the Company\'s 2003  Equity  Incentive Plan (the
"2003  Plan"  and  together with the 1996 Plan,  the "Option  Plans") 
(such  options, whether payable in cash, shares or otherwise granted under or
pursuant  to the Option Plans are referred to in this Agreement as "Company 
Options"),  the  weighted average exercise price of such Company Options is
nineteen dollars  and  ninety-one cents ($19.91), and 45,000 of such Company
Options under the 1996  Plan and 484,700 of such Company Options under the
2003 Plan are vested and  exercisable; (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock
are available for  future grant under the 1996 Plan and 744,000 shares of
Company Common Stock  are  available for future grant under the 2003 Plan;
and (iii) no shares of  Company Common Stock were subject to issuance
pursuant to outstanding Company  Options outside of the Option Plans. Section
3.2(b)(i)  of  the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each
outstanding Company  Option, including: (a) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject  to  such Company Option, (b) the exercise price of
such Company Option, (c) the  date  on which such Company Option was granted
or issued, (d) the Option Plan under  which such Company Option was issued
and whether such Company Option is an  "incentive  stock option"  (as 
defined in Section 422 of the Code) or a nonqualified stock option, (e) for 
each  Company Option, whether such Company Option is held by a Person who is
not  an  employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (f) the
applicable  vesting schedule, if any, and the extent to which such Company
Option is vested  and exercisable as of the date hereof; and (g) the date on
which such Company  Option expires. The Company has delivered to Parent a
correlated list of names  of the holders of such Company Options. All shares
of Company Common Stock  subject to issuance under the Option Plans, upon
issuance on the terms and  conditions specified in the instruments pursuant
to which they are issuable,  would be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable. Except  as set forth in Section 3.2(b)(iii)  of 
the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no commitments or agreements of 
any  character to which the Company is bound obligating the Company to
accelerate  the  vesting or exercisability of any Company Option as a result
of the Merger  (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events).  There are no outstanding or authorized stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit  participation or other similar rights
with respect to the Company.  The per  share exercise price of each Company
Option is not (and is not deemed to be)  less than the fair market value of a
share of Company Common Stock as of the  date of grant of such Company
Option. All grants of Company Options were  properly approved by the board of
directors of the Company (or a duly authorized  committee or subcommittee
thereof) in compliance with all Laws and recorded  on  the Company
Financials in accordance with GAAP, and no such grants involved  any "back 
dating", "forward  dating"  or  similar practices that date any Company
Option as of any date other that the  date of its actual grant.

 

 

(c) _Voting  Debt_.   Except as set forth in Section 3.2(c)  of the 
Company Disclosure Schedule, no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) having the right
to vote on any  matters on which shareholders may vote (or which is
convertible into, or  exchangeable for, securities having such right) or (ii)
the value of which  is  any way based upon or derived from capital or voting
stock of the Company,  are  issued or outstanding as of the date hereof
(collectively, "Voting  Debt").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Other  Securities_.   Except as otherwise set forth in Section
3.2(b),  Section 3.2(c)  or  Section 3.2(d)  of the  Company Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no securities,  options, warrants,
calls, rights, contracts, commitments, agreements,  instruments,
arrangements, understandings, obligations or undertakings of any  kind to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which  any  of
them is bound obligating (or purporting to obligate) the Company or any  of 
its Subsidiaries to (including on a deferred basis) issue, deliver or sell, 
or  cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock,  Voting Debt, other voting securities or any securities convertible
into shares  of capital stock, Voting Debt or other voting securities of the
Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries, or obligating the Company or any of

All such required registration  statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other  documents, as each of the foregoing have been
amended since the time of their  filing, (including those that the Company
may file subsequent to the date  hereof) are referred to herein as the

Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared  in  accordance with, and complied in
all material respects with, the requirements  of  the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities  Act"),  or the  Exchange Act, as the
case may be, and, in each case, the rules and regulations  promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports and (ii) did  not  at the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior  to  the
date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue 
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be 
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the 
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None 
of  the Company\'s Subsidiaries is subject to the reporting requirements of
Sections  13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company has delivered to
Parent complete  and correct copies of all amendments and modifications to
the Company SEC  Reports drafted prior to the date of this Agreement that
have not yet been  filed  by the Company with the SEC, but which are
required to be filed and all  Contracts and other documents that previously
had been filed by the Company  with  the SEC and are currently in effect.
The Company has delivered or provided  access to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all correspondence between  the SEC, on the one hand, and
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the  other, since August 12,
2003, including all SEC comment letters and responses  to  such comment
letters by or on behalf of the Company. To the Company\'s Knowledge,  as of
the date hereof and except as described in Section 3.4(a) of the Company\'s 
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company SEC Reports is the subject of
ongoing  SEC review or outstanding SEC comment. Each of the principal
executive officer  of the Company and the principal financial officer of the
Company (or each  former principal executive officer of the Company and each
former principal  financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has made
all certifications  required by Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange

form in all material respects with the published rules and  regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance  with United
States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")  applied  on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be  indicated
in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial 
statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any
successor  form under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly and accurately
presented in all  material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its  consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and the  consolidated results of the Company\'s operations and cash
flows for the periods  indicated (except that unaudited, interim financial
statements were or will  be  subject to normal, recurring year end
adjustments). The consolidated balance  sheet of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30,  2006  contained in the
Company SEC Reports is hereinafter referred to as the "Company  Balance
Sheet."  Except  as disclosed in the Company Financials, since the date of
the Company Balance  Sheet, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred any  liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of
a nature required  to  be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet or in
the related notes to the  consolidated financial statement prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for  (i) liabilities incurred since the date of
the Company Balance Sheet in the  ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and (ii) liabilities  incurred in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated  hereby. The Company has not had
any material dispute with any of its auditors  regarding accounting matters
or policies during any of its past three (3) full  fiscal years or during the
current fiscal year-to-date. The books and records  of  the Company and each
Subsidiary have been, and are being, maintained in  accordance with
applicable legal and accounting requirements in all material  respects, and
the Company Financials are consistent with such books and records  in all
material respects. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is  a 
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, 
off-balance sheet partnership or any similar off-balance sheet Contract
relating  to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or
any of its  Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including  any  structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose
Person, on the other  hand, or any "off-balance  sheet arrangements"  (as

Statements have been or may be  required to be filed ("SAP"),  the 
financial position of the related Insurance Subsidiary at the date of each 
such  statement and the results of the related Insurance Subsidiary\'s
operations  for  each such referenced period.

 

 

(iii) The  amounts shown in the Statutory Statements as reserves and
liabilities for past  and future Insurance Contract claims and expenses under
Insurance Contracts,  were computed (i) in all material respects in
accordance with generally accepted  actuarial standards consistently applied
as in effect on their respective dates,  (ii) on the basis of actuarial
assumptions that were in accordance with those  called for in policy
provisions, (iii) in compliance with applicable Law in  all  material
respects; and (iv) on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods 
consistent in all material respects with those used to compute the
corresponding  items in the Statutory Statements. Such amounts shown on

whether or not material, that involves the  Company's management or other
employees who have a significant role in the  Company's internal control over
financial reporting. There does not exist any  fraud, whether or not
material, that involved the Company's management or other  employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal control over  financial
reporting..

 

 

(f) The  Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures  required by Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act to
ensure that  all  material information relating to the Company and its

and consistent with past practice),  except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in material liability.  Except as set forth in Section

except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable statute,  and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever represented,  promised or
contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Employee/Service

or  any other Person that such Employee(s)/Service Provider(s) or other
Person  would  be provided with post-termination or retiree life insurance,

**AND  MERGER SUB**

 

 

Parent  and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company, subject to the
exceptions  specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure schedule

thereof) supplied by the  Company to Parent dated as of the date hereof (the
"Parent  Disclosure Schedule"),  as  follows:

 

 

4.1 _Organization;  Capitalization_.   Merger Sub is a wholly-owned direct
subsidiary of Parent. Each of Parent and  Merger Sub is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good  standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized, except  for  such failures as could
not reasonably be expected to adversely effect the  ability of any of them to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.  Parent has delivered to the
Company a true and correct copy of the charter  and  bylaws, each as amended
to the date of this Agreement, of Merger Sub, and such  charter and bylaws
contain such provisions regarding exculpation,  indemnification and
advancement of expenses as required by Section 6.10(a)  hereof. The
authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 1,000,000 shares  of  common
stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent  Common Stock").  Other  than in
connection with the equity financing as described on Section 4.1 of  the 
Parent Disclosure Schedule (the "Equity  Financing"),  and  pursuant to
Section 6.11(b), Parent is not obligated to issue, deliver or sell  any
shares of Parent Common Stock or any security, option, warrant, call, right, 
commitment, agreement, instrument or arrangement by its terms convertible

4.2 _Authority;  No Conflict; Necessary Consents_.

 

 

  (a) _Authority_.   Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and  authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the transactions  contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery by each of
Parent and Merger  Sub  of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby  have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of  Parent and Merger Sub and no other action is
required on the part of Parent  or  Merger Sub to authorize the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or to  consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, subject  only to the filing of the Articles
of Merger with the Secretary of State of  the  State of Tennessee in
accordance with applicable provisions of Tennessee Law.  This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub  and, assuming due
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,  constitutes the
valid and binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub,  enforceable against
each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,  subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or  other Laws
relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors  generally and
to general principles of equity.

 

 

(b) _No  Conflict_.   The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement and the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not (i) conflict  with  or violate any provision of their respective
certificates of incorporation  or  bylaws, (ii) subject to compliance with
the requirements set forth in Section  4.2(c),  conflict with or violate any
material Laws applicable to Parent or Merger Sub  or  by which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective properties or assets  (whether tangible
or intangible) is bound or affected or (iii) result in any  breach of or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of  time  or
both would become a default) under, or materially impair Parent\'s or Merger 
Sub\'s rights or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub, alter the rights 
or  obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of 
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the 
creation of a Lien on any of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger
Sub  pursuant to, any material contract of Parent or Merger Sub; except, in
the  case  of each of the preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), for any
conflict,  violation, beach, default, impairment, alteration, giving of
rights or Lien  which would not materially adversely affect the ability of
the parties hereto  to  consummate the Merger within the time frame in which
the Merger would otherwise  be consummated in the absence of such conflict,
violation, beach, default,  impairment, alteration, giving of rights or Lien.

 

 

(c) _Necessary  Consents_.   No consent, approval, order, authorization,
registration, declaration or filing  with any Governmental Entity, or any
third party, is required to be made or  obtained by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery  of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub or the consummation of the Merger  and  the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) the Necessary Consents  and  (ii) such
consents, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, 
declarations and filings which, if not obtained or made, would not
materially  adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger  within the time frame in which the Merger would
otherwise be consummated in  the  absence of the need for such consent,
approval, order, authorization,  registration, declaration or filing.

 

 

4.3 _Financing_.   The financing of the transactions contemplated hereby
will consist of a  combination of Equity  Financing  and debt  financing
(which includes (x) amending the Premium Facility to allow the Merger  and
the transactions contemplated in connection therewith and (y) funds loaned 
to the Company upon the Closing) (the "Debt  Financing",  and  together
with the Equity Financing, the "Financing").  Section 4.3 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule sets forth true, accurate and  complete copies of
executed commitment letters and amendment to the Premium  Facility (the
"Financing  Commitments")  pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, the parties  thereto have committed to provide Parent
with the Financing. As of the date  hereof, the Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and have not  been  withdrawn or terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect. Each  of  the Financing
Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and  binding
obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub,  the 
other parties thereto. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, 
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of 
Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Financing
Commitments.  Parent and/or Merger Sub have fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other  fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or
before the date  of  this Agreement. The proceeds from the Financing as
contemplated by the Financing  Commitments, together with cash on hand of the
Company and its Subsidiaries  anticipated to be available at the Effective
Time, constitute all of the  financing required to be provided by Parent for
the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby, and are sufficient
for the satisfaction of  all  of Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligations
under this Agreement, including the  payment of the Merger Consideration and
the payment of all associated costs  and  expenses (including any
refinancing of indebtedness of Parent or the Company  required in connection
therewith). The Financing Commitments contain all of  the  conditions
precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the  Financing
available to Parent on the terms therein.

inclusion or incorporation by reference  in  the Proxy Statement will not
contain, on the date of the mailing to the  Company\'s shareholders and at
the time of the Shareholders\' Meeting, any untrue  statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to  be  stated therein or

Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by Parent which is 
required to be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement, Parent

satisfy on a timely basis all conditions  applicable to Parent in the
Financing Agreements. If any portion of the  Financing becomes unavailable in
the manner or from the sources contemplated  in  the Financing Commitments,
Parent shall promptly notify the Company and shall  use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from  alternative sources;
_provided_ ,  _that_   Parent  shall not be required to obtain the
Financing, giving effect to the portion  obtained from alternative sources,
(i) on terms, which are, taken as a  whole, materially less advantageous to
Parent or (ii) on economic terms less  advantageous to Parent in any event,
in each case, than those of the Financing  contemplated by the Financing
Commitments (taking into account any market flex  provisions thereof).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their 
representatives to, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement 
of  the Financing as may be requested by Parent (provided that such
requested  cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of  the  Company and its Subsidiaries). Such cooperation by the
Company shall include,  at  the reasonable request of Parent and if
reasonably necessary to obtain the  Financing or obtain any portion thereof
from alternative sources pursuant to  subsection (a) above, (i) agreeing to
enter into such agreements, and to use  reasonable best efforts to deliver
such officer\'s certificates and opinions,  as  are customary in financings
of such type and as are, in the good faith  determination of the persons
executing such officer\'s certificates or opinions,  accurate, and agreeing
to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise  grant liens on, the
Company\'s assets pursuant to such agreements as may be  reasonably requested
(provided that no obligation of the Company under any  such  agreement,
pledge or grant shall be effective until the Effective Time), (ii) 
participating in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions,
management  presentation sessions, "road  shows"  and  sessions with
rating agencies, (iii) using commercially reasonable efforts  to  prepare or
participate in the preparation of business projections and financial 
statements for inclusion in offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, 
prospectuses and similar documents, (iv) instructing its independent
accountants  to provide reasonable assistance to Parent (including to provide
consent to  Parent to prepare and use their audit reports relating to the
Company and any  necessary "comfort  letters"  in  connection with the
Financing) and (v) providing to the lenders specified in  the  Financing
Commitments financial and other information in the Company\'s  possession
with respect to the Merger, making the Company\'s senior officers  available
to assist the lenders specified in the Financing Commitments and  otherwise
reasonably cooperating in connection with the consummation of the  Financing;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any  commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other cost or expense that is  not  simultaneously reimbursed by
Parent in connection with the Financing prior  to  the Effective Time.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company,  reimburse the Company
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs  incurred by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such  cooperation and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries  and their
respective representatives for and against any and all losses suffered  or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing 
and  any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information  provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries).

necessary in accordance with Tennessee Law  and  the Company Governing
Documents to call, hold, convene and complete a meeting  of  its

retained by the Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries) not to (and shall not
authorize or permit any of them to),  directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, encourage, facilitate or  induce any inquiry with respect to, or
the making, submission or announcement  of, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions  or  negotiations regarding, or

extent specifically permitted pursuant  to Sections 6.3(c)  or 6.3(d). 
The  Company and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated  any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations
(including, without  limitation, any such activities, discussions or
negotiations conducted by  affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives  (including any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or  other representative) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) with any third  parties conducted heretofore with respect to
consideration of any Acquisition  Proposal. The Company will, within two (2)
days after the date hereof, exercise  any rights under any confidentiality or
non-disclosure agreements with any  such  third parties to require the
return or destruction of non-public information  provided by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their agents and representatives  to  any such third
parties.

 

 

(b) _Notification  of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_.   As promptly as
practicable after receipt of any (x) Acquisition Proposal,  (y) request for
nonpublic information or (z) inquiry (A) that could reasonably  be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) from any Person seeking  to  have
discussions or negotiations with the Company relating to a possible 
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with notice of such 
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including: (i) the material terms 
and  conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry; (ii) the
identity  of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry;  and (iii) a copy of all written materials and a written

The Company shall provide Parent  with 48 hours prior notice (or such lesser

directors) of any meeting of the Company\'s  board of directors at which the
Company\'s board of directors could reasonably  be  expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal or any such inquiry or to consider  providing nonpublic
information to any Person. The Company shall notify Parent,  in writing, of
any decision of the Company\'s board of directors as to whether  to 
consider such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry or to enter into 
discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to
provide  nonpublic information or data to any Person, which notice shall be
given as  promptly as practicable after such meeting. The Company agrees that
it shall  promptly provide Parent with oral and written notice setting forth
all such  information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent currently
informed in  all  material respects of the status and material terms of any
such Acquisition  Proposal, request or inquiry (including any negotiations
contemplated by Section  6.3(c))  and  shall promptly provide Parent a copy
of all written materials and a written  summary of all oral information
subsequently provided to, by or on behalf of  such Person or group in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request  or  inquiry.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Superior  Offers_.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Section 6.3(a),  in the  event that the Company receives prior to the
approval of this Agreement by  the  shareholders of the Company in
accordance with applicable Law an unsolicited,  bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal from a third party that did not result  from a breach of this
Section 6.3  and that  the Company\'s board of directors has in good faith
concluded, after consultation  with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that such Acquisition  Proposal is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Offer, the Company  may then (1) furnish
nonpublic information to the third party making such  Acquisition Proposal
and (2) engage in negotiations with the third party with  respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; provided that:

 

 

(i) the  Company complies with all of the terms of this Section 6.3;

 

 

(ii) prior  to  furnishing any nonpublic information or entering into any
negotiations or  discussions with such third party, (1) the Company receives
from such third  party an executed confidentiality and standstill agreement
containing customary  limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic
written and oral  information furnished to such third party on the Company\'s
behalf in  substantially the form of the Confidentiality Agreement and, in
any event,  no  less restrictive to such third party than the
Confidentiality Agreement is  with  respect to Parent, and (2)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such  nonpublic information to such
third party, the Company furnishes such nonpublic  information to Parent (to
the extent such nonpublic information has not been  previously so furnished);
and

 

 

(iii) the  board  of directors of the Company reasonably determines in good
faith, after  consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
provide such  information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would
result in a  breach of the board of directors\' fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the  Company under applicable Law.

 

 

(d) _Change  of Recommendation_.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 6.3(a),  (x) the  board of directors of the Company may
withhold, withdraw, amend or modify its  Recommendation, and, in the case of
a Superior Offer that is a tender or  exchange offer made directly to the
shareholders of the Company, may recommend  that the shareholders of the
Company accept the tender or exchange offer (any  of  the foregoing actions,
whether by the board of directors of the Company or  a  committee thereof, a
"Change  of  Recommendation"),  (y)  the board of directors of the
Company, the Company or its Subsidiaries  (including each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents  or  other representatives) may
approve, endorse, or recommend a Superior Offer,  and  (z) the Company may,
after payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section  8.3(b), terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and the Company  or  any of its
Subsidiaries may concurrently with such termination execute or enter  into a
binding definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Offer, if and  only
if, prior to any such action described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) hereof, 
all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (vi) are  met:

 

 

(i) the  board  of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with  the Company\'s financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that it may be  required by its fiduciary duties to do so;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) the  shareholders of the Company have not approved this Agreement in
accordance  with  applicable Law;

 

 

(iii) the  Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice (a "Change 
of  Recommendation Notice")  at  least five (5) Business Days prior to
publicly effecting such Change of  Recommendation which shall state expressly
(A), if applicable, that the Company  has received a Superior Offer, the
final terms and conditions of the Superior  Offer and the identity of the
Person or group making the Superior Offer, (B)  that the Company intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation and (C) if  applicable, that the Company
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 8.1(h);

 

 

(iv) after  delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall
(A) provide  Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in
the terms  and  conditions of this Agreement during such five (5) Business
Day period and (B)  negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such
five (5) Business  Day  period, in each case as would enable the Company to
proceed with the  Recommendation without making a Change of Recommendation;

 

 

(v) the  board  of directors of the Company shall have determined after
considering the terms  of  the Merger (as they may be adjusted pursuant to
paragraph (iv) above), after  consultation with the Company\'s financial
advisor and outside legal counsel,  that it is required by its fiduciary
duties to do so; and

 

 

(vi) the  Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
Section  6.2  or this  Section 6.3.

 

 

(e) _Compliance  with Disclosure Obligations_.   Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its board  of  directors from
complying with Rules 14a-9 (False or Misleading Statements),  14d-9
(Recommendation or Solicitation by the Subject Company and Others) and 
14e-2(a) (Position of Subject Company) promulgated under the Exchange Act; 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the content of any such disclosure
thereunder shall be governed by the terms  of  this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall not effect  a  Change of
Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to the terms  of 
Section 6.3(d).

 

 

(f) _State  Takeover Statutes and Company Rights Plan_.   The board of
directors of the Company shall not, in connection with any Change  of
Recommendation, take any action to change the approval of the board of 
directors of the Company for purposes of causing any state takeover statute 
or  other state Law to be applicable to or triggered by the transactions 
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6.3(f)  shall 
not prohibit the Company from effecting a Change of Recommendation under the 
circumstances and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 6.3.

 

 

(g) _Continuing  Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Shareholders\' Meeting;
No Other  Vote_.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the  obligation of the Company to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the  Shareholders\' Meeting shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by (A) the  commencement, disclosure, announcement or
submission to it of any Acquisition  Proposal or (B) any Change of
Recommendation. The Company shall not submit  to  the vote of its
shareholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose to do so,  at  any time
prior to sixty (60) days after the Shareholder\'s Meeting.

 

 

(h) _Certain  Definitions_.   For purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following  meanings:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) "Acquisition  Proposal,"  with  respect to the Company, shall mean any
offer or proposal relating to any  transaction or series of related
transactions involving: (a) any purchase from  any party or acquisition by
any Person or "group"  (as  defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations  thereunder), including the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, of more than  a  ten percent (10%) interest in the total
outstanding voting securities of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any tender offer or exchange offer that  if  consummated would result in any
Person or group beneficially owning ten percent  (10%) or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries,
(b) any merger, consolidation, business combination or  similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) any  sale, lease (other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with  past  practice),
exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of  business
consistent with past practice), acquisition or disposition of more  than 
ten percent (10%) of the assets of the Company (including its Subsidiaries 
taken  as a whole), (d) any recapitalization, reclassification, share
repurchase,  restructuring or similar transaction by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries  that if consummated would increase the percentage interest
of the total  outstanding voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  beneficially owned by any Person or group or (e) any
liquidation or dissolution  of the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that  the transactions between Parent and the Company contemplated by this
Agreement  shall not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal); and

 

 

(ii) "Superior  Offer,"  with  respect to the Company, shall mean an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal by a third party to
acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a  tender offer, exchange offer,
merger, consolidation or other business  combination, all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company and its  Subsidiaries or all of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company as  a  result of which the
shareholders of the Company immediately preceding such  transaction would
hold less than forty percent (40%) of the equity interests  in  the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction and any direct or indirect 
parent or subsidiary thereof, on terms that the board of directors of the 
Company has in good faith concluded, after consultation with its current 
financial advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized 
reputation, taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, 
regulatory and other aspects of the offer (including any terms thereof
relating  to break-up fees, expense reimbursement and conditions to
consummation) and  the  Person making the offer, to be more favorable, from
a financial point of view,  to the Company\'s shareholders (in their
capacities as shareholders) than the  terms of the Merger (which shall
require that such Acquisition Proposal must  provide to the Company\'s
shareholders (in their capacities as shareholders)  consideration with a
value per share of Company Common Stock that is greater  than the Merger
Consideration) and is reasonably capable of being consummated  on  the terms
so proposed prior to the End Date and for which financing, to the  extent
required, is then fully committed or reasonably determined by the board  of
directors of the Company to be available.

 

 

(i) _Specific  Performance_.   The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that  the provisions of this Section 6.3 
were not  performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached.  It  is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that Parent shall
be entitled to  an  immediate injunction or injunctions, without the
necessity of proving the  inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without
the necessity of posting  any  bond or other security, to prevent breaches
of the provisions of this Section  6.3  and to  enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United  States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other  remedy to which
Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting  the 
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth 
above by any officer, director, employee, agent, representative or affiliate 
of  the Company, acting within the scope of his or her employment, or in his
or  her  capacity as an officer, director or shareholder, or otherwise at
the direction  of and on behalf of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Agreement  by the Company.

and its Subsidiaries during the period  prior  to the Effective Time to
obtain all information concerning the business of  the  Company and its
Subsidiaries, including the status of product development  efforts,
properties, results of operations and personnel of the Company and  its 
Subsidiaries and use all reasonable efforts to make available at all
reasonable  times during normal business hours to Parent and its
representatives, the  appropriate individuals (including management,
personnel, attorneys, accountants  and other professionals) for discussion of
the Company and its Subsidiaries\'  business, properties, prospects and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request.  During such period, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to),  subject to any limitations

document filed or received by it during such period pursuant  to the

obtained from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the access 
contemplated by this Section 6.4  shall be  subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

 

(c) _No  Modification of Representations and Warranties or Covenants_.   No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification 
pursuant to this Section 6.4,  Section 6.6,  Section 6.7  or  otherwise
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty  contained
herein, the covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the  conditions
to the obligations of the parties hereto under this  Agreement.

 

 

6.5 _Public  Disclosure_.   Without limiting any other provision of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company  will consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the  opportunity to review and comment upon
and use all reasonable efforts to agree  on any press release or public
statement with respect to this Agreement and  the  transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and will not issue  any  such press release or
make any such public statement prior to such consultation  and (to the extent

requirement of the Nasdaq Global Select Market or any other applicable 
national or regional securities exchange, market or securities quotation

Section 6.2  and  Section 6.3  hereof  and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein, each of  the  parties agrees to use all
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,  all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with  the other parties

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including  the 
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions 
precedent set forth in Article VII to be satisfied; (ii) the obtaining of
all  necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders
and  authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary  registrations, declarations, submissions and filings (including
registrations,  declarations, and filings with Governmental Entities, if any)
and the taking  of  all steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim,
action, investigation  or  proceeding by any Governmental Entity; (iii) the
filing of Notification and  Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ as and in
such form as required by the  HSR  Act; (iv) filings under any other
comparable pre-merger notification forms  reasonably determined by Parent to
be required by the merger notification or  control Laws of any applicable
jurisdiction; (v) the filing of the necessary  applications and notices to

Financing Departments in the states in which the Company or  its 
Subsidiaries are domiciled or where the conduct of their business requires 
the  approval by such departments of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(vi)  any  filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable  state or securities or "blue  sky"  Laws and  the securities
Laws of any foreign country, or any other Law relating to the  Merger; (vii)

applicable Laws. Parent,  Merger Sub and the Company each shall promptly
supply the other with any  information that may be required in order to
effectuate any filings or  application pursuant to this Section 6.6(a).
Without limiting the foregoing,  the  Company and its board of directors
shall, if any takeover statute or similar  Law  is or becomes applicable to
the Merger, this Agreement or any of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to  ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement  may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by  this  Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger, this  Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall this Section 6.6(a) require  Parent or its Subsidiaries

 

 

(i) to  (A)  take any action that would be reasonably expected to adversely

Company pursuant to the Company  Governing Documents and the indemnification
agreements between the Company  and  its directors and officers in effect as
of the date hereof and listed in Section  6.10(a)  of the  Company
Disclosure Schedule (including, to the extent indemnifiable thereunder,  for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this 
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) (the 
"Indemnified  Parties"),  subject to applicable Law. The charter and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation  will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and the  advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable to the Indemnified  Parties as those contained in the
Company Governing Documents as in effect  on  the date hereof, which
provisions will not, except as required by Law, be  amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from  the  Effective Time
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder  of
Indemnified Parties.

 

 

(b) _Insurance_.   For  a  period of six (6) years after the Effective

and officers\' liability insurance  with one or more reputable unaffiliated
third-party insurers covering those  persons who are covered by the
Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability  insurance policy as of the
date hereof for events occurring prior to the  Effective Time on terms and
conditions that are, in the aggregate, no less  favorable to the insured than
those applicable to the current directors and  officers of the Company under
policies maintained by the Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  no
event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one (1) 
year in excess of two hundred twenty-five percent (225%) of the annual
premium  currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the extent
annual  premium would exceed two hundred twenty-five percent (225%) of the
annual  premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage, the
Surviving  Corporation shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be
maintained the  maximum amount of coverage as is available for such two
hundred twenty-five  percent (225%) of such annual premium); and _provided_

Company\'s directors\' and  officers\' insurance policy in effect as of the
date hereof for actions and  omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective

for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each of the  Indemnified

successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or 
its  successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person  and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such  consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its  properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper

in this Section 6.10.

 

 

6.11 _Company  Options_.

(a) Each  Company Option other than any Assumed Option, whether vested or
unvested, that  is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of the  Effective Time, be cancelled at the Effective Time in exchange for
the right  to  receive an amount in cash in U.S. dollars, equal to (x) the
total number of  shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option multiplied by  (y)  the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger
Consideration over the per  share  exercise price of the Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option,  with  the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded down to the nearest cent (the  aggregate amount of such cash
hereinafter referred to as the "Option  Consideration")  less  such amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted in accordance with  Section
2.2(e).

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the terms of Section 6.11(a) above, each Company Option
that (i) is held by  a  Person listed on 6.11(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule (each such Person,  a  "Continuing Investor"), (ii) is outstanding
and unexercised as of the Effective  Time, and (iii) has a per share exercise
price greater than two dollars and  seventy-one cents ($2.71) (each, an
"Assumed Option") shall not be treated  pursuant to the terms of Section
6.11(a) but instead, effective as of the  Effective Time, each Assumed
Option, whether vested or unvested, shall, as  of  the Effective Time, be
cancelled at the Effective Time shall cease to represent  a right to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock at that time, and in exchange  therefor, shall
be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares  of  Parent
Common Stock; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  (x) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise  of  such Assumed Option
shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common  Stock that were
purchasable under such Assumed Option immediately prior to  the  Effective
Time multiplied by the "Exchange Ratio" as defined below, rounded  down  to
the nearest whole share, and (y) the per share exercise price of such
Assumed  Option shall be adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price of
such  Assumed Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounding up to the nearest whole
cent  and  (z) except as provided in this Section 6.11(b), and with respect
only to the  vesting terms and conditions (which shall not be accelerated as
a result of  the  Merger) and the terms of the Assumed Options, the Assumed
Options shall be  on  the same terms and conditions, regarding those matters
as set forth in the  respective grant instruments evidencing the Assumed
Options. For the avoidance  of doubt, in no event will any Company Option
assumed pursuant to this Section  6.11(b) be exchanged for Option
Consideration pursuant to Section 6.11(a) and  Company Options covered under
Section 6.11(a) will not be assumed pursuant  to  this Section 6.11(b). For
purposes of this Section 6.11(b), the "Exchange Ratio"  shall be equal to
0.02125

 

 

(c) The  board  of directors of the Company or the compensation committee
thereof, to the extent  duly authorized, shall make such adjustments and
amendments to or make such  determinations with respect to the Company
Options as may be necessary or  appropriate to implement the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.11. If  and  to the extent necessary or
required by the terms of the Option Plans and any  other plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or pursuant to the terms of any  Company Option
granted thereunder, the Company shall use its reasonable best  efforts to
obtain the necessary consents to implement the foregoing provisions  of this
Section 6.11. The board of directors of the Company or the compensation 
committee thereof, to the extent duly authorized, shall take all actions 
necessary or appropriate to terminate, as of the Effective Time, the Option 
Plans and any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement under which 
equity-based rights of the Company have been granted.

 

 

(d) _Notices_.  With  respect to matters described in this Section 6.11, 
the  Company will use all reasonable efforts to consult with Parent (and
consider  in  good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices
or other  communication materials to its employees.

 

 

6.12 _Section  16 Matters_.   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be  required or appropriate (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause  any dispositions of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with  respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated  by  Article I of this
Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting  requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company  to  be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

shall  have amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent the
Recommendation;  (ii)  it shall have failed to include in the Proxy
Statement the Recommendation;  (iii)  its board of directors fails to

exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement disclosing
that  the board of directors of the Company recommends rejection of such
tender or  exchange offer; (vi) the Company breaches any of its obligations
set forth  in  Sections 6.2  or 6.3;  or  (vii) the board of directors

this Agreement under Section 8.1  above  will be effective immediately upon
the delivery of a valid written notice of  the  terminating party to the
other party hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  nothing in this

at a time inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 8.1(f)  and 8.1(g) 
above.  In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 8.1,  this  Agreement shall be of no further force or effect,

Section 8.3  and  Article IX, each of which shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and  (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from

8.3 _Fees  and Expenses_. 

 

 

(a) _General_.   Except as set forth in this Section 8.3,  all  fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the  transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such  expenses
whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
Parent and the Company shall share equally the fees in connection with the 
filing the Notification and Report Forms filed with the FTC and DOJ under
the  HSR Act, and all premerger notification and reports forms under
similar  applicable Laws of other jurisdictions, in each case pursuant to
Section 6.6;  and _provided_ ,  _further_ ,  that  the Company shall
promptly reimburse all such fees and expenses of Parent if  the  Merger is
consummated.

 

 

(b) _Company  Payment_.

 

 

(i) _Payment_.   The Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days  after the date of termination pursuant to the sections of
this Agreement as  set  forth below, pay Parent a fee equal to thirteen
million dollars ($13,000,000)  in  immediately available funds (the
"Termination  Fee")  in the  event that this Agreement is (i) terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)  or  Section 8.1(g),  _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  in the  case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(g), 
that  the breach by the Company giving rise to termination is willful or
intentional,  (ii) terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(h), 
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  in the  case of termination under Section
8.1(h),  payment  of the Termination Fee by the Company shall be made prior
to such termination,  or (iii) terminated by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, pursuant to Section  8.1(b)  or  Section 8.1(d);  _provided_
,  _further_ ,  that in  the case of termination pursuant to Section
8.1(b),  Section 8.1(d)  or  Section 8.1(g),  (a)  such payment shall be
made only if after the date of this Agreement in respect  of a new
Acquisition Proposal or a restatement of a previously submitted  Acquisition
Proposal that was previously withdrawn or not accepted and prior  to  the
termination of this Agreement in respect of any Acquisition Proposal, there 
has been disclosure publicly or to any member of the board of directors or 
any  officer of the Company of an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company  and within twelve (12) months following the termination of this
Agreement,  an  Acquisition of the Company is consummated or the Company
enters into a  definitive agreement or letter of intent with respect to an
Acquisition of  the  Company and (b) such payment shall be made promptly,
but in no event later  than  two (2) Business Days after the consummation of
such Acquisition of the Company  or the entry into such definitive agreement

(ii) _Interest  and Costs; Other Remedies_.   The Company acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 8.3(b)  are an  integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,  without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.  Accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due  pursuant to this
Section 8.3(b)  and, in  order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim
that results in a judgment  against the Company for the amounts set forth in
this Section 8.3(b),  the  Company shall pay to Parent the reasonable costs
and expenses of Parent  (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
in connection with such  suit, together with interest on the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 8.3(b)  at the  highest prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on any date from the date such  payment was required to be
made until the date on which such payment is actually  made. Payment of the
fees described in this Section 8.3(b)  shall  not be in lieu of damages
incurred in the event of breach of this  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) _Certain  Definitions_.   For the purposes of this Section 8.3(b)

the following transactions (other  than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement): (i) a merger,  consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution  or similar transaction involving

interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such  transaction or any

of a  tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the party or such
Person or  group), directly or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right
to acquire  beneficial ownership of shares representing in excess of forty
percent (40%)  of  the voting power of the then outstanding shares of
capital stock of the  party.

 

 

(c) _Parent  Payment_.

 

 

(i) If  (A)  this Agreement is terminated  by the  Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and at such time all conditions  to  Parent\'s
and the Merger Sub\'s obligations to consummate the Merger shall have  been
satisfied, other than Section 7.2(f); or (B) this Agreement is terminated  by
the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(f)  because  of material breach by
Parent of its obligations under Section 5.2(a),  _provided_ ,  that in  the
case of both of clauses (A) and (B) the Company shall not be in material 
breach of this Agreement, then Parent shall pay to the Company thirteen
million  dollars ($13,000,000) in cash (the "Parent  Termination Fee"), 
it  being understood that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the
fee  referred to in this Section 8.3(c) on more than one occasion, and
_provided_ ,  _further_   that the  provisions of this Section 8.3(c)(i)
shall be subject to Section 8.3(c)(ii)  hereof. If the Parent Termination Fee
shall be payable hereunder, it shall  be  due within two (2) Business Days
after the termination of this Agreement. Any  such payment shall be reduced
by any amounts as may be required to be deducted  or withheld therefrom under
applicable Tax Law.

 

 

(ii) Other  than for fraud in the inducement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have  any  liability to the Company in excess of an aggregate amount
of thirteen million  dollars ($13,000,000) (the "Parent  Liability Cap") 
in  respect of (i) any claims for monetary damages that the Company may
bring  against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement,  (ii) all other such amounts paid by Parent or Merger Sub to the
Company with  respect to all claims that had previously been brought by the
Company against  Parent and/or Merger Sub and (iii) any amounts paid by
Parent to the Company  pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(i). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary,  if any payment to the Company of any
judgment for monetary damages, when taken  together with any amounts paid
pursuant to Section 8.3(c)(i) hereof would cause  the Parent Liability Cap to
be exceeded, such judgment shall be paid only to  the  maximum extent as
would not cause the Parent Liability Cap to be  exceeded.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.4 _Amendment_.   Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended
by the parties hereto,  by action taken or authorized by their respective
boards of directors, at any  time before or after approval of this Agreement
by the shareholders of the  Company; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no 
amendment shall be made which by Law requires further approval by the 
shareholders of the Company without such further shareholder approval. This 
Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing 
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

 

 

8.5 _Extension;  Waiver_.   At any time prior to the Effective Time either
party hereto, by action taken  or  authorized by their respective board of
directors, may, to the extent legally  allowed: (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations  or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in  the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in  any  document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the  agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any  agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall  be  valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such  party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement, including pursuant  to  Section
8.1(b),  shall  not constitute a waiver of such right.

shall be to  a  section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. For
purposes of this  Agreement, the words "include," "includes" 
and "including,"  when  used herein, shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without  limitation."  The  table of contents and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference  purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation  of  this
Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the  business of"  an  entity,
such reference shall be deemed to include the business of such entity  and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.  For the  purposes of this Agreement,
the phrases "has delivered", "has provided" and  similar phrases include
providing Parent access to any required documents and  information through
any website, database or other electronic medium  specifically established
for the purpose of providing Parent access to such  documents and
information.

either Parent or the Company means (i) with respect to Parent, the  actual
knowledge, after reasonable inquiry, of its executive officers and  directors
and (ii) with respect to the Company, the actual knowledge of the  persons
identified in the Company Disclosure Schedule as having knowledge 
attributable to the Company, and the actual knowledge, after reasonable
inquiry,  of the appropriate officers and employees of the Company;
_provided_   that to  the extent that any such appropriate officer or

knowledge attributable to the Company,  "Knowledge"  in  respect of such

(c) For  purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect," when
used in  connection with an entity, means any change, event, violation,

materially adverse to the business, assets  (including intangible assets),
liabilities, capitalization, financial condition,  or results of operations
of such entity taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries,  other than any Effect
or Effects primarily resulting from (A) changes affecting  the United States
or world economy generally, which changes do not  disproportionately affect
such entity (taken as a whole with its Subsidiaries,  if any), (B) the
announcement of the execution of the Agreement, the  transactions
contemplated hereby or the pendency or consummation of the Merger,  (C)
compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by,  this
Agreement or consented to by a party, (D) changes in GAAP or SAP,  (E) any
failure to meet published projections, forecasts or revenue or  earning
predictions for any period (provided that the underlying causes of  such 
failure shall be considered in determining whether there is a Material
Adverse  Effect) or (F) any shareholder litigation arising from allegations
of a  breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement or (ii) materially
impedes  or could reasonably be expected to materially impede the authority
of such  entity, or, in any case, the Company, to consummate the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof and  applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement,  each of Parent and the Company agrees that for purposes of the
definition of  "Material Adverse Effect," each material adverse development
in any of the  Litigation Matters against the Company, including, without
limitation, (i)  with  respect to the insurance coverage available to the
Company therefor, (ii) the  discovery of facts adverse to the Company through
legal process, internal  investigation or otherwise or (iii) the assertion of

Schedule may be cross  referenced to any other section or sections of the
Company Disclosure Schedule  provided that any such cross reference is
express and specific. The fact that  any information is disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be  construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this  Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, the information set forth in the  Company Disclosure Schedule,
and the dollar thresholds set forth in this  Agreement, shall not be used as
a basis for interpreting the terms "material"  or  "Material Adverse Effect"
or other similar terms in this Agreement.

 

 

9.4 _Counterparts_.   This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by facsimile,  all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become  effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties  and delivered to the other parties, it
being understood that all parties need  not sign the same counterpart.

 

 

  9.5 _Entire  Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.   This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among  the  parties
hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company 
Disclosure Schedule and the Voting Agreement, Employment and Non-Competition 
Agreements, Subscription Agreements, Management Stockholders\' Agreement and 
any Resignation  and Restrictive Covenants Agreement  (i)  constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject  matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both  written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,  including
the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, it being understood that the 
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the 
Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not 
intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, 
except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in
Section 6.10.  Without  limiting the foregoing, it is expressly understood
and agreed that the  provisions in Section 6.9  are  statements of current
intent and no Employees/Service Providers or other Person  (including any
party hereto) shall have any rights or remedies, including rights  of
enforcement, with respect thereto and no Employee/Service Provider or other 
Person is or is intended to be a third-party beneficiary thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.6 _Severability_.   In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof,  becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal,  void  or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force  and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or  circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of  the  parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable  provision of this Agreement with
a valid and enforceable provision that will  achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other  purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

 

 

9.7 _Other  Remedies_.   Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly  conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of  any  other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the  exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any  other remedy.

 

 

9.8 _Governing  Law_.   This Agreement, including the validity hereof and
the rights and obligations  of  the parties hereunder, shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by  the  Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts made and to be performed  entirely in such State
(without giving effect to the conflicts of laws  provisions thereof);
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the Merger shall be governed by Tennessee
Law. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and  the Company hereto agrees that any
action or proceeding brought to enforce  the  rights or obligations of any
party hereto under this Agreement will be commenced  and maintained in any
court of competent jurisdiction located in the State  of  Delaware and
hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such tribunal.  Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that process may  be 
served upon it by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed as 
provided in Section 9.2,  and  consents to the exercise of jurisdiction of
the courts of the State of Delaware  over it and its properties with respect
to any action, suit or proceeding  arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby or the enforcement of any
rights under this Agreement. 

 

 

9.9 _Rules  of Construction_.   The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during  the  negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the  application of any Law providing that
ambiguities in an agreement or other  document will be construed against the
party drafting such agreement or  document.

 

 

9.10 _Assignment_.   No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests,  or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other  parties, except that Parent may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations  hereunder to any of its Subsidiaries as long as
Parent remains ultimately liable  for all of Parent\'s obligations hereunder.
Any purported assignment in violation  of this Section 9.10  shall be 
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon  and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective  successors and permitted assigns.

 

 

9.11 _Waiver  of Jury Trial_.   EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT  TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON  CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR  THE  ACTIONS OF PARENT,
MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,  PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
