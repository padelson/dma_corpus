liability company (" _DPP_ "), Davison Transport, Inc., a Louisiana
corporation (" _Davison Transport_ "), Transport Company, an Arkansas
corporation (" _TransportCo_ "), Davison Terminal Service, Inc., a Louisiana
corporation (" _Terminal_ "), Sunshine Oil and Storage, Inc., a Louisiana
corporation (" _Sunshine_ "), TandT Chemical, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ("

Masters_ "), TDC, L.L.C., a Louisiana limited liability company (" _TDC_ "),
and Red River Terminal, L.L.C., a Louisiana limited liability company (" _Red
River_ ") (except as otherwise provided herein, each a " _Seller_ ", and
collectively, the " _Sellers_ ").

_INTRODUCTION_

1\. The Sellers have developed a substantial private business that operates
primarily in the refinery services, terminaling, trucking and
transportation and marketing sectors;

2\. The Buyer has developed a substantial public business that operates
primarily in the crude oil transportation, gathering and marketing sector and
industrial gases sector;

3\. The Sellers and the Buyer believe their respective businesses
are complementary and the value of such businesses could be enhanced by
combining and continuing to grow them under a single public company;

4\. To achieve such a combination and the related benefits, the Buyer desires
to acquire, and each Seller desires to contribute and sell (or cause to be
contributed and sold) to the Buyer, the Sellers private businesses
described herein for a specified amount of cash and equity interest in the
Buyer, as specified herein.

_AGREEMENT_

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties
and covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1\. _Definitions_.

" _Acquired Assets_ " means those DPP Assets, the Davison Transport Assets,
the TransportCo Assets, the Terminal Assets, the Sunshine Assets and the TandT
Assets that constitute Subject Assets, including the Acquired Equity
Interests.

" _Acquired Assets Assignment_ " means the Assignment Agreement in a form to
be mutually agreed by the Buyer and Sellers to be entered into at the Closing.

" _Acquired Companies_ " means Fuel Masters, TDC and Red River, and "
_Acquired Company_ " means one of the Acquired Companies.



 

1 " _Acquired Company Employees_ " means employees of the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing Date.

" _Acquired Equity Interests_ " means all of the outstanding equity interests
in the Acquired Companies. 

" _Adjusted Working Capital_ " means, with respect to the Subject Assets, the
positive or negative amount derived by subtracting (without duplication) (i)
the Assumed Obligations constituting trade payables and current liabilities
from (ii) the Subject Assets constituting current assets (excluding from
current assets in clause (ii) Product Inventory); _provided, however,_ that
the term "Adjusted Working Capital" shall not include (without duplication)
the value of any (a) current assets or liabilities relating to Taxes
(including any deferred Tax assets or liabilities), (b) current assets or
liabilities relating to purchase accounting reserves, (c) Obligations
otherwise included in Adjusted Working Capital and for which this Agreement
allocates the ultimate economic costs or benefits to the Sellers (e.g.,
specified Straddle Period Taxes), (d) any current assets, trade payables,
current liabilities or Obligations owed to or from any Company or any
Affiliate thereof (including the Acquired Companies), and (e) any
Retained Assets (including those Retained pursuant to any dividend,
assignment or otherwise permitted by _Section 5(o)_) or Retained Obligations.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that no Party
should be unjustly enriched or injured as a result of giving effect to a
particular economic consequence more than once under this Agreement by way of
inclusion in more than one of the terms Adjusted Working Capital (as of the
Valuation Time), Purchase Price Increases or Purchase Price Decreases. By way
of example, an item that is (or is deemed to be) included in the calculation
Adjusted Working Capital as of the Valuation Time should not also be included
as a separate component of either of the Purchase Price Increases or Purchase
Price Decreases, because such item would already decrease or increase, as
applicable, the Purchase Price due to its inclusion in Adjusted Working
Capital.

" _Adverse Consequences_ " means all actions, suits, proceedings, hearings,
investigations, charges, complaints, claims, demands, injunctions, judgments,
orders, decrees, rulings, damages, dues, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid
in settlement, Obligations, Taxes, liens, losses (including any diminution in
value), expenses, and fees, including court costs and attorneys fees and
expenses, but excluding (except as provided in _Section 9_) punitive
exemplary, special, indirect and consequential damages.

" _Affiliate_ " means a Person that directly, or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the Person specified, and in addition, with respect to the Buyer, each
member or stockholder, or Affiliate of either, of Genesis GP. For purposes of
this definition, the term "control" (including its derivatives) means the
ability to direct the management or policies of such Person by ownership of
voting interest, contract or otherwise and shall be construed as such term is
used in the rules promulgated under the Securities Act; _provided, however_
that, after the Closing (x) each Acquired Company will be deemed to be an
Affiliate of the Buyer (not of any Seller), and (y) each Seller and each
Person (other than any Acquired Company) who was an Affiliate of any Seller
immediately before the Closing will be deemed not to be an Affiliate of
the Buyer, and vice versa.



 

2 " _Agreement_ " means this Contribution and Sale Agreement (including all

Subject Contracts existing on the date hereof or entered into after the date

provided to the Buyer as provided by this Agreement, in each case to the
extent such Obligations (i) relate to, arise from or are otherwise
attributable to acts or omissions that are not prohibited under this Agreement
and are attributable to facts, circumstances or events (including complete
performance, partial performance or a failure to perform) occurring after the
Valuation Time, (ii) do not arise from a violation of or a penalty or similar

similar consequence under any agreement or Law resulting from any act or

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state
of its organization. Each of the Sellers is duly qualified and in good
standing under the Laws of each other jurisdiction that requires

Effect. Each of the Sellers has full power and authority to carry on the
business in which it is engaged, and to own and use the properties owned and
used by it. The Sellers have delivered to the

generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such

by which such Seller is bound or to which any of its assets are subject,
except where the violation, conflict, breach, default, acceleration,
termination, modification, cancellation, failure to give notice, right to
payment or other compensation or Encumbrance would not (x) delay or materially
affect the ability of any Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
by such Transaction Agreement or (y) result in a Seller Material Adverse
Effect.

financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of an investment in all of the Units. Each Seller is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Each Seller understands that, when issued to such Seller at the Closing, none
of the Units will be registered pursuant to the Securities Act or any

each covered insured;

(iii) the policy number and the period of coverage;



 

39 (iv) the scope (including an indication of whether the coverage was on a
claims made, occurrence, or other basis) and amount (including a description
of how deductibles and ceilings are calculated and operate) of coverage; and

(v) a description of any deductible, retroactive premium adjustments or other
loss-sharing arrangements.

With respect to each Company Insurance Policy:

(A) the policies are enforceable (other than those that have lapsed in
accordance with their terms);

(B) with respect to any policies, if Buyer validly assumes same and
the counter-parties thereto consent to the assignment of same to Buyer on
identical terms as those of Sellers and Buyer makes and all premium payments
due thereunder, such policy will continue to be enforceable on identical terms
following the consummation of the Transaction Agreements subject to
termination in accordance with its terms;

(C) None of the Companies or, to Sellers Knowledge, any Affiliate thereof
(and, to the Sellers Knowledge, no counter-party) is in breach of such
policies (including with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of
notices), and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute a breach under the policies; and

(D) to Sellers knowledge, no party to any Company Insurance Policies has
repudiated any provision thereof.

Other than as described in _Schedule 4(s)_ , since January 1, 2004, none of
the Companies has ever been denied coverage nor, to the Sellers Knowledge,
has any such denial been threatened. _Schedule 4(s)_ also describes any self-
insurance arrangements affecting any Company (excluding deductibles,
retroactive premiums and loss sharing arrangements described in accordance
with clause ( _v_ ) of this _Section 4(s_)).

(t) _Inventory_. Each Companys inventory, whether reflected on the Financial
Statements or not, consists of raw materials and supplies, manufactured and
processed parts, goods-in-process and finished goods, all of which is
merchantable and fit for the purpose for which it was procured or manufactured
and, except as is reflected on the face of the balance sheet as of March 31,
2007 (rather than the notes thereto), none of which is obsolete, damaged, or
defective. Any inventory included in the balance sheet as of March 31, 2007
that has been written down has either been written off or written down to its
expected net realizable value. Except as required by GAAP or as is
not material, individually or in the aggregate, there has been no change in
inventory valuation standard or methods with respect to the inventory in the
prior three years. The quantities of each kind of inventory are reasonable in
the current (and the currently foreseeable) circumstances of the Subject
Business subject to sales of same in the Ordinary Course of Business. No
Company holds any items of inventory on consignment from other Persons and no
other Person holds any items of inventory on consignment from any Company.

(v) _Adjusted Working Capital_. The total Adjusted Working Capital of the
Companies as of the Valuation Time and the Closing (after excluding current

the computation of such estimated Adjusted Working Capital as of March 31,
2007.

(w) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except as and to the extent set

Companies to allow Buyers outside auditing firm to prepare at Buyers

connection with the preparation of financial information referenced in this
_Section 5(b)(ii)_ if the Closing occurs or if the Closing does not occur for
any reason other than termination by Buyer pursuant to _Section 11(a)(ii)_.

Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as contemplated by _Schedule 5(c)_
, cause or permit the Companies to engage in any practice, take any action or
enter into any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of Business. Subject to

Buyer or its representatives copies of all filings they make with any
Governmental Authority during such period. Without limiting the generality of

service, maintain, improve or otherwise enhance the Retained Assets (except
to the extent such use is performed in the Ordinary Course of Business and is
reflected in the Adjusted Working Capital calculation as of the Valuation Time
or

of the Closing Date to be less than zero); or for the benefit of the business
or operations relating to the Retained Companies other than the Subject
Assets; and

(xvii) enter into any contract, agreement or commitment to do any of the
foregoing.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5(c)_,

destruction or condemnation of property resulting in an aggregate Damage
Amount of (i) less than $56,000,000, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
such Damage Amount, the Parties shall be obligated to proceed with
the Closing, and Sellers shall retain (or to the extent received by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates following the Closing, the Buyer or such Affiliate,
shall pay to the Sellers), all property casualty insurance proceeds or
condemnation proceeds relating to such damage, destruction or condemnation,
and (ii) more than $56,000,000, the Buyer shall not be obligated to Close,
_provided_ that, in lieu of electing not to close, the Buyer may elect: either
(y) to offer to extend the date for Closing to allow the Sellers the
opportunity (in the Sellers sole discretion) to repair or replace, or to
cause the repair or replacement of, any such damaged or destroyed assets; or
(z) to accept the Subject Assets, notwithstanding any such destruction,
taking, or pending or threatened taking (without reduction of the Purchase

casualty insurance proceeds actually received in respect of such
damage, destruction or condemnation by the Sellers or any Affiliates that are
not required to be paid by any of them as a reimbursement to any property

committed, used or applied by such Seller or its Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date to repair, restore or replace such damaged or taken assets, and
shall assign and transfer to the Buyer, or subrogate the Buyer to, all of the
right, title and interest of the Sellers and their Affiliates in and to any
such unpaid awards or other payments arising out of the damage, destruction,
condemnation, or pending or threatened condemnation that are
actually received by the Sellers or any of its Affiliates and that are not
required to be paid by any of them as a  



 

46  reimbursement to any property casualty insurance providers of the Sellers
and its Affiliates. If any such payments required by this _Section 5(e)_ to
be paid to the Buyer are not assignable, the Sellers will collect such
payments at the Buyers expense and remit all such amounts, less any related
expenses, to the Buyer as such are collected. Prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall not compromise, settle or adjust any amounts payable to the
Buyer under clause (z) above, without first obtaining the written consent of
the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The

by any Company or an Affiliate thereof, Sellers shall permit, and shall cause

normal business operations of the Companies and their Affiliates, to all
premises, properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax Records),
contracts and documents of or pertaining to each Company and the Subject
Assets. Subject to compliance with applicable Law and
applicable Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements, the Buyer may
undertake a Phase I environmental assessment or assessments of the operations,

not include physical testing without Sellers express prior written consent
(which may be granted or withheld in Sellers sole discretion.

contemplated by this Agreement that may be required under the HSR Act. The

soon as practicable after the execution hereof for filings under the HSR Act.
The Parties shall request early termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act for the HSR Act filing, shall promptly make any appropriate or
necessary subsequent or supplemental filings and shall cooperate in the
preparation of such filings as is reasonably necessary and appropriate. The
Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any antitrust or trade regulatory laws of any
Governmental Authority. The Buyer and the Sellers agree to take all actions
that may be required by the FTC in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable, except agreeing to
sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any business or assets so required
to be sold, held separate or disposed of by the FTC. The Buyer shall pay 100%
of all filing fees in connection with all filings under the HSR Act.

(h) _Title Commitments and Surveys_.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Sellers and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
one or more title companies reasonably acceptable to Buyer (collectively, the
" _Title Company_ "), to furnish Buyer and its counsel a current owners ALTA
title policy commitment (the " _Title Commitment_ ") describing and covering
each  



 

47  fee owned portion of the Subject Real Property (each such property covered
by a Title Commitment, the " _Insured Property_ "), listing Buyer as the
prospective named insured, showing title in the respective Seller, and
committing to issue an Owners ALTA Title Insurance Policy underwritten by a
title insurance company or companies acceptable to Buyer in the amount of the
value of the land and improvements located thereon. The Sellers shall cause
the Title Company to deliver to Buyer clear and legible copies of all
instruments listed or referenced in each Title Commitment as exceptions or
encumbrances to title to each Insured Property (the " _Title Exception
Documents_ ") at the time each Title Commitment is delivered.

(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer, Buyers counsel and the Title Company a
copy of a survey plat prepared, at the Buyers expense, by a
registered public surveyor approved by the Title Company and Buyer,
reflecting the results of a new or updated on the ground survey (the "
_Survey_ ") of each Insured Property. Each Survey shall be in form and
substance acceptable to Buyer and shall be in form and substance acceptable
to the Title Company as a basis for issuing the form of owners title
insurance policy that the Title Company is required to deliver to Buyer at the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, each Survey shall be certified to Buyer and
the Title Company and shall contain such form of ALTA or similar certification
as Buyer and the Title Company may require.

(iii) Buyer and its counsel shall have ten (10) days after the date of receipt
of the last of the Survey and the Title Commitment for each respective Insured
Property (including legible copies of all of the Title Exception Documents)
(the " _Title Objection Period_ ") to notify the Sellers in writing (the "
_Buyer s Title Objection Notice_") of any easements, rights-of-way,
encroachments, conflicts, protrusions, liens, encumbrances, restrictions,
conditions, covenants or other matters affecting the property other than
Permitted Encumbrances (collectively, the " _Exceptions_ ") which are
unacceptable to Buyer in Buyers reasonable discretion (" _Buyer s Title
Objections_"). In the absence of any such notice prior to the expiration of
the applicable Title Objection Period, the applicable Survey and the
applicable Title Commitment shall be deemed to have been approved by Buyer
and the Exceptions revealed thereby shall be Permitted Encumbrances with
respect to such properties.

(iv) The Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to cure Buyers Title
Objections, but shall have no obligation to institute any legal proceedings or
incur expenses in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate.

(v) The Sellers shall be responsible for the first $100,000 of Adverse
Consequences attributable to Buyers Title Objections (less the aggregate
amount, if any expended by Sellers pursuant to _Section 5(h)(iv))_. The Buyer
shall be responsible for all Adverse Consequences attributable to Buyers
Title Objections in excess of the first $100,000 except to the extent Sellers
are required to indemnify Buyer for same as provided in _Section 9(b)(i)._



 

48 (vi) Buyer shall have the option to obtain, at or prior to Closing at
Buyers expense, Owners ALTA Title Insurance Policies (or their equivalent)
(the " _Title Policies_ ") insuring good and infeasible title to any Insured
Property from the applicable Title Company that issued a Title Commitment on
such Insured Property, each of which Title Policies shall be on the prescribed
form of ALTA/TLTA Owner Policy of Title Insurance or any equivalent and which
shall include all applicable deletions of standard exceptions and endorsements
(including an extended coverage endorsement and deletion of the survey
exception except for "shortages in areas" permitted under state Law) which are
customarily required by purchasers purchasing property comparable to the
applicable Insured Property. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that, regardless of whether or not Buyer elects to
obtain any such Title Policies pursuant to a particular Title Commitment, all
such properties that are covered by a Title Commitment shall be deemed to be
Insured Properties.

(i) _Liens and Encumbrances_. Prior to or contemporaneously with the Closing,
Sellers shall obtain releases of Encumbrances disclosed in _Schedule 4(a)(i_
), without any post-Closing liability or expense (or any increase in the
Assumed Obligations) to the Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Subject
Assets or the Subject Business and shall provide proof of such releases and
payment in full in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer at the Closing,
subject to the provisions of _Section 10_.

(j) _Periodic Operating Information_. Sellers shall deliver monthly financial
operating information including a monthly balance sheet, statement of
operations, statement of changes in cash flow, aged Receivables and payables
analysis and inventory analysis attributable to the Business when available,
and Sellers shall prepare same on the Ordinary Course of Business consistent
with past practices.

(k) _Insurance_. Sellers shall cause any insurance policies covering the
Companies, the Subject Assets and the Business to remain in full force and
effect or to be renewed and maintained in full force and effect through (but
not after) the Closing Date; __provided_ , _however__ , that Sellers shall
maintain each Acquired Company or the Subject Assets (as applicable) as
divested entities or assets on such insurance policies and any subsequent
renewal thereof. Sellers shall not take any action to release any insurer with
respect to any claim made under any such insurance policy before the Closing
Date.

(l) _Termination of Associate Contracts_. Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
terminate or cause the termination of each Subject Contract to which any
Acquired Company is a party and any Associate is a counter-party, except such
Subject Contracts as Buyer and the Associate party thereto may agree prior to
the Closing to keep in force and effect after the Closing. Such termination
shall be at no cost or expense (and shall not increase the Assumed
Obligations) to the Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Subject Assets or the
Subject Business. All accounts receivable and accounts payable related
thereto shall be forgiven at the Closing in accordance with _Section 2_ and
Adjusted Working Capital shall be adjusted, if applicable.

(m) _Risk of Loss_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
all risk of loss or damage to the Subject Assets shall be borne by Sellers.



 

49 (n) _Employees_.

shall also set forth for each such employee the years of service with the
Companies and any predecessors that are currently credited for the purpose of

the hiring or the voluntary or involuntary termination of Eligible Employees
or similar circumstances involving Eligible Employees or to maintain the safe
and efficient operation of the assets.

 

(ii) _Offers of Employment_. The Buyer shall (or shall cause an Affiliate to)
offer to hire each Eligible Employee. The Buyer shall extend such offer
within the thirty (30) day period immediately following the date of this
Agreement. Any such offer shall include the following terms: the employment
shall be (v) effective as of the Closing Date, (w) on a full-time basis, if
the relevant Eligible Employee had full-time status as of the Closing Date, or
a part-time basis, if the relevant Eligible Employee had part-time status as

2007 that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to
Eligible Employees immediately prior to Closing, and (z) at a location that

addition, Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) will continue to retain the
Acquired Company Employees on the same terms and conditions of employment made
available to the Eligible Employees pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. The Buyer will give each Eligible Employee to whom an offer of
employment is made no less than seven (7) business days from the date the
offer is made to accept or reject the employment offer. The Buyer shall notify
Sellers of each Eligible Employee that has accepted or rejected the offer of
employment as promptly as possible after such indication, but in no event
later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer will,
and will cause its applicable Affiliates to, evaluate and make hiring
decisions with  



 

50  respect to the Eligible Employees in accordance with applicable Law. Nothing
in this paragraph shall be construed to require the Buyer to provide
post retirement benefits to the Eligible Employees, to any of Sellers
employees not accepting a position with Buyer or its Affiliates, or to any
currently retired former employees of the Sellers.

(iii) _Timing of Transfer_. Each Eligible Employee who accepts Buyers offer
of employment shall become an employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates as
applicable, as of 12:00 a.m. of the respective local time at the location
where such Eligible Employee is employed on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that if any such Eligible Employee is on a leave of absence approved by
a Company or any of its Affiliates on the Closing Date, such employee shall
not become an employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates on that date. Such
employees first day of employment shall be postponed until the first day
immediately following the expiration of such leave, _provided_ such employee
is otherwise able to commence active employment and the Buyers offer of
employment remains in effect at that time. At such time that the Eligible
Employees become employees of the Buyer or its Affiliates, the Buyer and its
Affiliates shall become responsible for payment of all salaries, wages,
severance, accrued and unused vacation, and benefits and all other claims
(including medical, dental, vision, disability and other benefits claimed),
costs, expenses, liabilities and other obligations relating to the employment
of the Continued Employees incurred from and after such time. The Sellers
shall be responsible for all salaries, wages, and benefits and all
other claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and other obligations related to
the employment or termination of the Eligible Employees incurred prior to the
Closing Date. For purposes of medical, dental, vision, disability and other
similar benefits, a claim will be deemed to have been incurred upon the
incurrence of a qualified expense for which reimbursement or payment is
sought.

(iv) _Participation in Plans_. All Continued Employees shall cease active
participation in all plans, programs and arrangements of the Sellers relating
to compensation and employee benefits as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and shall, from and after such time, be permitted
to participate in plans provided by Buyer through December 31, 2007 that are
no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to Eligible Employees
immediately prior to Closing. Commencing January 1, 2008 all Continued
Employees will be permitted to participate in all of Buyers compensation and
employee benefit plans. No liability arising under any Company Plan, program
or benefit with respect to any Eligible Employee is assumed by the Buyer or
any Buyer Plan, and any such liabilities will be the responsibility of the
Sellers. Sellers shall take all action necessary to confirm that effective as
of the Closing, the Acquired Companies will have withdrawn as a
"participating employer" from any such Company Plan, program or benefit and
each such Company Plan, program or benefit shall be deemed terminated with
respect to the Acquired Companies effective at such time and date. 



 

51 (v) _Credit for Service_. To the extent that any Continued Employees become
eligible to participate in any Buyer Plan, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting, service with the Sellers shall be
treated as service under such Buyer Plan other than Buyers bonus program.
Such credited service shall also be recognized for purposes of satisfying any
pre-existing conditions, actively at work exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation by and coverage of the Continued Employees and their
eligible dependents in the Buyer Plans. In addition, with respect to the
Continued Employees, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all Persons administering or underwriting any Buyer Plans that are
group health plans, at no out-of-pocket cost to the Buyer, the Companies or
the Subject Business, to (x) waive any pre-existing conditions, unless such
conditions are excluded under the Sellers or the Buyers group health plan,
and so long as there is not a gap in "creditable coverage" (as defined under
HIPAA) of sixty-three (63) days or more, (y) waive any waiting periods with
respect to the Continued Employees and their eligible dependents, and (z)
waive any actively-at-work exclusions.

(vi) _Termination_.

(A) The Buyer and its Affiliates may retain the services of any Continued
Employee or terminate any such Continued Employees employment at any time. If
the employment of any Continued Employee is terminated by the Buyer or its
Affiliates within one year following the Closing Date (other than for
termination due to violation of generally applicable policies of such
Persons), then the Buyer shall, or shall cause such Affiliate to, provide such
employee with severance pay as set forth on _Schedule 5(n)(vi)_ hereto in
exchange for a release acceptable to the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(B) The Sellers shall retain liability and responsibility for the payment of
severance benefits (if any), incurred prior to the Closing Date as a result of
any Adverse Consequences, including the termination or transfer of employment
of any current or past employee from the Sellers prior to the Closing Date;
provided that, if the employment of any Retained Employee is terminated by the
Companies or their Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement and the Buyer hires such terminated Retained Employee within
one year following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall reimburse the Sellers for
the Prorated Retained Employee Severance Amount applicable to such Retained
Employee.

(vii) _Paid Time Off_. With regard to vacation allowances, Continued Employees
shall continue accruing vacation benefits with Buyer as of the Closing Date
in accordance with Sellers existing pre-Closing plans until December 31,
2007, at which time the Continued Employees will be included in Buyers Plans.
Buyer shall provide, or shall cause the Acquired Companies, if applicable, to
provide, credit for each Continued Employees service with the Companies, and
their respective Affiliates to the same extent as such service was recognized
by  



 

52  each of them immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided that the Buyer
will not with respect to any Continued Employee provide any credit
or compensation for unused vacation days or other paid time off accumulated
with any Company or Affiliate thereof not taken prior to January 1, 2008.

(viii) _WARN Act_. The Buyer will not engage within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date in a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as such terms are defined
in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as amended, or any
similar state law) with respect to the Subject Assets.

(ix) _No Solicitation_. From the date of this Agreement until one year from
and after the Closing Date, the Sellers agree not to (and shall not permit any
of their Affiliates to) solicit, offer employment to or employ any Continued
Employee without the prior written consent of the Buyer; provided that, the
foregoing shall not prohibit general solicitations of employment not
specifically directed toward such employees or the hiring of such employees in
response thereto, nor the hiring, employment or engagement of any such
employee who presents himself or herself for employment without direct or
indirect solicitation by the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers.

(x) _COBRA_. The Buyer shall provide and be solely responsible for any
continuation coverage required under Section 4980 of the Code, Part 6 of
Title I of ERISA or applicable state law (" _COBRA_ ") to each Continued
Employee or any person related to such employee who is a "qualified
beneficiary" as that term is defined in COBRA whose first "qualifying event"
(as defined in COBRA) occurs after the Continued Employee actually commences
participation in the Buyers group medical plan. To the extent required by
Law, the Sellers shall be solely responsible for any COBRA health care
continuation claims of Retained Employees and their qualified beneficiaries.

(xi) _Deductible Reimbursements_. To the extent permitted by Law, within
sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the
Buyer a list of the deductible expenses paid by each Continued Employee under
the Company Plans during the current plan year up to the Closing Date and the
maximum deductible under the Company Plan in which the Continued Employee was
enrolled immediately prior to Closing (the " _Deductible Notice_ "). From and
after the Closing Date through December 31, 2007, the Buyer shall reimburse
each Continued Employee for any and all amounts paid by such Continued
Employee during the current plan year up to December 31, 2007 that exceed the
maximum deductible identified for such employee on the Deductible Notice;
provided, that the Continued Employee provides to the Buyer the explanation of
benefits sent to them by their insurance provider as proof of such payment.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this  _Section 5(n)(xi)_
obligates the Buyer to reimburse a Continued Employee for coinsurance or
maximum out-of-pocket amounts.



 

53 (o) _Transfer Retained Assets, Excess Working Capital Assets, and Assumption
of Retained Obligations Prior to Closing_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers
shall cause the Acquired Companies to transfer (by dividend, assignment or
otherwise, but no such transfer is required to be for consideration paid to
any Acquired Company) the Retained Assets owned by any Acquired Company to
any of the Retained Companies or their stockholder(s) or members, as the case
may be, and shall cause the Sellers or stockholders or members of any Seller
to assume from each Acquired Company the Retained Obligations of such
Acquired Company. In addition, prior to Closing, Sellers may cause any of the
Companies to transfer (by dividend, assignment or otherwise), or at Closing
may retain cash, cash equivalents or receivables in an amount up to the
amount of same that existed as of the Valuation Time; _provided, however_ that
such transfers and retentions (x) are taken into consideration in calculating
the Adjusted Working Capital attributable to the Subject Assets as of
the Valuation Time and the Closing, as applicable, and (y) do not cause
Adjusted Working Capital, as of either date, to be less than zero.

(p) _Limitations_.

(i) _No Reliance_. Buyer covenants that it has reviewed and had access to all
documents, records, and information which it has desired to review in
connection with its decision to enter into this Agreement, and to purchase the
Acquired Companies and the Subject Assets, to assume the Assumed Obligations
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. In deciding to enter
into this Agreement, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
Buyer covenants that it has relied solely upon its own knowledge,
investigation, and analysis (and that of its representatives) and not on any
disclosure or representation made by, or any duty to disclose on the part of,
Sellers, their Affiliates, or any of their representatives, other than the
representations and warranties of Sellers expressly set forth herein and the
other Transaction Agreements.

(ii) _Assets_. Notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in any
other provision of this Agreement, it is the explicit intent of each Party
that Sellers and their Affiliates are not making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, express, implied, at common law, statutory or otherwise,
except for the representations or warranties given in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, and it is understood that Buyer, with such
exceptions, takes the Subject Assets "as is" and "where is." Without limiting
the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, except as provided in
this Agreement, Sellers hereby expressly disclaim and negate any
representation or warranty, express or implied, at common law, statutory, or
otherwise, relating to (i) the condition of the Subject Assets and the
Business related thereto (including any implied or express warranty of
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or of conformity to
models or samples of materials, or the presence or absence of any hazardous
materials in or on, or disposed or discharged from, the Subject Assets) or
(ii) any infringement by the Acquired Companies of any patent or proprietary
right of any third party. Buyer has agreed not to rely on any representation
made by Sellers with respect to the condition, quality, or state of the
Subject Assets, except for those in this Agreement, but rather, as a
significant portion of the consideration  



 

54  given to Sellers for this purchase and sale, has agreed to rely solely and
exclusively upon its own evaluation and the representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements of Sellers in this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements.

(q) _Amendment of Schedules_. Each Party agrees that, with respect to the
representations and warranties of such Party contained in _Sections 3_ , _4_
and _5(m)_ of this Agreement, such Party shall have the continuing obligation
until the Closing to correct, supplement, or amend promptly the Schedules to
such Partys Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter hereafter arising or
discovered which, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules. Any such
correction, supplement, or amendment shall be delivered to the other Party no
later than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. For all purposes
of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 8_ have been fulfilled, the Schedules to a
Partys Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to include only that information
contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to
exclude all information contained in any such correction, supplement, or
amendment thereto.

(r) _AMEX Listing_. Buyer will apply (promptly after the execution of this
Agreement) for listing of the Units on the American Stock Exchange and use its
good faith commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain approval of such
listing as soon as practical.

(s) _Cancellation of Letters of Credit_. The Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to replace, effective on the Closing Date, all of the
letters of credit listed on _Schedule 5(s)_ as security for the performance of
Obligations under any Subject Contract and relating to the Assumed Obligations
and any other letters of credit issued in the Ordinary Course of Business on
behalf of any Company after the date hereof in accordance with _Section 5(c)_
as security for the performance of its Obligations under any Subject Contract
and relating to the Assumed Obligations, with letters of credit in like
amount, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the beneficiaries of
such letters of credit, issued on behalf of Buyer.

(t) _Potential Reorganization Transactions_. Each Party agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to amend and/or restate the refinery services
agreements to which TDC is a party prior to Closing in a manner consistent
with the form that the Parties have previously discussed and which ensures
that income from such agreements constitutes "qualifying income" as such term
is defined in the Code. To the extent any such agreement has not been amended
and/or restated prior to Closing, the Parties agree that upon acquisition of
TDC by Buyer, Buyer may cause TDC to assign such contract to a subsidiary of
the Buyer, which will be taxed as a corporation and Sellers agree that they
will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, in
connection with such assignment.

6\. _Post-Closing Covenants_. The Parties agree as follows:

(a) _General_. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the Parties
shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as the other Party reasonably may request,
all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless
the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section
9_).



 

55 (b) _Retained Obligations_. Contemporaneous with the Closing, the Sellers
shall pay all Indebtedness (other than letters of credit listed on _Schedule
5(s)_ to be replaced by Buyer or provided after the date hereof in the
Ordinary Course of Business and to be replaced by Buyer in connection with the
Closing as provided in  _Section 5(s)_ with a similar instrument provided by
or on behalf of Buyer in accordance with _Section 5(s)_). Sellers agree to
timely pay and satisfy all other Retained Obligations as and when due.

(c) _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any Party actively
is contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or before the Closing Date
involving the Companies or the Subject Assets, the other Party shall cooperate
with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel in the defense
or contest, make available its personnel, and provide such testimony and
access to its books and records (other than books and records which are
subject to privilege or to confidentiality restrictions) as shall be necessary
in connection with the defense or contest, all at the sole cost and expense
of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party
is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Section 9_).

(d) _Non-assignment; Holding Arrangement_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent the Parties elect or are
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to obtaining
a third party consent identified on _Schedules 3(b)(ii)_ and _8(a)(vi)_ with
respect to any Subject Asset (each a " _Non-Assigned Asset_ "), such Non-
Assigned Asset shall be held by its relevant or appropriate Seller for all
times during the Holding Period (as defined below), and during such Holding
Period (a) Sellers shall provide Buyer with the economic benefits and risks
thereof, (b) Seller shall continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the third party consent(s) related to such Non-Assigned Asset, and
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in such efforts, and (c) Buyer shall be
entitled to enforce at its sole cost and expense, any and all rights of Seller
or the relevant Seller against a third party with respect to such Non-Assigned
Asset; provided that Sellers hereby constitute and appoint (and agree to cause
the relevant or appropriate Seller to constitute and appoint), effective as
of the Closing Date, Buyer and their successors and assigns as the true and
lawful attorney of Sellers, as applicable with full power of substitution in
the name of the Buyer, or in the name of Sellers, but for the benefit of the
Buyer, to institute and prosecute all proceedings which Buyer may in its sole
discretion deem proper in order to assert or enforce any right, title or
interest in, to or under the Non-Assigned Assets or take other actions
reasonably necessary to obtain the benefits of such Non-Assigned Assets, and
to defend or compromise any and all actions, suits or proceedings in respect
of such Non-Assigned Assets. Buyer shall be entitled to retain for its own
account any amounts collected pursuant to the foregoing powers, including any
amounts payable as interest in respect thereof. Seller will promptly pay to
Buyer when received all monies received by Sellers or the relevant Seller
under any Non-Assigned Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder, At such time as the third party consent for a Non-Assigned Asset
is obtained, Sellers shall promptly assign such Non-Assigned  



 

56  Asset to Buyer in a form mutually agreed between the Parties. For purposes
of this Agreement, if the Non-Assigned Asset is an easement or similar right,
then the term Non-Assigned Asset shall include that portion of the associated
plant, facility fixtures or other assets owned by a Company and located
thereon. For purposes of this _Section 6(d)_ the term " _Holding Period_
" for any particular Non-Assigned Asset shall mean the period beginning on
the Closing Date and ending on earlier of the date upon which (i) the contract
for which consent was not obtained expires or (ii) such consent or an
alternative arrangement is obtained on terms that are substantially similar
to Buyer in both operational and economical respects.

(e)  _Ownership of Names; Change in Corporate Name_.

the Closing Date, the Buyer shall own, and have the exclusive right to refer

the following names and/or brands (or any derivation thereof): Davison
Petroleum Products, L.L.C., Davison Transport, Inc., Transport Company, TandT
Chemical, Inc., Fuel Masters, LLC, TDC, L.L.C. and Red River Terminal, L.L.C.,
and to use such references in advertising or in the description or name of
any service or product from time to time purchased, processed, manufactured,
or sold by the Buyer and its Affiliates, whether or not relating to the
Subject Assets. The Buyer and its Affiliates will have the further ownership
and right from and after the Closing Date to sell or otherwise use or dispose
of any materials included in the inventory of the Business that bear the name
of any Company alone or in combination with other words. The Buyer will also
own and have the right from and after the Closing Date to use any signs,
letterhead, invoices or other supplies that bear the name of any Company alone
or in combination with other words. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any and all rights that the Buyer may have or be granted to use the
name Davison hereunder or otherwise in connection with the Subject Business
shall expire, and the rights to such name shall revert back to Sellers or
their successors and assigns, on the date five (5) years after the Closing
Date.

(ii) The Sellers will (and will cause each Company to) take all such action
as may be required, if applicable, to change the name of each Seller, as
promptly as practicable after consummation of the Closing, to one that is (i)
distinctly different in sound and appearance from those listed above and (ii)
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer. After the Closing, the Sellers shall not,
and shall not permit any Affiliates to, (a) take any action to interfere with
the exclusive use by the Buyer of any name and/or brand listed above

of Tax Records that are relevant to Post-Closing Tax Periods and all other
files, books, records, information and data relating to each Company or the
Subject Assets (other than Tax Records) that are in the possession or control
of the Seller; provided that such access shall not be construed to require the
disclosure of records that would cause the waiver of any attorney-client, work
product or like privilege; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in the event of any
litigation nothing herein shall limit any Partys rights of discovery under
applicable Law.

(g) _Collection of Receivables_.

(i) If any Subject Non-Performing Receivable remains uncollected as of the
date of the Closing Statement, and an adjustment has been made for such
receivable in the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital, such Subject
Non-Performing Receivable shall constitute a Retained Asset and Buyer
will reassign to Sellers such uncollected receivable.

(ii) If, after the Closing Date, any Seller or any of their
Affiliates receives any remittance from any account debtors with respect to
the receivables (excluding any receivable reassigned to any Seller or

the Closing, Buyer will call a special meeting of its unitholders to be held
as promptly as practicable (and in no event more than 120 days after Closing)
and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit unitholder
approval of an amendment to the Buyers partnership agreement, in form
mutually satisfactory to the Buyers general partner and the Sellers, to allow
Sellers and their Affiliates to vote (notwithstanding the fact that at the
record date for determining holders entitled to vote on such matters Sellers
and their Affiliates hold more than 20% of Buyers "Outstanding" (as such term
in defined in Buyers partnership agreement) Common Units) on all matters on
which holders of Buyers Common Units have a right to vote other than matters
relating to the succession, election, removal, withdrawal, replacement or
substitution of the general partner of the Buyer. Subject to appropriate
disclosure, including presentation in any proxy solicitation of advantages and
disadvantages of the amendment and conflicts of interest, and to quorum and
other requirements of the Buyers partnership agreement, Genesis GP
shall recommend approval of such amendment, the proxy statement prepared and
distributed for such meeting shall include such recommendation and Genesis GP
and its Affiliates shall commit in the Unitholder Rights Agreement to vote
their common units for approval of such amendment.

priority perfected security interest in and to a number of Units equal to
forty percent (40%) of the Units to be received by such Seller at the Closing

Agreement, which provides that, if no default or event of default under the

and does pay to any third party that is not a Buyer Indemnitee, punitive,
exemplary, special or consequential damages caused by any matter for which

to the extent specified in the immediately preceding sentence with respect
third party claims, Sellers shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnitee for
any exemplary, punitive, special or consequential damages. Sellers may elect

and does pay to any third party that is not a Seller Indemnitee, punitive,
exemplary, special or consequential damages caused by any matter for which
such Seller Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified under this _Section
9(c)_, then such punitive, exemplary, special or consequential damages shall

exceeding, in the aggregate $112,000,000.

(d) _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

(i) If any third party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ")
with respect to any matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that may give rise to a
claim for indemnification against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") under this _Section 9_, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in
any event within five (5) business days after receiving notice of the Third
Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing. Failure to
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent the
defense of such claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys
failure to give such notice, including having the effect of tolling or
suspending the statute of limitations applicable to such claim.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and thereafter
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying
Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim which provides for or
results in any payment by or Obligation of the Indemnified Party of or for any
damages or other amount, any Encumbrance on any property of the Indemnified
Party, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party or any sanction or injunction of, restriction upon the
conduct of any business by, or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably). 

(iii) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third
Party Claim as provided in  _Section 9(d)(i)_, the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem
appropriate.

(iv) In no event shall the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be withheld unreasonably.



 

65 (e) _Indemnification if Negligence of Indemnitee; No Waiver of Rights or
Remedies_. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED IN THIS _SECTION 9_ WILL BE
APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ALLEGED OR PROVEN. THE PARTIES AGREE THE PRECEDING
SENTENCE IS COMMERCIALLY CONSPICUOUS. Each Indemnified Partys rights and
remedies set forth in this Agreement will survive the Closing and will not be
deemed waived by such Indemnified Partys consummation of the Transactions and
will be effective regardless of any inspection or investigation conducted, or
the awareness of any matters acquired (or capable or reasonably capable of
being acquired), by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party or by its
directors, officers, employees, or representatives or at any time (regardless
of whether notice of such knowledge has been given to Indemnitor), whether
before or after the Execution Date or the Closing Date with respect to any
circumstances constituting a condition under this Agreement, unless any
waiver specifically so states.

(f) _Determination of Amount of Adverse Consequences_. The Adverse
Consequences giving rise to any indemnification obligation hereunder shall be
limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified Party (reduced by any
insurance proceeds received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party as
a result of the events giving rise to the claim for indemnification net of
any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds as well as any Tax
Benefit recognized by the Indemnified Party (or the affiliated group of which
it is a member) occasioned by such loss or damage). The amount of the actual
loss and the amount of the indemnity payment shall be computed by taking into
account the timing of the loss or payment, as applicable, using a Prime Rate
plus 2% interest or discount rate, as appropriate. Upon the request of
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying
Party with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate
the amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this _Section 9(f)_.
An Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in
respect of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use
reasonable efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim
and, if such costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount
thereof.

(g) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties hereto agree that all
indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment made
under Section 10 hereof, shall be treated as purchase price adjustments for
Tax purposes.

(h) _Exclusive Post-Closing Remedy_. After the Closing, and except for any
non-monetary, equitable relief to which any Party may be entitled, any
remedies for willful misconduct or fraud, or any relief, remedies or rights
under the Security Agreement regarding the parties thereto and the matters
contained therein, the rights and remedies set forth in this _Section
9_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties
under or with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

(i) _Additional Remedy Matters_. To the extent any claim may be recoverable
pursuant to more than one Section of this _Article 9_ , the indemnified party
may make such claim under any such Section in the alternative.



 

66 (j) _Control by Sellers of Certain Retained Obligations_.

(i) Pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5(o), 6(b) and 9(b)(iii), Sellers
have agreed to retain, discharge and indemnify Buyer with respect to the
Retained Obligations. In addition, Sellers have made certain representations
and warranties hereunder with respect to environmental matters, for which
Sellers have agreed to indemnify Buyer with respect to any breach pursuant
to Section 9(b)(i). Buyer agrees that it will not precipitate the
commencement of a claim for breach of Sections 5(o) or 6(b) or of a claim for
which indemnification is required under Section 9(b) by conducting its own
soil and groundwater sampling events without the prior written approval of
the Sellers, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld (an " __ _Approved
Investigation_ __"); _provided, however_ , that the following shall be
considered an Approved Investigation even if Sellers do not expressly consent
thereto: (1) an investigation required or requested by any Governmental
Authority (2) an investigation required by any Environmental, Health, and
Safety Requirement, (3) an investigation in connection with investigating a
Release of Hazardous Substances by Buyer or (4) investigation conducted
subsequent to a post-Closing Release of Hazardous Substances, a post-Closing
third-party claim relating to alleged off-site releases from the Subject
Assets or a dispute between Buyer and Sellers with respect to whether a
Release of Hazardous Substances constitutes a Retained Obligation or an
obligation of Buyer, reasonably necessary to protect Buyers interest, the
scope of which investigation is limited to addressing the post-Closing Release
of Hazardous Substances, post-Closing third party claim or disputes between
Buyer and Sellers as described above, and are not instituted solely for the
purpose of making claims under this Agreement) provided that Buyer shall
provide reasonable advance notice to Sellers of any investigation pursuant to
clauses (1), (2), (3) or (4) above and permit Sellers or any representation
of Sellers to attend and observe any such investigation.

(ii) Buyer shall promptly provide to Sellers copies of any data or reports
that result from any Approved Investigations. Should Hazardous Substances or
any violation of Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements be discovered
during any Approved Investigation, where the Release of Hazardous Substances
occurred prior to the Closing and therefore constitutes a Retained
Obligation, Sellers, at their sole discretion, shall be responsible for all
investigative, response and remediation activities related to any Retained
Obligation. Buyer and Sellers agree that they shall consult each other prior
to and allow each other to participate in any submission of written
communication or other deliverables owed to the applicable Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction pursuant to Environmental, Health, and Safety
Requirements and meetings or other non-written communications with such
Governmental Authority. Should actions by any of the Sellers be required under
Environmental, Health, and Safety Requirements to address Hazardous Substances
discovered during any Approved Investigation, Buyer agrees to allow Sellers
to perform any investigative and response activities as may be required in
accordance with the least stringent commercially reasonable
closure/remediation standard applicable  



 

67  to non-residential use of the property under applicable Environmental,
Health, and Safety Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ that such
actions, when complete, shall not materially affect the future use or value
of the affected property.

(iii) Buyer agrees to cooperate with Sellers in performing their obligations
hereunder, by (a) upon request, permitting Sellers and their representatives
access, at reasonable times during normal business hours and in a manner which
is not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of Buyer, to the non-
privileged work papers, books and records of Buyer which are reasonably
related to such claims and losses; and (b) providing Sellers and their
contractors with access to the premises to conduct any
necessary investigation or remedial action pursuant to Sellers obligations
hereunder provided that any actions taken by Sellers (or the actions of any
contractor, consultant or other Third Party hired by Sellers) are undertaken
in a commercially reasonable manner to avoid undue disruption to the Buyers
operations.

(iv) The Sellers shall conduct the defense of any Retained Obligation with
counsel of its choice and shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided,
however_ , that the Sellers shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to any Retained Obligation which
provides for or results in any payment by or Obligation of the Buyer or any
Acquired Company of or for any damages or other amount, any Encumbrance on any
of the Subject Assets, any finding of responsibility or liability on the part
of the Buyer, any Acquired Company or the Subject Assets or any sanction or
injunction of, restriction upon the conduct of any business by, or other
equitable relief upon the Buyer, any Acquired Company or the Subject Assets
without the prior written consent of the Buyer, not to be withheld
unreasonably. Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers and provide reasonable access
to Buyers personnel, records and facilities at reasonable times upon the
request of Sellers as may be necessary and desirable for Sellers to so defend
with regard to any Retained Obligation.

(v) Upon notice from Sellers of Sellers assumption of such defense or
handling of matters addressed in this _Section 9(j)_, Sellers shall not be
liable to Buyer for any legal, consulting, or other expenses incurred by
Buyer in connection with the assumed defense or handling thereof, so long as
Sellers comply with their obligations hereunder. Sellers shall have thirty
(30) days after written notice of any Retained Obligations discussed herein is
delivered to Sellers to decide whether or not to assume such defense or
handling of the Retained Obligation. Without affecting its indemnity rights
hereunder, Buyer shall have the right to defend or handle such matters if
Sellers decline to defend or handle or do not make an election in this thirty
(30) day period; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or settle, compromise or otherwise resolve any such
matter that may constitute a Retained Obligation without Sellers prior
written consent, unless such settlement, compromise or resolution includes a
complete and unconditional release of Sellers.



 

68 10\. _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Post-Closing Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed any Post-Closing Tax Returns with
respect to the Acquired Companies and the Subject Assets. The Buyer shall pay
(or cause to be paid) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

(b) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all Pre-Closing Tax Returns with
respect to the Acquired Companies and the Subject Assets. Copies of such Pre-
Closing Tax Returns will be provided to Buyer as soon as practicable. The
Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns. 

(c) _Straddle Periods_. The Buyer shall be responsible for Taxes of the
Subject Assets related to the portion of any Straddle Period occurring after
the Closing Date and for those Taxes constituting Assumed Obligations. The
Sellers shall be responsible for Taxes of the Subject Assets relating to the
portion of any Straddle Period occurring before and on the Closing Date other
than those Taxes constituting Assumed Obligations. With respect to any
Straddle Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Sellers or the
Buyer shall elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the Tax
period. If applicable Law shall not permit the Closing Date to be the last
day of a Tax period, then (i) real or personal property Taxes with respect to
the Subject Assets shall be allocated based on the number of days in the
partial periods ending on the Closing Date and beginning after the Closing
Date, (ii) in the case of all other Taxes based on or in respect of income,
the Tax computed on the basis of the taxable income or loss attributable to
the Subject Assets for each partial period as determined from their books and
records, and (iii) in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of the actual
activities or attributes of the Subject Assets for each partial period as
determined from their books and records.

(d) _Straddle Returns_. The Buyer shall prepare any Straddle Returns. The
Buyer shall deliver, at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for
filing such Straddle Return (including any extension) to the Sellers a
statement setting forth the amount of Tax that each Seller owes, including the
allocation of taxable income, if any, and Taxes under  _Section 10(c)_, and
copies of such Straddle Return. The Sellers shall have the right to review
such Straddle Returns and the allocation of taxable income, if any, and
liability for Taxes and to suggest to the Buyer any reasonable changes to
such Straddle Returns no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the date for
the filing of such Straddle Returns. The Sellers and the Buyer agree to
consult and to attempt to resolve in good faith any issue arising as a result
of the review of such Straddle Returns and allocation of taxable income, if
any, and liability for Taxes and mutually to consent to the filing as promptly
as possible of such Straddle Returns. Not later than five (5) days before the
due date for the payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Returns, the
Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to the Buyer an amount equal to the
Taxes as agreed to by the Buyer and the Sellers as being owed by the Sellers.
If the Buyer and the Sellers cannot agree on the amount of Taxes owed by the
Sellers with respect to a Straddle Return, the Sellers shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Buyer the amount of Taxes reasonably determined by the Sellers
to be owed by the Sellers. Within ten (10) days after such payment, the
Sellers and the Buyer shall refer the matter to an independent "Big-Four"
accounting firm agreed to by the Buyer and the Sellers to arbitrate the
dispute. The Sellers and the Buyer shall equally share the fees and 



 

69  expenses of such accounting firm and its determination as to the amounts
owed by the Sellers and Buyer with respect to a Straddle Return shall be
binding on the Sellers and the Buyer. Within five (5) days after the
determination by such accounting firm, if necessary, the appropriate Party
shall pay the other Party any amount which is determined by such accounting
firm to be owed. The Sellers shall be entitled to reduce their obligation to
pay Taxes with respect to a Straddle Return to the extent deducted in
calculating Adjusted Working Capital or the Purchase Price and by the amount
of any estimated Taxes paid with respect to and which will be treated as a
payment of such Taxes on or before the Closing Date.

(e) _Claims for Refund_. The Buyer shall not, and shall cause each Acquired
Company and any of their Affiliates not to, file any claim for refund of Taxes
with respect to the Subject Assets for whole or partial taxable periods on or
before the Closing Date.

(f) _Indemnification_. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the Sellers against the
Obligations of Buyer pursuant to _Sections 10(h)_  and _10(p)_ and all Taxes
of or with respect to the Subject Assets and the Acquired Companies for any
Post-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any Straddle Period occurring after
the Closing Date. The Sellers agree to indemnify the Buyer against all Taxes
to the extent contemplated by _Section 10(h)_ (other than ad valorem and
property Taxes) of or with respect to the Subject Assets and the Acquired
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of any
Straddle Period occurring on or before the Closing Date.

(g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

(i) The Buyer and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this _Section 10(g)_ and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

(ii) The Buyer and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). 

(iii) The Buyer and the Sellers agree, upon request, to provide the other
Parties with all information that such other Parties may be required to
report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Department
regulations promulgated thereunder.

(h) _Certain Taxes_. The Sellers shall prepare and file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration or similar taxes and fees,  _provided,
however_ , the Sellers shall present to the Buyer such Tax Returns and other
documentation for the Buyers review and consent no later than ten (10) days
before the due date of such Tax Returns and other documentation
(which consent shall not be



 

70  unreasonably withheld or delayed). If required by applicable Law, the Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation. Notwithstanding anything set forth in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, on or
before the date such payments are due from the Sellers, any transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration or similar taxes and fees
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. To the extent deducted in calculating Adjusted Working Capital or the
Purchase Price, Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay all ad valorem
and property taxes relating to the Subject Real Property, and attributable to
periods before the Closing Date. In addition, Sellers agree to cooperate at
Buyers sole cost and expense with Buyers reasonable requests to structure
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in such form as Buyer may
reasonably request to minimize the taxes described in this _Section 10(h)._

(i) _Confidentiality_. Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall
be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns or reports, refund claims, Tax audits, Tax claims
and Tax litigation, or as required by Law.

(j) _Audits_. The Sellers or the Buyer, as applicable, shall provide prompt
written notice to the other Parties of any pending or threatened Tax audit,
assessment or proceeding that it becomes aware of related to the Subject
Assets for whole or partial periods for which it is indemnified by any other
Party hereunder. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the extent
known) describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall
be accompanied by copies of any notice or other document received from or
with any tax authority in respect of any such matters. If an Indemnified Party
has knowledge of an asserted Tax liability with respect to a matter for which
it is to be indemnified hereunder and such party fails to give the
Indemnifying Party prompt notice of such asserted Tax liability, then (I) if
the Indemnifying Party is precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from
contesting the asserted Tax liability in any forum, the Indemnifying Party
shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for any Taxes
arising out of such asserted Tax liability, and (II) if the Indemnifying Party
is not so precluded from contesting, but such failure to give prompt notice
results in a detriment to the Indemnifying Party, then any amount which the
Indemnifying Party is otherwise required to pay the Indemnified Party pursuant
to this _Section 10(j)_ shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment,
_provided_ , the Indemnified Party shall nevertheless be entitled to full
indemnification hereunder to the extent, and only to the extent, that such
party can establish that the Indemnifying Party was not prejudiced by
such failure. This _Section 10(j)_ shall control the procedure for Tax
indemnification matters to the extent it is inconsistent with any other
provision of this Agreement.

(k) _Control of Proceedings_. The party responsible for the Tax under this
Agreement shall control audits and disputes related to such Taxes (including
action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes). The Sellers and the
Buyer shall jointly control, in good faith with each other, audits and
disputes relating to Straddle Periods. Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
with respect to such contests shall be borne by the Sellers and the Buyer in
proportion to their responsibility for such Taxes as set forth in this
Agreement. Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, the noncontrolling
party shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in such
proceedings at its own expense.



 

71 (l) _Powers of Attorney_. The Buyer, each Acquired Company, and their
respective Affiliates shall provide the Sellers and their Affiliates with
such powers of attorney or other authorizing documentation as are reasonably
necessary to empower them to execute and file returns they are responsible for
hereunder, file refund and equivalent claims for Taxes they are responsible
for, and contest, settle, and resolve any audits and disputes that they have
control over under _Section 10(k)_ hereof (including any refund claims which
turn into audits or disputes). 

(m) _Remittance of Refunds_. If the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer
receives a refund of any Taxes that the Sellers are responsible for
hereunder, or if the Sellers or any Affiliate of the Sellers receives a refund
of any Taxes that the Buyer is responsible for hereunder, the party receiving
such refund shall, within 30 days after receipt of such refund, remit it to
the party who has responsibility for such Taxes hereunder. For the purpose of
this _Section 10(m)_, the term "refund" shall include a reduction in Tax and
the use of an overpayment as a credit or other Tax offset, and receipt of a
refund shall occur upon the filing of a Tax Return or an adjustment thereto
using such reduction, overpayment or offset or upon the receipt of cash.

(n) _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Sellers and the Buyer agree that the
actual Purchase Price allocable to the Subject Assets shall be allocated to
the Subject Assets for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting
purposes) as jointly agreed between the Buyer and the Sellers as soon as
practicable, but in any event no later than ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, _provided, however_ , that the Buyer and Sellers agree to
use their commercially reasonable best efforts to agree upon an allocation of
(i) the Cash Consideration portion of the Purchase Price first to tangible
assets and then to intangible assets that are "amortizable Section 197
intangibles" within the meaning of Section 197 of the Code and (ii) the Unit
Consideration Amount of the Purchase Price to intangibles other than
"amortizable Section 197 intangibles," if any, so agreed upon. The Buyer, the
Sellers and their applicable Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns (including
amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner
consistent with such allocation.

(o) _Closing Tax Certificate_. At the Closing, each Seller shall deliver to
the Buyer a certificate in the form of _Exhibit E_ , signed under penalties
of perjury (i) stating it is not (and no Seller is) a foreign corporation,
foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign estate, (ii) providing its U.S.
Employer Identification Number and (iii) providing its address, all pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

(p) _Tax Protection_. The Buyer agrees for the benefit of each Seller that, if
the Buyer directly or indirectly sells, exchanges, transfers, or otherwise
disposes of Subject Assets or any interest therein (without regard to
whether such disposition is voluntary or involuntary) in a transaction that
would cause Buyer or any of the Sellers to recognize gain under Section 704(c)
of the Code, then Buyer shall pay to each affected Seller an amount equal to
the product of (x) the Tax Protection Percentage and (y) the lesser of:

(i) the aggregate federal, state and local income Taxes incurred by such
Seller as a result of the income or gain allocated to, or otherwise recognized
by, such Seller with respect to its Units by reason of such sale, exchange,
transfer or other disposition, or



 

72 (ii) the aggregate federal, state and local income Taxes that would have been
payable by such Seller if the Subject Assets had been sold on the Closing
Date for its fair market value (computed based upon tax rates in effect for
the period during which the event giving rise to the computation hereunder has
occurred), reduced to reflect: 

(A) reductions prior to such disposition in the "book-tax disparity" with
respect to such Subject Assets (but only if and to the extent that such
reduction is matched dollar for dollar by a reduction in the gain allocable to
the Sellers by reason of such sale or other disposition pursuant to Section
704(c) of the Code), and

(B) with respect to a Seller who acquired Units subsequent to the Closing
Date, the reduction in gain that results from such Sellers having a special
inside basis under Section 743 of the Code in the relevant Subject Assets (by
treating the special inside basis as the basis for determining gain on the
deemed sale described in clause (ii)).

For purposes of this _Section 10(p)_, " _Tax Protection Percentage_ " shall
mean:



     |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|--- 
  

From and including:

 |  |

Until:

 |  | Percentage: | 
  Closing Date |  | the 6 month anniversary of Closing Date |  |
100 | % 
  the 6 month anniversary of Closing Date |  | the 12 month anniversary
of Closing Date |  | 80 | % 
  the 12 month anniversary of Closing Date |  | the 18 month anniversary
of Closing Date |  | 60 | % 
  the 18 month anniversary of Closing Date |  | the 24 month anniversary
of Closing Date |  | 40 | % 
  the 24 month anniversary of Closing Date |  | the 36 month anniversary
of Closing Date |  | 10 | % 
  After the 36 month anniversary of Closing Date |  |  |  | 0 | %

(iii) The Sellers may terminate this Agreement, if the Sellers are not in
default or breach of any representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, by giving written notice to the Buyer
at any time before Closing (A) in the event of any inaccuracy, violation or

order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable.

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Except for the obligations under _Sections 11_
and _12_ , if any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 11(a)_
, all rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder shall terminate without
any liability of any Party to any other Party and except that termination of

12\. _Miscellaneous_.

(a) _Confidentiality_.

(i) The Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, not make

be withheld in the Buyers sole discretion).

(ii) The Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, treat and hold as
such all of the Confidential Information and refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. If any
Seller is ever requested or required (by oral question or request for
information or documents in any action) to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Sellers will notify the Buyer promptly of the request or
requirement so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with this Section 12(a)(ii). If, in the absence of a

Confidential Information to the Government Authority, arbitrator, or
mediator; provided, however, that the Sellers will use their commercial

other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion
of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as the Buyer may
designate.

(b)  _Insurance_.

(i) The Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to file, notice, and otherwise

Retained Companies in respect of any fact, circumstance or event relating to
the Subject Assets or Subject Business that occurs or arises after the
Closing.

(ii) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, will file all
insured claims (both before and after Closing) that may be filed under any
Company Insurance Policy issued to it or its Affiliates and will thereafter
coordinate with the other Party to resolve all such claims relating to such
Parties Insurance Rights. 

(c) _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, will each bear

by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including all fees
and expenses of agents, representatives, financial advisors, legal counsel and

inconsistency between this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules, the terms
of this Agreement shall prevail. To the extent of any ambiguity,

Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will prevail.

in this Agreement, the covenants and obligations of, and the representations
and warranties made by or attributable to each Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, including obligations to
make indemnity payments, will be deemed to be made by and attributable to
all Sellers, jointly and severally, and the Buyer will have the right to
pursue remedies against any or all such Persons without any obligation to give
notice to or pursue remedies against any other Person; _provided,_ however,
that from and after the Closing the Acquired Companies shall have no
obligations under, and no liabilities relating to, this Agreement. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that it has irrevocably appointed James E. Davison, an
individual, as its sole representative with power and authority to act under
this Agreement, including making elections under this Agreement, amend or
otherwise modify this Agreement and receiving delivery of the Purchase Price.

any part of any amounts due it or its Affiliates under any Transaction
Agreement by notifying the Sellers that the Buyer is electing to set off the
