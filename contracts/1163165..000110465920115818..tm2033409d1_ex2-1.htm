actions are only effective after the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions. In the event
that any Divestiture Action is proposed by or acceptable to a Governmental Entity, Parent shall have the right to determine
the manner in which to implement the requirement of such Governmental Entity; <U>provided</U>, that in no event shall Parent

Action. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law,
Parent shall take such action, including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such action
(<U>provided</U>, that in no event shall this <U>Section 6.8(b)</U> require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture
Action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect).

foregoing, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.
In addition, subject to the terms of this <U>Section 6.8</U>, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or
other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding that would make consummation of the
Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or

modify or suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date (<U>provided</U>, that in
no event shall this <U>Section 6.8(b)</U> require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that would

satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for

Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this <U>Section

With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or Surviving
Corporation under this <U>Section 6.10</U>, such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to
require that such determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved
by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has
not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three
