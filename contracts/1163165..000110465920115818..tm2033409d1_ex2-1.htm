Merger Sub, the Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company:

  



  

(a)   _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock

-5-

 



    



  

(b)   _Capital Stock of the Company_.

  



  

(i)  Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ ,
each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding any Excluded Shares, any Converted Shares, and
Company Restricted Stock Awards, which shall be treated as set forth in
_Section 3.2(a)_ ) (such shares of Company Common Stock, the " _Eligible
Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent that
number of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As used in this
Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means 1.46.

  



  

(ii)  All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and
Converted Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_ and (C) any cash to be paid
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.3(h)_ , in each case to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon the exchange of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, in accordance with _Section 3.3(a)_.

  



  

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as
treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or
indirect Subsidiary of the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) ("
_Converted Shares_ ") shall automatically be converted into a number
of fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_ ).

  



  

(c)   _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc._ In the event of any change
in (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
Parent Common Stock (including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in
each case issued and outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination,
exchange of shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from
and after the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to
further adjustment in accordance with this _Section 3.1(c)_. Nothing in this
_Section 3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any
action except to the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by,
the terms of this Agreement.

3.2   _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_.

  



  

(a)   _Rollover Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding award of restricted Company Common Stock (a " _Company
Restricted Stock Award_ ") granted pursuant to the Company's 2019 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or any predecessor plan (the "
_Company Stock Plan_ "), other than as provided in _Section 3.2(b)_ , shall
be canceled and converted into an award of restricted Parent Common Stock (a "
_Parent Restricted Stock Award_ ") in respect of that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each Parent Restricted Stock Award
corresponding to a Company Restricted Stock Award outstanding as of the date
hereof shall, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 3.2(a)_ , be
subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

  



  

(b)   _Settlement Restricted Stock Awards_. At the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award granted pursuant to the
Company Stock Plan prior to the date hereof and that fully vests at the
Effective Time pursuant to its terms as in effect as of the date hereof shall
fully vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Performance Unit Awards Generally_. At the Effective Time,
each 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 award of performance
units denominated in shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Performance Unit
Awards_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, other than as provided
in _Section 3.2(d)_ , shall vest and be converted into the right to receive
the "Cash Equivalent Merger Consideration" (as defined below) (which shall be
issued promptly after the Effective Time, or any later date required by
Section 409A of the Code) in respect of a number of shares of Company Common
Stock equal to the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Performance Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time,
with performance deemed satisfied at 200% of target (which is two-thirds
(2/3) of maximum performance), less applicable Taxes required to be withheld.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Cash Equivalent Merger
Consideration_ " means the product of (i) the Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_
(ii) the Parent Closing Price.

  



  

(d)   _Performance Unit Awards Held by Former Employees_. At the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Performance Unit Award granted
pursuant to the Company Stock Plan that is held by an individual who is a
former employee of the Company or its Affiliates as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that remains eligible to vest by its terms shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Cash Equivalent Merger
Consideration (which shall be issued promptly after the Effective Time, or
any later date required by Section 409A of the Code) in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Unit Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the level of satisfaction of any
performance goals that are incomplete as of the Effective Time determined in
accordance with the applicable award agreement based on actual performance as
of the Effective Time determined in the ordinary course and consistent with
past practice, and with the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be

(e)   _Administration_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board and/or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take such
action and adopt such resolutions as are required to (i) effectuate the
treatment of the Company Restricted Stock Awards and the Company Performance
Unit Awards pursuant to the terms of this _Section 3.2_ , (ii) if requested by
Parent in writing, cause the Company Stock Plan to terminate at or prior to
the Effective Time and (iii) take all actions reasonably required to
effectuate any provision of this _Section 3.2_ , including to ensure that from
and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any equity
awards of the Company, including any Company Restricted Stock Awards
or Company Performance Unit Awards.

  



  

(f)   _Future Grants of Equity Awards_. Notwithstanding
anything in _Section 3.2(a)_ through _Section 3.2(d)_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section 6.1(b)_ , (i) to the extent the terms of any Company
Restricted Stock Award or Company Performance Unit Award granted on or after
the date of this Agreement and not in violation of this Agreement expressly
provide for treatment in connection with the occurrence of the Effective Time
that is different from the treatment prescribed by this _Section 3.2_ , or
(ii) as mutually agreed by the Parties and a holder of any Company Restricted
Stock Award or Company Performance Unit Award, then in each case, the terms
of such Company Restricted Stock Award or Company Performance Unit Award, as
applicable, shall control (and the applicable provisions of this _Section
3.2_ shall not apply).

  



     

3.3   _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Parent's or the Company's
transfer agent to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and to receive the
Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares, pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ to which such holders shall
become entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance
with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to
_Section 3.1_. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other
distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section
3.3(a)_ and _Sections 3.3(g)_  and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares
in accordance with _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions
in accordance with _Section 3.3(g)_ ) shall hereinafter be referred to as the
" _Exchange Fund_." Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion of
the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange
Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash
payments contemplated by this _Article III_ , Parent shall promptly replace,
restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash payments contemplated
by this _Article III_. Any interest or other income resulting from investment
of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall become part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable hereunder shall, at
the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.

(b)   _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each
record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an
outstanding certificate or certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented Eligible Shares (" _Certificates_ "), a notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of
transmittal (" _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which
shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior
to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates for payment of the Merger Consideration set forth in _Section
3.1(b)(i)_. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other customary documents
as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash
payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_.

  



  

(ii)   _Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares_. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each
record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Eligible
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") not held through
DTC, (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger,
(B) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the aggregate,
the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (C) a
check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)._

  



  

   

-9-

 



    



  

(iii)   _DTC Book-Entry Shares_. With respect to Book-Entry Shares
held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or
after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by
DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTC's customary surrender procedures,
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or
other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant
to this _Article III_.

  



  

(iv)  No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable
for Eligible Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger
Consideration (including any dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ ) is to
be made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it
shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry
Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ ) shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.3(b)(v)_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common
Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_.

  



  

(c)   _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration
(including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ ) paid upon the surrender
of and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation shall be closed
immediately, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Eligible Shares previously
represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
_Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ , without any interest
thereon.

  



  

   

-10-

 



    



  

(d)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the
Company on the 180th day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have not
theretofore received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_ , in each
case without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this _Article
III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for
payment of their claim for such amounts.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company
Common Stock for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time
that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions
in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)   _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_.

  



  

(g)   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would
be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such
holder, in each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to
dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time.

  



  

   

-11-

 



    



  

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No
certificates or scrip or shares representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the exchange of Eligible Shares and
such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to have any rights of a stockholder of Parent or a holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Eligible Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held
by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent
Common Stock _multiplied by_ (ii) the volume weighted average price of Parent
Common Stock for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending two (2) trading
days prior to the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. (the " _Parent
Closing Price_ "). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the fractions
in the exchange.

  



  

(i)   _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amount required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Law and shall pay the amount deducted or withheld to the
appropriate Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law. Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
shall cooperate in good faith to minimize any such deduction or withholding.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such deducted or withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  



  

3.4   _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Transactions.

Article IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated as of the date of this
Agreement and delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on or prior to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") and except
as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (including all exhibits and
schedules thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with
or furnished to the SEC and available on Edgar since December 31, 2019 and
prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosures set forth or
referenced in any risk factor section or in any other section, in each case,
to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary,
predictive, non-specific or forward-looking in nature), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  



  

4.1   _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company
duly organized, as the case may be, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with all
requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as now being conducted, other than, in the case
of the Company's Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized or to
have such power, authority or standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company (a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the
operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification or
license necessary, other than where the failure to so qualify, license or be
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its Organizational
Documents, each as amended prior to the execution of this Agreement (subject
to the amendment of the Company's Bylaws contemplated by _Section 4.3(a)_ )
and each as made available to Parent is in full force and effect, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of such Organizational Documents.

  



  

4.2   _Capital Structure_.

stock of the Company consists of (i) 300,000,000 shares of Company Common
Stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common
Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_ "). At the close of business on
October 16, 2020: (A) 196,305,223 shares of Company Common Stock were issued
and outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; (B) the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding

remained available for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plan, of which
488,888 shares (assuming satisfaction of applicable performance goals at the
target level) or 1,466,664 shares (assuming satisfaction of applicable
performance goals at the maximum level) of Company Common Stock were
available for issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Performance Unit
Awards.

with (i) applicable securities Laws and other applicable Law and (ii) all
requirements set forth in applicable contracts (including the Company Stock

in this _Section 4.2_ , there are no outstanding options, warrants or other
rights to subscribe for, purchase or acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries any capital stock of the Company or securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock of the Company (and the
exercise, conversion, purchase, exchange or other similar price thereof). All
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the
Subsidiaries of the Company are owned by the Company, or a direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, are free and clear of
all Encumbrances and have been duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Except as set forth in this _Section 4.2_ , and except for
stock grants or other awards granted since the close of business on October
16, 2020 to the date of this Agreement or following the execution of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ , there are outstanding:
(A) no shares of Company Capital Stock, Voting Debt or other voting securities
of the Company, (B) no securities of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company
Capital Stock, Voting Debt or other voting securities of the Company and (C)
no options, warrants, subscriptions, calls, rights (including preemptive and
appreciation rights), commitments or agreements to which the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company is a party or by which it is bound in any case
obligating the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, deliver,
sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold,
purchased, redeemed or acquired, additional shares of Company Capital Stock
or any Voting Debt or other voting securities of the Company, or obligating
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to grant, extend or enter into
any such option, warrant, subscription, call, right, commitment or agreement.
There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or
they are bound relating to the voting of any shares of capital stock or other
equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No Subsidiary of
the Company owns any shares of Company Capital Stock.

  



  

(c)  As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any (1) interests in a material joint venture or,
directly or indirectly, equity securities or other similar equity interests in
any Person or (2) obligations, whether contingent or otherwise, to consummate
any material additional investment in any Person other than its Subsidiaries
and its joint ventures listed on _Schedule 4.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

  



  

4.3   _Authority; No Violations; Consents and Approvals_.

  



  

(a)  The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company,
subject, only with respect to consummation of the Merger, to the Company
Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due and valid execution of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors' rights and to general principles of equity
regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in
equity or at law (collectively, " _Creditors ' Rights_"). The Company Board,
at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote (i) determined that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and holders of
Company Common Stock, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (iii) resolved to
recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock vote in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger (such
recommendation described in this _clause (iii)_ , the " _Company
Board Recommendation_ ") and (iv) adopted resolutions amending and restating
the Bylaws of the Company in the manner previously disclosed to Parent. The
Company Stockholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of the Company Capital Stock necessary to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) (i) contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents of the Company
(assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained) or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, result
in a violation of, a termination (or right of termination) of or default
under, the creation or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under,
any provision of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease or other agreement, permit, franchise or license to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective properties or assets are bound, or
(iii) assuming the Consents referred to in _Section 4.4_ are duly and timely
obtained or made and the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation of any Law applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties
or assets, other than, in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , any such
contraventions, conflicts, violations, defaults, acceleration, losses, or
Encumbrances that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not party to
any contract, arrangement or other commitment that does, would or would
reasonably be expected to entitle any Person to appoint one or more directors
to the Company Board.

  



  

4.4   _Consents_. No Consent from any Governmental Entity is
required to be obtained or made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by

(a) Since December 31, 2018 (the " _Applicable Date_ "), the
Company has filed or furnished with the SEC, on a timely basis, all forms,
reports, certifications, schedules, statements and documents required to be
filed or furnished under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,

interpretive data supplied by the Company to the Company Independent
Petroleum Engineers relating to the Company interests referred to in the
Company Reserve Reports, by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries
that was material to such firm's estimates of proved oil and gas
reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve

such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in
the Company Reserve Reports are derived from reports that have been prepared

timely paid, (ii) all royalties, minimum royalties, overriding royalties and

Company's knowledge, no third party operator) has violated any provision of,
or taken or failed to take any act that, with or without notice, lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default under the provisions of any Oil and
Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil
and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(d)  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being received by them in
a timely manner and are not being held in suspense (by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any third party operator thereof or any other Person) for any
reason other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order title

thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein) filed with or
furnished to the SEC and available on Edgar since December 31, 2019 and prior

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any provision of any loan or credit

Encumbrances that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or

commitment that does, would or would reasonably be expected to entitle any
Person to appoint one or more directors to the Parent Board.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  



  

(i) the Company Board may, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, make such disclosures as the Company Board determines in good faith
are necessary to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or other disclosure required to be made in the Joint Proxy
Statement by applicable U.S. federal securities laws; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying

Company Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.1(c)_ ;

  



  

(ii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company and its Representatives may engage in the activities

Company Competing Proposal from such Person that was not solicited at any
time following the execution of this Agreement and (2) such Company Competing
Proposal did not arise from a breach of the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.3_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no information that is
prohibited from being furnished pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ may be furnished
until the Company receives an executed confidentiality agreement from such
Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure of non-public
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company that are
no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Company Board in good faith
after consultation with its legal counsel; ( _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
such confidentiality agreement does not contain provisions which prohibit the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 6.3_ or that otherwise prohibits the Company from complying with the
provisions of this _Section 6.3_), (B) that any such non-public information
has previously been made available to, or is made available to, Parent prior
to or concurrently with (or in the case of oral non-public information only,
promptly (and in any event within the shorter of one (1) Business Day and 48
hours) after) the time such information is made available to such Person, (C)
prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board or any committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Competing Proposal is, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal and (D) prior
to taking any such actions, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

  



  

   

-48-

 



    



     

(iii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Company Competing Proposal
from a third party that was not solicited at any time following the execution
of this Agreement and did not arise from a breach of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.3_ , if the Company Board so chooses, the Company
Board may effect a Company Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such a Company Change of Recommendation may not be made unless and
until:

  



  

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Company Competing
Proposal is a Company Superior Proposal;

  



  

(B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to such Company Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

  



  

(C) the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof three (3) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Company Board intends to consider whether
to take such action and include a copy of the available proposed Company
Competing Proposal and any applicable transaction and financing documents;

  



  

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers,
employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board not to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response
thereto; and

  



  

   

-49-

 



    



  

(E) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period, prior to taking
action to effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board takes
into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by Parent in
response to the notice, and determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company
Competing Proposal remains a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , that in the event of any material amendment or material
modification to any Company Superior Proposal (it being understood that any
amendment or modification to the economic terms of any such Company Superior
Proposal shall be deemed material), the Company shall be required to deliver
a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 6.3(e)(iii)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that
the advance written notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.3(e)(iii)
_shall be reduced to one (1) Business Day; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
such new written notice shall in no event shorten the original three (3)
Business Day notice period; and

  



  

(iv) prior to, but not after, receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, in response to a Company Intervening Event that occurs or arises
after the date of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in connection
with a breach of this Agreement by the Company, the Company may, if the
Company Board so chooses, effect a Company Change of Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such a Company Change of Recommendation may not
be made unless and until:

  



  

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that a Company Intervening
Event has occurred;

  



  

(B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

  



  

(C) the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof three (3) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Company Board intends to consider whether
to take such action and includes a reasonably detailed description of the
facts and circumstances of the Company Intervening Event;

  



  

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company
Change of Recommendation, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers,
employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board not to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response
thereto; and

  



  

   

-50-

 



    



  

(E) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period, prior to
taking action to effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board
takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered by Parent in
response to the notice, and determines in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to
effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;
provided, that in the event of any material changes regarding any
Company Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new
written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section
6.3(e)(iv)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the advance
written notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.3(e)(iv)_ shall be
reduced to one (1) Business Day; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such new
written notice shall in no event shorten the original three (3) Business Day
notice period.

  



    

  

(f) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company
shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate, amend,
modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 6.3_ , prior to,
but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if, in
response to an unsolicited request from a third party to waive any
"standstill" or similar provision, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties owed by
the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law,
the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar provision solely to
the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Company Competing
Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board and communicate such
waiver to the applicable third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall advise Parent at least two (2) Business Days prior to
taking such action. The Company represents and warrants to Parent that it has
not taken any action that (i) would be prohibited by this _Section 6.3(f)_ or
(ii) but for the ability to avoid actions inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, would have been prohibited by this _Section 6.3(f)_, in each
case, during the thirty (30) days prior to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.3_ ,
any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by any Representative of the
Company acting at the Company's direction or on its behalf, in each case, in
violation of this _Section 6.3_ , shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.3_ by the Company.

Business Day prior to the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting); or

  



  

(vii) cause or permit Parent to enter into a Parent Alternative
Transaction Agreement (together with any of the actions set forth in the
foregoing _clauses (i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ and _(vi)_ , a "
_Parent Change of Recommendation_ ").

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

  



  

(i) the Parent Board may, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, make such disclosures as the Parent Board determines in good faith
are necessary to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or other disclosure required to be made in the Joint Proxy
Statement by applicable U.S. federal securities laws; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying
the Parent Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
Parent Change of Recommendation and the Company shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.1(c)_ ;

  



  

(ii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, Parent and its Representatives may engage in the activities
prohibited by _Sections 6.4(b)(ii)_ or _6.4(b)(iii)_ (and, only with respect
to a Parent Competing Proposal that satisfies the requirements in the
following _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ , may solicit, propose,
knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate any inquiry or the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to such Parent Competing Proposal or any
modification thereto) with any Person if (1) Parent receives a _bona fide_
written Parent Competing Proposal from such Person that was not solicited at
any time following the execution of this Agreement and (2) such
Parent Competing Proposal did not arise from a breach of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) no
information that is prohibited from being furnished pursuant to _Section
6.4(b)_ may be furnished until Parent receives an executed confidentiality
agreement from such Person containing limitations on the use and disclosure
of non-public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent
that are no less favorable to Parent in the aggregate than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, as determined by the Parent Board in good faith
after consultation with its legal counsel; ( _provided_ , _further_ , that
such confidentiality agreement does not contain provisions which prohibit
Parent from providing any information to the Company in accordance with this
_Section 6.4_ or that otherwise prohibits Parent from complying with the
provisions of this _Section 6.4_), (B) that any such non-public information
has previously been made available to, or is made available to, the Company
prior to or concurrently with (or in the case of oral non-public information
only, promptly (and in any event within the shorter of one (1) Business Day
and 48 hours) after) the time such information is made available to such
Person, (C) prior to taking any such actions, the Parent Board or any
committee thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Competing
Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Superior
Proposal and (D) prior to taking any such actions, the Parent Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Law;

  



  

   

-54-

 



    



  

(iii) prior to, but not after, the receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Parent Competing Proposal from
a third party that (x) was not solicited at any time following the execution
of this Agreement, (y) is expressly conditioned upon the non-consummation of
the Transactions (including the failure of any of the conditions in
_Article VII_ to be satisfied) and (z) did not arise from a breach of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_ , if the Parent Board so chooses,
the Parent Board may effect a Parent Change of Recommendation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such a Parent Change of Recommendation may not be made
unless and until:

  



  

(A) the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Parent Competing
Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal;

  



  

(B) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation in response to such Parent Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law;

  



  

(C) Parent provides the Company written notice of such proposed
action and the basis thereof three (3) Business Days in advance, which notice
shall set forth in writing that the Parent Board intends to consider whether
to take such action and include a copy of the available proposed Parent
Competing Proposal and any applicable transaction and financing documents;

  



  

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Parent Change
of Recommendation, Parent negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Parent Board not to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response
thereto; and

  



  

   

-55-

 



    



  

(E) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period, prior to taking
action to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, the Parent Board takes
into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Company in writing and any other information offered by the
Company in response to the notice, and determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
Parent Competing Proposal remains a Parent Superior Proposal and that the
failure to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response to such Parent
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law; _provided_
, that in the event of any material amendment or material modification to any
Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood that any amendment or
modification to the economic terms of any such Parent Superior Proposal shall
be deemed material), Parent shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to the Company and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 6.4(e)(iii)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that
the advance written notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.4(e)(iii)_
shall be reduced to one (1) Business Day; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
such new written notice shall in no event shorten the original three (3)
Business Day notice period; and

  



  

(iv) prior to, but not after, receipt of the Parent Stockholder
Approval, in response to a Parent Intervening Event that occurs or arises
after the date of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in connection
with a breach of this Agreement by Parent, Parent may, if the Parent Board so
chooses, effect a Parent Change of Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such a Parent Change of Recommendation may not be made unless and until:

  



  

(A) the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel that a Parent Intervening
Event has occurred;

  



  

(B) the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Parent Change of
Recommendation in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Law;

  



  

(C) Parent provides the Company written notice of such proposed action
and the basis thereof three (3) Business Days in advance, which notice shall
set forth in writing that the Parent Board intends to consider whether to take
such action and includes a reasonably detailed description of the facts and
circumstances of the Parent Intervening Event;

  



  

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Parent Change
of Recommendation, Parent negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Parent Board not to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response
thereto; and

  



  

   

-56-

 



    



  

(E) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period, prior to taking
action to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation, the Parent Board takes
into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Company in writing and any other information offered by the
Company in response to the notice, and determines in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation in response to such
Parent Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed
by the Parent Board to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law;
provided, that in the event of any material changes regarding any Parent
Intervening Event, Parent shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to the Company and to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 6.4(e)(iv)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the
advance written notice obligation set forth in this _Section 6.4(e)(iv)_
shall be reduced to one (1) Business Day; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
such new written notice shall in no event shorten the original three (3)
Business Day notice period.

  



  

(f) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ , Parent shall
not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate, amend, modify or
waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding any other provision in this _Section 6.4_ , prior to, but not
after, the time the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, if, in response
to an unsolicited request from a third party to waive any "standstill" or
similar provision, the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties owed by the Parent
Board to the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law, Parent may waive any
such "standstill" or similar provision solely to the extent necessary to
permit a third party to make a Parent Competing Proposal, on a confidential
basis, to the Parent Board and communicate such waiver to the applicable
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall advise the Company at
least two (2) Business Days prior to taking such action. Parent represents and
warrants to the Company that it has not taken any action that (i) would be
prohibited by this _Section 6.4(f)_ or (ii) but for the ability to avoid
actions inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to
the stockholders of Parent under applicable Law, would have been prohibited
by this _Section 6.4(f)_, in each case, during the thirty (30) days prior to
the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.4_ ,
any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by a director or officer
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by any Representative of Parent acting
at Parent's direction or on its behalf, in each case, in violation of this
_Section 6.4_ , shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.4_  by
Parent.

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration
Statement_.

  



  

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and
information relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the
holders of its capital stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the
purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement
and any amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the
adoption by its stockholders of this Agreement. The Company will promptly
furnish to Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries
and the holders of its capital stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the
purpose of including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.

  



  

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in preparing and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause to be filed with the SEC within thirty (30) days of the date of this
Agreement, (i) a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to the
matters to be submitted to the holders of Company Common Stock at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the holders of Parent Common Stock at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting and (ii) the Registration Statement (of which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be a part). The Company and Parent shall each use
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent
and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective under the Securities Act as soon
after such filing as reasonably practicable and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will
advise the other promptly after it receives any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon and responses thereto or any request by the SEC for
additional information. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the
Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other and (iii)
shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving
the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Company shall make all necessary filings with
respect to the Merger and the Transactions under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and applicable "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Each Party will advise the other, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction. Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts
to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated.

  



  

   

-58-

 



    



  

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company and Parent.

  



  

6.6 _Stockholders Meetings_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give
notice of, convene and hold (in person or virtually, in accordance with
applicable Law) a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC
and the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and in any
event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting within forty-
five (45) days thereof). Except as permitted by _Section 6.3_ , the Company
Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the
Company Board shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include
the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required to adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy
Statement is provided to the Company's stockholders or (B) if, as of the time
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company
Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by
the Parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date that is more than ten (10) Business Days after the date
for which the meeting was previously scheduled ( _it being understood_ that
such Company Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time
the circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_
 exist, and, with Parent's consent, such Company Stockholders Meeting may be
adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the
foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and _provided further_ that the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or
after two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date. If requested by Parent,
the Company shall promptly provide all voting tabulation reports relating to
the Company Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or
the Company's transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and
shall otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of the
solicitation and any material oral or written communications from or to the
Company's stockholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Company
Change of Recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.3_ , the Parties agree
to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against any
efforts by any of the Company's stockholders or any other Person to prevent
the Company Stockholder Approval from being obtained. Once the Company has
established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company
shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or
in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder. Without
the prior written consent of Parent or as required by applicable Law, (i) the
adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than a non-binding
advisory proposal regarding compensation that may be paid or become payable
to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger
and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by
the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any
proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly
give notice of, convene and hold (in person or virtually, in accordance with
applicable Law) a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC
and the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and in
any event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting within
forty-five (45) days thereof). Except as permitted by _Section 6.4_ , the
Parent Board shall recommend that the stockholders of Parent vote in favor of
the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Parent Board shall
solicit from stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of the Parent
Stock Issuance, and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Parent Board
Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent
Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally
required supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to
Parent's stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct business at such Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii)
may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time
for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not
be adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than ten (10) Business Days
after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being
understood that such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or
postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing
_clauses (i)(A)_ and _(i)(B)_ exist, and, with the Company's consent, such
Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and _provided
further_  that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date.
If requested by the Company, Parent shall promptly provide all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting that have been
prepared by Parent or Parent's transfer agent, proxy solicitor or
other Representative, and shall otherwise keep the Company reasonably
informed regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or
written communications from or to Parent's stockholders with respect thereto.
Unless there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with
_Section 6.4_ , the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best
efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Parent's stockholders or
any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval from being
obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without
the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by
applicable Law or its Organizational Documents or in connection with
a postponement or adjournment permitted hereunder.

(c) The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to set the record dates for and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on the same day.

  



  

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the
Company and Parent agrees that its obligations to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable,
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not be affected by the making of a
Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of Recommendation, as
applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not be
affected by the commencement, announcement, disclosure, or communication to
the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any Company Competing Proposal or
Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal (including, as applicable, a
Company Superior Proposal or Parent Superior Proposal) or the occurrence or
disclosure of any Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event.

  



  

(e) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other Party or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, neither the Company nor Parent shall hold or convene any meeting of its
stockholders other than the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable.

  



  

(f) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
duly approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational
Documents of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or
action by written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.

6.7 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this
_Section 6.7_ , the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration
Statement, or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and its Representatives, during the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.1_ , reasonable access, at reasonable
times upon reasonable prior notice, to the officers, key employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and to their books, records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and
its Representatives such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries'
business, properties, contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably
requested, from time to time, by or on behalf of Parent; _provided_ , that
such access may be limited by the Company to the extent reasonably necessary
(i) for the Company to comply with any applicable COVID-19 Measures or (ii)
for such access, in light of COVID-19 or COVID-19 Measures, not to jeopardize
the health and safety of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives or commercial partners ( _provided_ that, in the case of each
of _clauses (i) and (ii)_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access
as can be provided (or otherwise convey such information regarding the
applicable matter as can be conveyed) in a manner without risking the health
and safety of such Persons or violating such COVID-19 Measures). Parent and
its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause any unreasonable interference with
the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Notwithstanding the foregoing:

  



  

(i) No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to, grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the
other Party or any of its Representatives to the extent that such information
is subject to an attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product
doctrine or that such access or the furnishing of such information, as
applicable, is prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or
agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , the Company or Parent, as applicable,
shall inform the other Party as to the general nature of what is being
withheld and the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure that does
not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through the use
of commercially reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or
waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (B)
implement appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure
of such information in a manner to remove the basis for the objection,
including by arrangement of appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or
entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information
to be so provided, if the Parties determine that doing so would reasonably
permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or
jeopardizing such privilege);

  



  

   

-62-

 



    



  

(ii) No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information that in the other
Party's good faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other
Party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability;

  



  

(iii) Parent shall not be permitted to conduct any sampling or
analysis of any environmental media or building materials at any facility of
the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Company (granted or withheld in its sole discretion); and

  



  

(iv) no investigation or information provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.7_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein.

  



  

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of October 5, 2020 between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all
information furnished thereunder or hereunder; _provided_ , that paragraph 9
of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no force and effect as of the
date hereof. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_ , each Party shall continue to provide access to the other
Party and its Representatives to the data relating to the Transactions
maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party and its
Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

6.8 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to
Antitrust Laws to which _Sections 6.8(b)_ and _6.8(c)_ , and not this
_Section 6.8(a)_ , shall apply, promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the Parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate
Governmental Entities and other third parties all authorizations, consents,
notifications, certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that
are necessary in order to consummate the Transactions and shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but
subject to _Sections 6.8(b)_ and _6.8(c)_ ), in no event shall either the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay
any consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any
such Person's authorization, approval, consent or waiver to effectuate the
Transactions, other than filing, recordation or similar fees. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions (including the Joint Proxy Statement). The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with
respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits,
expirations of waiting periods or authorizations in connection with the
Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent,
subject to _Section 6.8(b)_ , may be withheld in Parent's sole discretion).

  



  

   

-63-

 



    



   



  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution
of this Agreement, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, the Parties shall make any filings
required under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
fully with each other and shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filings under any applicable Antitrust
Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for
information from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying,
administering, or investigating the HSR Act or any other Law designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of mergers,
monopolization, restraining trade, lessening of competition or abusing a
dominant position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any
state of the United States, or any other competition authority of
any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ "). Parent and the Company shall
keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from any Antitrust
Authority. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take
any and all action necessary, including but not limited to (i) selling or
otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise
dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating
existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any venture or
other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries or (v)
effectuating any other change or restructuring of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to enter into agreements or
stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file appropriate applications
with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any of the foregoing and in
the case of actions by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
its or their businesses or assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
action may, at the discretion of the Company or Parent, be conditioned upon
consummation of the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") to ensure that
no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment, decree, ruling,
injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law or other action
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the
consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority with
the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of
the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_
, that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take
(and the Company shall not take or agree to take) any Divestiture Action or
other action that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition
or operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time
(but, for purposes of determining whether any effect is material, calculated
as if Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time
were collectively the same size as Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time), taken as a whole (a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_
"). Notwithstanding any other provisions of this _Section 6.8_ , nothing in
this Agreement shall require Parent to take or agree to take any Divestiture
Action or other action (other than _de minimis_ actions) with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (from and after the Effective Time)). The Company shall agree to
take any Divestiture Action requested by Parent if such actions are only
effective after the Effective Time and conditioned upon the consummation of
the Transactions. In the event that any Divestiture Action is proposed by or
acceptable to a Governmental Entity, Parent shall have the right to
determine the manner in which to implement the requirement of such
Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent or the
Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) be
required to take or effect any such action that is not conditioned upon the
consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall
consult with the Company and give consideration to the views of the Company
on all matters relating to any possible Divestiture Action. In the event that
any action is threatened or instituted challenging the Merger as violative of
any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take such action, including any Divestiture
Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or resolve such action (
_provided_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.8(b)_ require Parent to
make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material
Adverse Effect). Parent shall be entitled to direct any Proceedings with any
Antitrust Authority or other Person relating to any of the foregoing,
_provided_ , _however_ , that it shall afford the Company a reasonable
opportunity to participate therein. In addition, subject to the terms of this
_Section 6.8_ , in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction
or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in
any Proceeding that would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
Parent shall take promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or
suspend such injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to
the End Date ( _provided_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.8(b)_
require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect). The Parties shall take reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this _Section 6.8(b)_ so as to preserve any applicable
privilege.

(c)  Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could
reasonably be expected to hinder or delay in any material respect the
obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under
the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

  



  

6.9   _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a)  Until December 31 of the calendar year in which the Effective
Time occurs, Parent shall cause each individual who is employed as of the
Closing Date by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof (a " _Company Employee_ ")
and who remains employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) to be provided with (i)
a total target cash compensation opportunity (consisting of base salary or
wages, as applicable, and annual cash incentive opportunity) that is no less
favorable than that provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, _provided_ that a Company Employee's base compensation (salary
or wages, as applicable) shall not be reduced below the level in effect
for such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii)
eligibility for equity compensation to the same extent as provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that the
amount of such equity compensation may be adjusted to avoid duplication that
otherwise may arise as a result of differences in timing of grants by the
Company prior to the Closing Date and by Parent following the Closing Date;
(iii) employee benefits (including retirement plan participation but
excluding severance benefits) at a level that is no less favorable in the
aggregate than that in effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date; and (iv) eligibility for severance benefits on the same
terms as similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

(b)   From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Company Employees for purposes
of vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual under the Parent Plans (other
than with respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, retiree medical, dental or life benefits or disability benefits or to
the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits) in which the Company
Employees participate, for such Company Employees' service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such
service was taken into account under a corresponding Company Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give service credit for long
term disability coverage purposes for the Company Employees' service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c)  From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of any Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents
due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting periods, active employment
requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the
applicable health and welfare Parent Plan to the extent such Company Employee
and his or her eligible dependents are covered under a Company Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such conditions, periods or
requirements are satisfied or waived under such Company Plan and (ii) give
each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has
been made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance
plan provider.

  



  

(d)  From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to assume and honor
their respective obligations under the Company's Executive Severance Plan.

  



  

(e)  Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in
writing, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions and
take all such corporate action as is necessary to terminate each 401(k) plan
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plans_ "), in each case,
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company 401(k)
Plans have been properly terminated, the form of such termination documents
shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Parent. To the extent the
Company 401(k) Plans are terminated pursuant to Parent's request, the Company
Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, and such Company
Employees shall be entitled to effect a direct rollover of any eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code),
including any outstanding loans, to such 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or
its Subsidiaries.

(f) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and
other paid time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or one of its Subsidiaries will assume and honor all unused vacation and
other paid time off days accrued or earned, pursuant to the terms of the
applicable Company Plan as in effect on the date hereof, by such Company
Employee prior to the Closing Date for the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

  



  

(g)  Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to,
or be construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained
or contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are for the sole benefit
of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee
of the Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third-party
beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with
respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.9_ ) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates (i) from amending or terminating any of their respective
Employee Benefit Plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Plan in
accordance with their terms or (ii) after the Effective Time,
from terminating the employment of any Company Employee.

  



  

6.10   _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person
may have pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in
effect on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a
fiduciary under any Company Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity
(the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
fines, penalties, expenses (including attorneys' and other professionals'
fees and expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement, of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
Proceeding to which such Indemnified Person is a party or is
otherwise involved (including as a witness) based, in whole or in part, on or
arising, in whole or in part, out of the fact that such Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary
under any Company Plan or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other enterprise, as applicable, or by reason
of anything done or not done by such Person in any such capacity, whether
pertaining to any act or omission occurring or existing prior to or at, but
not after, the Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (" _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all
Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or
in part out of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the Transactions, in
each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses
incurred in connection therewith in advance of the final disposition of any
such Proceeding to each Indemnified Person to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
Proceeding is brought or threatened to be brought against any Indemnified
Persons (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnified Persons may retain the Company's regularly engaged legal counsel
or other counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements therefor are received,
and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to
assist in the defense of any such matter. Any Indemnified Person wishing to
claim indemnification or advancement of expenses under this _Section 6.10_ ,
upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall notify the Surviving Corporation
(but the failure so to notify shall not relieve a Party from any obligations
that it may have under this _Section 6.10_ except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices such Party's position with respect to such
claims). With respect to any determination of whether any Indemnified Person
is entitled to indemnification by Parent or Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.10_ , such Indemnified Person shall have the right, as contemplated
by the DGCL, to require that such determination be made by special,
independent legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Person and approved by
Parent or Surviving Corporation, as applicable (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and who has not otherwise performed
material services for Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Indemnified Person
within the last three (3) years.

(b)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that would
affect (or manage the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the
intent to or in a manner that would) adversely the rights thereunder of any
Indemnified Person to indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to
the extent required by applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense
advancement or exculpation agreements between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any of its directors or officers existing and in effect
prior to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any
Indemnified Person against all reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), such amounts to be
payable in advance upon request as provided in _Section 6.10(a)_ , relating
to the enforcement of such Indemnified Person's rights under this _Section
6.10_ or under any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of whether such
Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder or thereunder.

  



  

(d)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in
place, and Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time,
"tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
the Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Company's
existing policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to, but not after, the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance
exceed during the Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium
paid by the Company for such purpose; and provided, _further_ , that if the
cost of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assignees (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not
sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their assets in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this _Section
6.10_. The provisions of this _Section 6.10_  are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each Person entitled
to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense advancement pursuant to
this _Section 6.10_ , and his heirs and Representatives. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.10_ are in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Persons may have under the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable contracts or
Law. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.10_.

  



  

6.11   _Transaction Litigation_. In the event any Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced or, to the knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened, that questions the validity or
legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith,
including stockholder litigation (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other Party of
such Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other Party
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or
settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall consult regularly with
Parent in good faith and give reasonable consideration to Parent's advice
with respect to such Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , that the Company
shall not cease to defend, consent to the entry of any judgment, settle or
offer to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect
to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by the Parties. No Party shall, and each will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior
written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party,
its Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public announcement or
other public disclosures (a) required by applicable Law, (b) required by the
rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party's or its Subsidiary's
capital stock is traded or (c) consistent with the final form of the joint
press release announcing the Merger and the investor presentation given to
investors on the morning of announcement of the Merger; _provided_ , in each
case, such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other Party an
opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide
reasonable comments thereon; and _provided_ , _however_ , that no provision
in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner a Party's ability
to communicate with its employees ( _provided_ , that prior to making any
written (or prepared broad-based) communications to the directors, officers
or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to
compensation or benefit matters that are affected by the Transactions or
compensation or benefits that are payable or to be provided following the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication (or written summary of any prepared broad-based
oral communication), the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable period of
time to review and comment on the communication, and the Company shall
consider any timely comments in good faith) and that neither Party shall be
required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or obtain any
approval from any other Party with respect to a public announcement or
press release issued in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Company Competing Proposal or a Parent Competing Proposal, as applicable, and
matters related thereto or a Company Change of Recommendation or Parent Change
of Recommendation, as applicable, other than as set forth in _Section 6.3_ or
_Section 6.4_ , as applicable.

6.13   _Advice of Certain Matters; Control of Business_. Subject to
compliance with applicable Law, the Company and Parent, as the case may be,
shall confer on a regular basis with each other and shall promptly advise each
other orally and in writing of any change or event having, or which would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may
be. Except with respect to Antitrust Laws as provided in _Section 6.8_ , the
Company and Parent shall promptly provide each other (or their respective
counsel) copies of all filings made by such Party or its Subsidiaries with
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions. Without limiting in any way any Party's rights or
obligations under this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give any Party, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the other Party and their respective Subsidiaries' operations prior to the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parties shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective
operations.

  



  

6.14   _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification_.

  



  

(a)  Except to the extent that the Parties' obligations are
specifically set forth elsewhere in this _Article VI_  (including filings,
notifications, required efforts, actions and other matters with respect to
Antitrust Laws governed by _Section 6.8_ ), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 6.3_ ), each of
the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Merger and the other Transactions.

  



  

(b) Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise required by any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the consummation of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as applicable, or
any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Transactions (including those alleging that the approval or
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon becoming aware of (i) any
condition, event or circumstance that will result in any of the conditions in
_Sections 7.2(a)_ or _7.3(a)_ not being met, or (ii) the failure by such
Party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties or
the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or will become subject to
such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

6.16   _Stock Exchange Listing and Delistings_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the shares of Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of
the shares of Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than ten (10)
days after the Effective Time. If the Surviving Corporation is required to
file any quarterly or annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act by a filing
deadline that is imposed by the Exchange Act and which falls on a date within
the fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date, the Company shall make
available to Parent, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, a substantially final draft of any such annual or quarterly report
reasonably likely to be required to be filed during such period.

(a) If requested by Parent in writing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to deliver all notices and take all
other actions reasonably necessary to facilitate (i) the termination at the

furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a draft payoff letter
(and, at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, a
payoff letter that has been executed by the applicable agent for the lenders
thereunder) with respect to the Existing Credit Facility in form and
substance customary for transactions of this type, from the applicable agent
on behalf of the persons to whom such indebtedness is owed.

(b) Parent or one or more of its Subsidiaries may (i) commence
any of the following: (A) one or more offers to purchase any or all of the
outstanding debt issued under the Indentures for cash (the " _Offers to
Purchase_ ") or (B) one or more offers to exchange any or all of the
outstanding debt issued under the Indentures for securities issued by Parent

"); _provided_ that the closing of any such transaction shall be
conditioned on the occurrence of, and shall not be consummated until, the
Closing and any such transaction shall be funded solely using consideration
provided by Parent. Any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations shall be
made on such terms and conditions (including price to be paid and
conditionality) as are proposed by Parent and which are permitted by the terms
of the applicable Indenture and applicable Laws, including SEC rules and
regulations. Parent shall consult with the Company regarding the material
terms and conditions of any Company Note Offers and Consent Solicitations,
including the timing and commencement of any Company Note Offers and Consent
Solicitations and any tender deadlines. Parent shall have provided
the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent
solicitation statement, letter of transmittal and press release, if any, in
connection therewith, and each other document relevant to the transaction that
will be distributed by Parent in the applicable Company Note Offers and
Consent Solicitations (collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ ") a
reasonable period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Company Note
Offers and Consent Solicitations to allow the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Debt Offer Documents,
and Parent shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made or input provided by the Company and its legal counsel; _provided_ that
such Debt Offer Documents shall not include any non-public
information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives unless the Company approves such disclosures in
writing. Subject to the receipt of the requisite holder consents, in
connection with any or all of the Consent Solicitations, the Company shall
execute a supplemental indenture to the applicable Indenture in accordance

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts and

the Transactions.

quarterly dividend is declared and the record date with respect to any
quarterly dividend shall be no later than five (5) Business Days following the

preceding year; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the quarter in which
the Closing occurs, if the record date of Parent's quarterly dividend has

9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has been
represented by counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have
preceded the execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same
with the advice of said independent counsel. Each Party and its counsel
cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents
referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between
the Parties shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be
construed against any Party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived.

  



  

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission
or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of
such information in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such items are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may
be, or that such items have resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual
sections of each of the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Company Disclosure
Letter are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed
to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are arranged in sections
corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely for convenience, and
the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception to a
particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as
an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the presence or absence
of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter with respect to such other representations or warranties or
an appropriate cross reference thereto.

(c)  The specification of any dollar amount in the
representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality
of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties to determine whether any obligation, item or
matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(d)  All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits,
Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to

to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,

intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached

_Section 8.1_, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of
specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this

under the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable
remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of
such Party under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 9.11_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other
Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 9.11_ , and each Party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. If prior to the End Date, any Party hereto
brings an action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended by such other time period established by the court presiding over
such action.

9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which

obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

  



  

9.13   _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,

(b)  waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto; or

  



  

(c)  waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
of the other Party contained herein.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party.
