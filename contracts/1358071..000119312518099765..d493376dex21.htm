2.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ "), shall take place at 9:00

a certificate of merger prepared and executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") shall be filed with
the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall become effective upon the filing and acceptance of the Certificate of
Merger with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such later time as shall be agreed upon in writing by Parent and the
Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_
").

2.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety as of the Effective Time to be in the form set forth in _Annex B_ ,
and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until duly amended, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)_, as

EXCHANGE

 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, or any holder of any securities of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and shall represent one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which
shall constitute the only outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time.

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ , each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common
Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding any Excluded Shares and any shares of Time-Based Restricted Stock
and Performance-Based Restricted Stock, that are not treated as shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
3.2(b)_, respectively) (such shares of Company Common Stock, together with
any shares of Time-Based Restricted Stock and Performance-Based Restricted
Stock which are treated as shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b),_ the " _Eligible Shares_
") shall be converted into the right to receive from Parent that number of
fully-paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As used in this Agreement, "
_Exchange Ratio_ " means 0.320.

(ii) All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to
exist. Each holder of a share of Company Common Stock that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration, (B)
any dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_ and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of

to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the exchange of any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_.

(iii) All shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
shares or by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and, in each case, not
held on behalf of third parties (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



6 (c) _Impact of Stock Splits, Etc._ In the event of any change in (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock or (ii)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock
(including options to purchase Parent Common Stock), in each case issued and
outstanding after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time
by reason of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, combination, exchange of
shares or the like, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
the effect of such change and, as so adjusted, shall from and after the date
of such event, be the Merger Consideration, subject to further adjustment in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 3.1(c)_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Parties to take any action except to
the extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this
Agreement.

 

3.2 _Treatment of Equity Compensation Awards_.

 

(a) _Time-Based Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding award of restricted Company Common Stock subject only
to time-based vesting (the " _Time-Based Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant
to the Companys 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time
(the " _Company Stock Plan_ "), shall immediately vest in full and any
forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Time-Based Restricted Stock shall
lapse immediately and, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, each share of Time-Based Restricted Stock shall
be treated as a share a share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this
Agreement, including the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms hereof, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such vesting.

(b) _Performance-Based Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted Company Common Stock
subject to performance-based vesting (the " _Performance-Based Restricted
Stock_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan shall (i) be deemed to
have satisfied any applicable continued service or time-based vesting
requirements and (ii) have the performance period end. The Companys
performance with respect to the performance goal(s) applicable to such
Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall be calculated based on actual
performance through the Effective Time, as reasonably determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board in order to determine the number
of shares of Performance-Based Restricted Stock that vest (the " _Earned
Performance-Based Restricted Stock_ ") and any forfeiture restrictions
applicable to such Earned Performance-Based Restricted Stock shall lapse
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, each share of Earned Performance-Based Restricted Stock
shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock for all purposes of this
Agreement, including the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms hereof, less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such vesting. The Company Board shall provide Parent
with an estimate of the number of shares of Earned Performance-Based
Restricted Stock that will vest pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_ at
least three Business Days prior to the Effective Time.

 



7 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall take such action and adopt
such resolutions as are required to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Time-
Based Restricted Stock and the Performance-Based Restricted Stock pursuant to
the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.2_, (ii) if requested by Parent in
writing, cause the Company Stock Plan to terminate at or prior to the

and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock
of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of any equity
awards of the Company, including any Time-Based Restricted Stock or
Performance-Based Restricted Stock; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_ shall prohibit the settlement of an award of
Performance-Based Restricted Stock after the Closing Date pursuant to the
terms of such award.

 

3.3 _Payment for Securities; Exchange_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent to act as
agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration and cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares, pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(h)_ to which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this
_Article III_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Eligible Shares, for issuance in accordance with this _Article III_
through the Exchange Agent, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable to in respect of Eligible Shares pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_.
Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_ and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued in exchange for Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_ and
_Sections_ _3.3(g)_ and _3.3(h)_ , the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Eligible Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent. To the extent, for any reason, the amount in the Exchange
Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate cash
payments contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ III_, Parent shall promptly
replace, restore or supplement the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for
the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate cash payments
contemplated by this _Article_ __ _ III_. Any interest or other income
resulting from investment of the cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable hereunder shall, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

 



8 (b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Eligible
Shares (" _Certificates_ "), a notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger and a letter of transmittal (" _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in a customary form
and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates for payment of the Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ Upon surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required by
the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such
holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_
and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

(ii) _Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each
record holder, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of
Eligible Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") not held
through DTC, (A) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (B) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (after
taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such
holder) and (C) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_
and dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

 

(iii) _DTC Book-Entry Shares_. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held
through DTC, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures
with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after
the Closing Date, upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or
its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures, the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, and any unpaid non-stock dividends and any other dividends or
other distributions, in each case, that DTC has the right to receive pursuant
to this _Article III_.

 



9 (iv) No interest shall be paid or accrued on any amount payable for
Eligible Shares pursuant to this _Article III_.

(v) With respect to Certificates, if payment of the Merger Consideration
(including any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) is to be
made to a Person other than the record holder of such Eligible Shares, it
shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. With respect to Book-Entry
Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration (including any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) shall only be made to the Person in
whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books
of the Company as of the Effective Time. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b_ _)(_ _v)_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

(c) _Termination of Rights_. All Merger Consideration (including any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_) paid upon the surrender of
and in exchange for Eligible Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation shall be closed immediately, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Eligible Shares previously represented by such Certificates,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_ and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, without any interest thereon.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the 180th
day after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
former common stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore
received the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.3(h)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock 

 



10  to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_, in each case
without interest thereon, to which they are entitled under this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent for
payment of their claim for such amounts.

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock
for any amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to the time that is immediately
prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by
such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(h)_
and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.3(g)_.

 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to_ _Unexchanged_ _Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to
receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder, in
each case until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(h) _No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock_. No certificates or
scrip or shares representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the

 



11  exchange of Eligible Shares and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Parent or a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Eligible Shares exchanged
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by (ii)
the volume weighted average price of Parent Common Stock for the five
consecutive trading days immediately prior to the Closing Date as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the
Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof. The payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of
the fractions in the exchange.

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable to any
holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement any amount required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so properly deducted or
withheld and paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority by the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such deducted or
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock to whom such amounts would
have been paid absent such deduction or withholding by the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

3.4 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Transactions.

14 (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement does
not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not (with or without

Engineers_ ") relating to the Company

Reserve Report_ ") or (ii) reflected in the Company Reserve Report or in the

positive differences in such percentage) and the applicable working interest
shown on the Company Reserve Report for such Oil and Gas Properties that are

Subsidiaries that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas
reserves attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Report
was, as of the time provided, accurate in all respects. Except for any such
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of the Company set forth in the Company Reserve Report are derived
from reports that have been prepared by the Company Independent Petroleum
Engineers, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil
and gas reserves of the Company at the dates indicated therein and are in
accordance with SEC guidelines applicable thereto applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods involved. Except for changes generally affecting
the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry (including
changes in commodity prices) and normal depletion by production, there has

title (as of the date hereof and as of the Closing) to each of the Oil and
Gas Properties held or owned by them (or purported to be held or owned by
them) (1) entitles Parent (or one or more of its Subsidiaries, as applicable)

that was material to such firms estimates of proved oil and gas reserves
attributable to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Reports was, as of the

individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of Parent
set forth in the Parent Reserve Reports are derived from reports that have
been prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve
estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of Parent
at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines
applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration,
development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices)

party operator) has violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any
act that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default under the provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor
thereunder to cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil
and Gas Properties owned or held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all proceeds from the sale
of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are being received by them in a timely manner and are not being
held in suspense (by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any third party
operator thereof or any other Person) for any reason other than awaiting
preparation and approval of division order title opinions for recently drilled
Wells.

 



42 (e) All of the Wells and all water, CO2, injection or other wells located
on the Oil and Gas Leases of Parent and its Subsidiaries or otherwise
associated with an Oil and Gas Property of Parent or its Subsidiaries have

applicable contracts entered into by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries related
to such wells and applicable Law, and all drilling and completion (and

Releases are reasonably likely to result in liability to Parent under
Environmental Law, and, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice asserting a liability
or obligation under any Environmental Laws with respect to the investigation,
remediation, removal, or monitoring of the Release of any Hazardous Materials

Approval, in response to a _bona fide_ written Company Competing Proposal from

remains a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Superior Proposal would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable; _provided_ , that in the event
of any material amendment or material modification to any Company Superior
Proposal (it being understood that any amendment or modification to the

such new written notice shall in no event shorten the original three (3)
Business Day notice period; and

 



58 (iv) prior to, but not after, receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
in response to a Company Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement and that did not arise from or in connection with a
breach of this Agreement by the Company, the Company may, if the
Company Board so chooses, effect a Company Change of Recommendation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such a Company Change of Recommendation may not
be made unless and until:

 

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that a Company Intervening Event
has occurred;

(B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that failure to effect a Company Change of

inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law;

(C) the Company provides Parent written notice of such proposed action and
the basis thereof three (3) Business Days in advance, which notice shall set
forth in writing that the Company Board intends to consider whether to take

(D) after giving such notice and prior to effecting such Company Change of
Recommendation, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation in response thereto; and

 

(E) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period, prior to taking action
to effect a Company Change of Recommendation, the Company Board takes into
account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent in writing and any other information offered by Parent in response
to the notice, and determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation in response to such Company Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that in the
event of any material changes regarding any Company Intervening Event, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)(iv) _with respect

Company shall not (and it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding any other provision in this  _Section_ __
_ 6.3_, prior to, but not after, the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, if, in response to an unsolicited request from a third party to
waive any "standstill" or similar provision, the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties owed by
the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law, the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar provision solely
to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Company Competing
Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board and communicate such
waiver to the applicable third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall advise Parent at least two Business Days prior to taking such
action. The Company represents and warrants to Parent that it has not taken
any action that (i) would be prohibited by this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(f)_ or
(ii) but for the ability to avoid actions inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company under

during the 30 days prior to the date of this Agreement.

any action, or failure to take action, that is taken by a director or officer

interest, inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a Parent Competing
Proposal made in writing provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
any such expression of interest, inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a
Parent Competing Proposal is not (or any portion thereof is not) made in
writing, a written summary of the material financial and other terms thereof.
Thereafter Parent shall (i) keep the Company 

 



60  reasonably informed of any material development regarding the status or
terms of any such expressions of interest, proposals or offers (including any
material amendments thereto) or material requests and shall reasonably
promptly apprise the Company of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company

but not after, receipt of Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to a Parent
Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement and
that did not arise from or in connection with a breach of this Agreement by

financial advisors and outside legal counsel that a Parent Intervening Event

and the basis thereof three (3) Business Days in advance, which notice shall
set forth in writing that Parent Board intends to consider whether to take

6.5 _Preparation of Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will promptly furnish to the Company such data and information
relating to it, its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and the holders of
its capital stock, as the Company may reasonably request for the purpose of
including such data and information in the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendments or supplements thereto used by the Company to obtain the adoption
by its stockholders of this Agreement. The Company will promptly furnish to
Parent such data and information relating to it, its Subsidiaries and the
holders of its capital stock, as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose
of including such data and information in the in the Joint Proxy Statement
and the Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto.

 

(b) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate in preparing and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cause to be filed with the SEC within twenty-one (21) days of the date of
this Agreement, (i) a mutually acceptable Joint Proxy Statement relating to
the matters to be submitted to the holders of

 



62  Company Common Stock at the Company Stockholders Meeting and the holders of
Parent Common Stock at the Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii) the
Registration Statement (of which the Joint Proxy Statement will be a part).
The Company and Parent shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC and to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff. Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become
effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as reasonably
practicable and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other promptly after it
receives any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or any
request by the SEC for additional information. Each of the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing the Registration Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent will (i) provide the other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii)
shall include in such document or response all comments reasonably and
promptly proposed by the other and (iii) shall not file or mail such document

or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. Each of the Company and
Parent will use reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 

(d) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement, so that such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company and Parent.

 



63 6.6 _Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Laws and the Organizational Documents of the Company to duly give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy
Statement by the SEC and the Registration Statement is declared effective by
the SEC (and in any event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such
meeting within 45 days thereof). Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.3_,
the Company Board shall recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting
and the Company Board shall solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and the Joint Proxy Statement
shall include the Company Board Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required to
adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the
Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders or (B) if, as
of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such
Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed
to a date that is more than ten (10) Business Days after the date for which
the meeting was previously scheduled ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that such
Company Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (_ _i_ _)(A)_ and _(_ _i_
_)(B)_ exist, and, with Parents consent, such Company Stockholders Meeting
may be adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the
foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and _provided_ _further_ that the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date on or after
two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date. If requested by Parent, the
Company shall promptly provide all voting tabulation reports relating to the
Company Stockholders Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the
Companys transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative, and shall
otherwise keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the status of the
solicitation and any material oral or written communications from or to the
Companys stockholders with respect thereto. Unless there has been a Company
Change of Recommendation in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the
Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against any efforts by any of the Companys stockholders or any other Person
to prevent the Company Stockholder Approval from being obtained. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law or its Organizational
Documents or in connection with a postponement or adjournment permitted
hereunder. Without the prior written consent of Parent or as required by
applicable Law, (i) the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter
(other than a non-binding advisory proposal regarding compensation that may
be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in
connection with the

 



64  Merger and matters of procedure) that the Company shall propose to be acted
on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Company shall not submit any other proposal to such stockholders in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise (including any
proposal inconsistent with the adoption of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Transactions) and (ii) the Company shall not call any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company other than the Company Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
Laws and the Organizational Documents of Parent to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Parent Stockholder Approval, to be held as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the clearance of the Joint Proxy Statement by the SEC
and the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC (and in any
event will use reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting within 45 days
thereof). Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Parent Board shall
recommend that the stockholders of Parent vote in favor of the issuance of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the Parent Board shall solicit
from stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of the Parent Stock Issuance,
and the Joint Proxy Statement shall include the Parent Board Recommendation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
(i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting
(A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Parents
stockholders or (B) if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders
Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct business at such Parent Stockholders Meeting and (ii) may adjourn or
postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient shares of
Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise
agreed to by the Parties, the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date that is more than ten (10) Business Days
after the date for which the meeting was previously scheduled (it being
understood that such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be adjourned or
postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing _clauses (_
_i_ _)(A)_  and _(_ _i_ _)(B)_ exist, and, with the Companys consent, such
Parent Stockholders Meeting may be adjourned or postponed every time the
circumstances described in the foregoing _clause (ii)_ exist); and _provided_
  _further_ that the Parent Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date on or after two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date.
If requested by the Company, Parent shall promptly provide all voting
tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting that have been
prepared by Parent or Parents transfer agent, proxy solicitor or other
Representative, and shall otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed
regarding the status of the solicitation and any material oral or written
communications from or to Parents stockholders with respect thereto. Unless
there has been a Parent Change of Recommendation in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts to defend against any efforts by any of the Parents stockholders
or any other Person to prevent the Parent Stockholder Approval from being
obtained. Once Parent has established a record date for the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Parent Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law
or its Organizational Documents or in connection with a postponement or
adjournment permitted hereunder.

 



65 (c) The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts
to set the record dates for and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the
Parent Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, on the same day.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing but subject to the
Companys ability to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)_, each of the Company and Parent agrees that its obligations to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as
applicable, pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not be affected by
the making of a Company Change of Recommendation or a Parent Change of
Recommendation, as applicable, and its obligations pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 6.6_ shall not be affected by the commencement, announcement,
disclosure, or communication to the Company or Parent, as applicable, of any
Company Competing Proposal or Parent Competing Proposal or other proposal
(including, in the case of the Company, a Company Superior Proposal) or the
occurrence or disclosure of any Company Intervening Event or Parent
Intervening Event.

 

(e) Within three (3) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take all necessary actions in accordance with applicable
Law, its Organizational Documents and the rules of the NYSE to duly postpone
the 2018 Annual Meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Annual Meeting_ ") and prior to the termination of this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, the Company shall not resume, hold or convene the Company Annual Meeting
or any other meeting of its stockholders other than the Company Stockholders
Meeting.

(f) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall duly
approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub in accordance with applicable Law and the Organizational Documents
of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent so approving and adopting this Agreement.

6.7 _Access to Information_.  

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 6.7_, the Company and Parent each shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to), upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement, or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions. The Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its
Representatives, during the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Section_ __ _
8.1_, reasonable access, at reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, to
the officers, key employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to their books,

 



66  records, contracts and documents and shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent and its Representatives
such information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties,
contracts, records and personnel as may be reasonably requested, from time to
time, by or on behalf of Parent. Parent and its Representatives shall conduct
any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise
cause any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(i) No Party shall be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to,
grant access or furnish information, as applicable, to the other Party or any
of its Representatives to the extent that such information is subject to an
attorney/client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine or that
such access or the furnishing of such information, as applicable, is
prohibited by applicable Law or an existing contract or agreement ( _provided_
, _however_ , the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall inform the other
Party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and
Parent shall reasonably cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements
to permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing
impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to
provide such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable
measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove
the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of appropriate clean
room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement
with respect to any information to be so provided, if the Parties determine
that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information
without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege);

 

(ii) No Party shall have access to personnel records of the other Party or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other information that in the other Partys good
faith opinion the disclosure of which could subject the other Party or any of
its Subsidiaries to risk of liability; 

(iii) Parent shall not be permitted to conduct any sampling or analysis of
any environmental media or building materials at any facility of the Company
or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company (granted
or withheld in its sole discretion); and

 

(iv) no investigation or information provided pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.7_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein.

 

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of March 21, 2018 between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information
furnished thereunder or hereunder; _provided_ , that Section 6 of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be of no force and effect as of the date
hereof. From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the

 



67  Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article_ __ _ VIII_, each Party shall continue to provide access to the
other Party and its Representatives to the electronic data room relating to
the Transactions maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other Party and
its Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

6.8 _HSR and Other Approvals_.

 

(a) Except for the filings and notifications made pursuant to Antitrust
Laws to which _Sections_ _6.8(b)_ and  _6.8(c)_ , and not this _Section_ __ _
6.8(a)_, shall apply, promptly following the execution of this Agreement, the
Parties shall proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental
Entities and other third parties all authorizations, consents, notifications,
certifications, registrations, declarations and filings that are necessary in
order to consummate the Transactions and shall diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Affiliates be required to pay any
consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any
such Persons authorization, approval, consent or waiver to effectuate the
Transactions, other than filing, recordation or similar fees. Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with
the Transactions (including the Joint Proxy Statement). The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with
respect to obtaining any consents, registrations, approvals, permits,
expirations of waiting periods or authorizations in connection with the
Transactions without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent, subject to _Sections_ _6.8(b)_ , may be withheld in Parents sole
discretion).

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement, the Parties shall make any filings required under the
HSR Act. As promptly as reasonably practicable, the Parties shall make the
filings and notifications as may be required by foreign competition laws and
merger regulations (the " _Competition Law Notifications_ "). Each of Parent
and the Company shall cooperate fully with each other and shall furnish to
the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filings under
any applicable Antitrust Laws. Unless otherwise agreed, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the prompt
expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or any
Competition Law Notifications. Parent and the Company shall each use its
reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply with any request for
information from any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying,
administering, or investigating the HSR Act, any Competition Law Notifications
or any other Law designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
purpose or effect of mergers, monopolization, restraining trade or abusing a
dominant position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "), including the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any
state of the United States, the European Commission or any other competition
authority of any jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ ").

 



68  Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from any Antitrust Authority. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Parent shall take any and all action necessary, including but not
limited to (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and
agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or
businesses of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii)
terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii) terminating any
venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship, contractual
rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each case, to
enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree or file
appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection with any
of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with respect to the Company
or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger) (each a " _Divestiture Action_
") to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any Law
or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, or to ensure that no Antitrust
Authority with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the
consummation of the Merger, fails to do so by the End Date;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take
or agree to take any Divestiture Action or other action that would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition or operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time (but, for purposes of
determining whether any effect is material, calculated as if Parent and its
Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time were collectively the same size
as Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), taken as a whole
(a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ "). Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_, in no event shall Parent have to take
or agree to take any Divestiture Action or other action (other than _de
minimis_ actions) with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (from and after the Effective
Time)). The Company shall agree to take any Divestiture Action requested by
Parent if such actions are only effective after the Effective Time and
conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions. In the event that any
Divestiture Action is proposed by or acceptable to a Governmental Entity,
Parent shall have the right to determine the manner in which to implement the
requirement of such Governmental Entity; _provided_ , that in no event shall
Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates) be required to take or effect any such action that is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _further_
, that Parent shall consult with the Company and give consideration to the
views of the Company on all matters relating to any possible Divestiture
Action. In the event that any action is threatened or instituted challenging
the Merger as violative of any Antitrust Law, Parent shall take such action,
including any Divestiture Action, as may be necessary to avoid, resist or
resolve such action ( _provided_ , that in no event shall this _Section_ __ _
6.8(b)_ require Parent to make or agree to take any Divestiture Action that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect). Parent shall be entitled to direct any
Proceedings with any Antitrust

 



69  Authority or other Person relating to any of the foregoing, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that it shall afford the Company a reasonable opportunity to
participate therein. In addition, subject to the terms of this _Section_ __ _
6.8_, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order
is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered in any Proceeding
that would make consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement unlawful or that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall take
promptly any and all steps necessary to vacate, modify or suspend such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the End Date.
The Parties shall take reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.8(b)_ so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall not take any action that could reasonably
be expected to hinder or delay in any material respect the obtaining of
clearance or the expiration of the required waiting period under the HSR Act,
any Competition Law Notifications or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause each individual who is employed as of the Closing Date by the Company
or a Subsidiary thereof (a " _Company Employee_ ") and who remains employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) to be provided with (i) base compensation (salary or
wages, as applicable), and as applicable, annual cash bonus and equity
compensation opportunities at target that are no less favorable, in each
respect, than those in effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (including retirement plan
participation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those in
effect for such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date through
the Company Plans. Parent shall also cause eligible Company Employees to be
provided with the benefits outlined in _Schedule 6.9(a)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter pursuant to the terms of such _Schedule 6.9(a)_.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take
commercially reasonable efforts to credit the Company Employees for purposes
of vesting, eligibility and benefit accrual under the Parent Plans (other than
with respect to any "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA, retiree medical benefits or disability benefits or to the extent it
would result in a duplication of benefits) in which the Company Employees
participate, for such Company Employees service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the same extent and for the same purposes that such
service was taken into account under a corresponding Company Plan immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give service credit for long term
disability coverage purposes for the Company Employees service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, as applicable, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to take
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any limitation on health and
welfare coverage of any Company Employee and his or

 



70  her eligible dependents due to pre-existing conditions and/or waiting
periods, active employment requirements and requirements to show evidence of
good health under the applicable health and welfare Parent Plan to the extent
such Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents are covered under an
a Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, and such conditions,
periods or requirements are satisfied or waived under such Company Plan and
(ii) give each Company Employee credit for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date for which payment has been
made, in each case, to the extent permitted by the applicable insurance plan
provider.

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to assume and honor their
respective obligations under the Companys Executive Change in Control and
Severance Benefit Plan.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, the
Company shall cause the Companys participation in the defined contribution
retirement plan in which the Company is a participating employer (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated, effective immediately prior
thereto. Prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), Parent
shall take any and all action as may be required, including amendments to the
tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan designated by Parent (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to (i) permit each Company Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in the form of cash in an amount equal to the
full account balance distributed or distributable to such Company Employee
from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, including any
outstanding loans. Each Company Employee shall become a participant in the
Parent 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date (giving effect to the service
crediting provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_); it being agreed that there
shall be no gap in participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution
plan. 

(f) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during the calendar year
in which the Closing occurs, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will assume and honor all unused vacation and other paid time off
days accrued or earned by such Company Employee as of the Closing Date for
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment to, or be
construed as amending, any Employee Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9 _are for the sole benefit of the
Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or will be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Company Employee or other current or former employee of the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates), other than the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns, any third-party
beneficiary, legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (including with
respect to the matters provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates (i) from amending or terminating any of their respective Employee
Benefit Plans or, after the Effective Time, any Company Plan in accordance
with their terms or (ii) after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any Company Employee.

  



71 6.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

(a) Without limiting any other rights that any Indemnified Person may have
pursuant to any employment agreement or indemnification agreement in effect
on the date hereof or otherwise, from the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who acts as a fiduciary
under any Company Plan, in each case, when acting in such capacity (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, fines,
penalties, expenses (including attorneys and other professionals fees and
expenses), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement,
of or incurred in connection with any threatened or actual Proceeding to which
such Indemnified Person is a party or is otherwise involved (including as a
witness) based, in whole or in part, on or arising, in whole or in part, out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, a fiduciary under any Company Plan or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, Employee Benefit Plan, trust or other
enterprise, as applicable, or by reason of anything done or not done by such
Person in any such capacity, whether pertaining to any act or omission
occurring or existing prior to or at, but not after, the Effective Time and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time ("
_Indemnified Liabilities_ "), including all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to,
this Agreement or the Transactions, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, jointly and severally, pay expenses incurred in connection therewith
in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to each Indemnified
Person to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting
the foregoing, in the event any such Proceeding is brought or threatened to
be brought against any Indemnified Persons (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified Persons may retain the Companys
regularly engaged legal counsel or other counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Persons as promptly as statements
therefor are received, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
use its best efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter. Any
Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, upon learning of any such Proceeding, shall
notify the Surviving Corporation (but the failure so to notify shall not
relieve a Party from any obligations that it may have under this _Section_ __
_ 6.10_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such Partys
position with respect to such claims). With respect to any determination of
whether any Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification by Parent or
Surviving Corporation under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, such Indemnified
Person shall have the right, as contemplated by the DGCL, to require that such
determination be made by special, independent legal counsel selected by the
Indemnified Person and approved by Parent or Surviving Corporation, as
applicable (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and
who has not otherwise performed material services for Parent, Surviving
Corporation or the Indemnified Person within the last three (3) years.

 



72 (b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any provision in the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation in any manner that would affect (or manage the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, with the intent to or in a manner that would)
adversely the rights thereunder or under the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of any Indemnified Person to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement except to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
fulfill and honor any indemnification, expense advancement or exculpation
agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its
directors or officers existing and in effect prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnified
Person against all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), such amounts to be payable in advance upon
request as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, relating to the enforcement
of such Indemnified Persons rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ or under
any charter, bylaw or contract regardless of whether such Indemnified Person
is ultimately determined to be entitled to indemnification hereunder or
thereunder.

 

(d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause to be put in place, and
Parent shall fully prepay immediately prior to the Effective Time, "tail"
insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ ") from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_")
in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing
policies with respect to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at
or prior to, but not after, the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall the aggregate cost of the DandO Insurance exceed during the
Tail Period 300% of the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company
for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assignees (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not sell, transfer, distribute or otherwise dispose of any of their
assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render Parent or
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy their obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Parties
and each Person entitled to indemnification or insurance coverage or expense
advancement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, and his heirs and
Representatives. The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this  _Section_
__ _ 6.10_ are in addition to any rights such Indemnified Persons may have
under the Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or under any applicable contracts or Law. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 



73 6.11 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event any Proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced or, to the knowledge of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened, that questions the validity
or legality of the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith,
including stockholder litigation (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company
or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other Party of such
Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed with
respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any Transaction
Litigation and shall consider in good faith Parents advice with respect to
such Transaction Litigation;  _provided_ , that the Company shall not offer
or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably
agreed upon by the Parties. No Party shall, and each will cause its
Representatives not to, issue any public announcements or make other public
disclosures regarding this Agreement or the Transactions, without the prior
written approval of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party,
its Subsidiaries or their Representatives may issue a public announcement or
other public disclosures (a) required by applicable Law, (b) required by the
rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or its Subsidiarys
capital stock is traded or (c) consistent with the final form of the joint
press release announcing the Merger and the investor presentation given
to investors on the morning of announcement of the Merger; _provided_ , in
each case, such Party uses reasonable best efforts to afford the other Party
an opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure and
provide reasonable comments thereon; and _provided_ , _however_ , that no
provision this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in any manner a Partys
ability to communicate with its employees ( _provided_ , that prior to making
any written communications to the directors, officers or employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication,
and the Company shall consider any timely comments in good faith) and that

and Material Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or future directors,

86 9.4 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the
execution of this Agreement and that it has executed the same with the advice
of said independent counsel. Each Party and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred
to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged between the
Parties shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not be
construed against any Party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that drafted it is of no
application and is hereby expressly waived.

 

(b) The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that
such information is required to be listed in the Company Disclosure Letter or
Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, that such items are material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as the case may be, or that such items have
resulted in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and Company Disclosure Letter are inserted for convenience
only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure Letter are
arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable, as an exception
to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately
disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or
warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on its face,
notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the
Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to such
other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto.

 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter
or Parent Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor
shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the Parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(d) All references in this Agreement to Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules,
Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the
corresponding Annexes, Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections
and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise.
Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or
other subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not

therein. The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and

specific time shall refer to Houston, Texas time. The word "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." The term "dollars" and the symbol "$" mean United States
Dollars. The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of

deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 

(e) In this Agreement, except as the context may otherwise require,
references to: (i) any agreement (including this Agreement), contract,

been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it
being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(together with the Confidentiality Agreement and any other documents and
instruments executed pursuant hereto) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,

OF DELAWARE OR THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT DETERMINES THAT, NOTWITHSTANDING

LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE SOLELY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE THAT

THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN RESPECT
OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO
ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR INTERPRETATION OR

AGREEMENT OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND
THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT ALL CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION,

EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (III) SUCH PARTY
MAKES THE FOREGOING WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or part hereof to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision
of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such other term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible. Except as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, in response to an order from a court or other competent authority
for any Party to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an
action consistent herewith or required hereby, to the extent that a Party
took an action inconsistent with this Agreement or failed to take action
consistent with this Agreement or required by this Agreement pursuant to such
order, such Party shall not incur any liability or obligation unless
such Party did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition
or entering of such order.

 

9.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in

9.10 _Affiliate Liability_. Each of the following is herein referred to as
a " _Company Affiliate_ "): (a) any direct or indirect holder of equity
interests or securities in the Company (whether stockholders or otherwise),
and (b) any director, officer, employee, Representative or agent of (i) the
Company or (ii) any Person who controls the Company. No Company Affiliate
shall have any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub of any nature
whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby other than for fraud, and Parent and Merger
Sub hereby waive and release all claims of any such liability and obligation,
other than for fraud. Each of the following is herein referred to as a "

hereby or thereby other than for fraud, and the Company hereby waive and
release all claims of any such liability and obligation, other than for fraud.

9.11 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached by the
Parties. Prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1_, it is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate form of specific
performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in each case in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 9.11_,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
the terms of this Agreement at law or in equity. Each Party accordingly agrees
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party
under this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _
9.11_. Each Party further agrees that no other Party or any other Person shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.11_, and each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. If prior to the End Date, any Party hereto brings an action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any
other Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action.

 

9.12 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the
Company, but, after any such adoption, no amendment shall be made which by law
would require the further approval by such stockholders without first
obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

9.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent may, to the extent legally allowed:

(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts
of the other Party hereunder;

(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other Party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or

 

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
Party contained herein.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
of any other right hereunder. No agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid unless set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such Party.
