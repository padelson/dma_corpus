(i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any of the parties hereto or the holders of any of the following
securities, other than as otherwise set forth in this _Section 2.7(b)_, each
share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Company Shares and any Dissenting
Company Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive the following consideration: (A) $1.20 in cash,
without interest (such per share cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Cash Consideration_ ") _plus_ (B) 0.2200 of a share of Parent Class A Common
Stock (such per share amount, as adjusted pursuant to  _Section 2.7(b)(ii)_,
being referred to herein as the " _Stock Consideration_ ") _plus_ (C) any cash

of any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration issuable
and payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Section 2.7(b)_ and any
dividends or other distributions issuable or payable in respect thereof
pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_ upon the surrender thereof in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 2.8_. The Merger Consideration issued upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.7(b)(iii)_ and _Section 2.8(c)_) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of

on the records of the Interim Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent, the

effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Parent Class
A Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to Parent Class A Common Stock having a record
date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (it being
understood and agreed that this clause (ii) shall not be deemed to amend or
modify in any respect the restrictions set forth in _Section 5.2_).

 



-18- (iii) No fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock will be issued by
virtue of the First Step Merger or pursuant to this Agreement, and in lieu
thereof each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock that
otherwise would be received by such holder of record) shall be entitled to
receive from Parent, upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s) (or the
receipt of an agents message in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in the manner
set forth in _Section 2.8_, an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole
cent), without interest, equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by
the closing price of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock on the trading
day ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, as
reported on the NYSE.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at

on the part of Parent, Merger Sub One, the Company, or the holders of any
shares of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or held in treasury of the
Company (collectively, " _Cancelled Company Shares_ "), in each case as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(c) _Dissenting Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a stockholder
who (A) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL, (B) properly complied with Section 262 of the DGCL, and (C) has
not effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (" _Dissenting
Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. By virtue
of the First Step Merger, all Dissenting Company Shares shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and shall represent the right to receive only those
rights provided under Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, all Dissenting Company Shares held by a
stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such stockholders right to appraisal under such Section 262
of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Certificate(s) (or receipt of an agents message in the case of Book-Entry
Shares) that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the
manner set forth in _Section 2.8_. The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt
notice of, together with copies of, any notice received by the Company of any
stockholders intent to exercise its appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL, demand received by the Company for payment of the fair value of any
Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
received by the Company which relate to any such demand for dissenters
rights and (y) the opportunity to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters rights under Delaware Law
in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal rights or settle or offer to settle or compromise
any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

 



-19- (d) _Stock Awards of the Company / Company ESPP_.

 

(i) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Award that is a
stock option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Company
Stock Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and is held by a Continuing Service Provider, whether or not then vested or
exercisable (each, an " _Assumed Option_ ") shall be assumed by Parent and
converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock, as provided herein. Each such Assumed Option shall be subject to
the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule
applicable thereto, except that (A) the number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock subject to such Assumed Option shall be equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down
to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock), and (B) the per
share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the per share exercise price at which such Assumed
Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Option Exchange Ratio (with the resulting price per share rounded up to the
nearest whole cent). It is the intention of the parties that each Assumed
Option that qualified as a United States-based incentive stock option (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall continue to so qualify, to the
maximum extent permissible, following the Effective Time, and further, that
the assumption of the Assumed Options shall be effected in a manner that
satisfies the requirements of Section 409A and 424(a) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and this _Section 2.7(d)(i)_
will be construed consistent with this intent. Each Company Stock Option that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Person
that is not a Continuing Service Provider shall not be assumed by Parent and
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two, the Company or the holder thereof,
shall be cancelled and shall have no further effect following the Effective
Time. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause each
Company Stock Option held by a Person that is not a Continuing Employee to be
cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, either pursuant to its
terms or pursuant to an agreement with the holder thereof.

 

(ii) _Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted
Stock Unit and each Company Performance Stock Unit that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Continuing Service
Provider and that is solely subject to time-based vesting, or with respect to
Company Performance Stock Units, that convert into awards as of the Effective
Time that are solely subject to time-based vesting following the Closing as
determined in accordance with Section 2.7(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, whether or not then vested or issuable (each, an "Assumed Unit"),
shall be assumed by Parent; provided, however, that each Assumed Unit shall
be converted into an award to receive that number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Unit immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, with the resulting
number rounded down to the nearest whole share of Parent Class A Common Stock.
Each Assumed Unit shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including as to vesting and issuance) as were applicable under the respective
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each
Company Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Performance Stock Unit that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by a Person
that is not a Continuing Service Provider shall not be assumed by Parent and
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two, the Company or the holder thereof, shall be
cancelled for no consideration and shall have no further effect following the
Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary
to cause each Company Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Performance
Stock Unit held by a Person that is not a Continuing Service

 



-20-  Provider to be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time, either
pursuant to its terms or pursuant to an agreement with the holder thereof. For
purposes of clarification, the number of Company Performance Stock Units that
will be considered Assumed Units will be calculated as set forth in Section
2.7(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter and all other Company Performance
Stock Units shall be cancelled for no consideration and shall have no further
effect following the Effective Time.

(iii) _Company ESPP_.

 

(A) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
such that the current offering in progress as of the date of this Agreement
shall be the final offering under the Company ESPP. If such offering has not
ended prior to the Effective Time, then, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (x) shall take all actions necessary such that a date to be
determined by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP
(but no later than the Effective Time) shall be the last day of such offering
and (y) shall make such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to
reflect the shortened and final offering but otherwise treating such
shortened and final offering as a fully effective and completed offering for
all purposes under the Company ESPP. In addition, effective as of the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary such that
(1) no new participant will be permitted to join the current offering in
progress under the Company ESPP and (2) no participant in the Company ESPP
with respect to the current offering shall be permitted to increase his or
her elections with respect to the current offering.

(B) Unless it has earlier terminated, the Company shall take all actions
necessary so that the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time. All amounts withheld by the Company on
behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to
purchase Company Common Stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be
returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP.

 

(C) The Company agrees to take any and all actions reasonably necessary to
approve and effectuate the foregoing provisions of this  _Section
2.7(d)(iii)_.

(iv) _Registration Statements for Assumed Options and Other Awards_. As soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten
(10) business days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 (and use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness thereof and maintain
the current status of the prospectuses contained therein) relating to shares
of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable with respect to the Assumed Options
and Assumed Units and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to remain in effect for so long as such Assumed Options
and Assumed Units remain outstanding.

of this _Article II_. All shares of Parent Class A Common Stock made available

Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than any
Cancelled Company Shares and any Dissenting Company Shares) pursuant to

Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_. At or prior to the

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within two (2) business days)
following the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub One and Merger Sub Two shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
that represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as of immediately

of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (x) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits in
lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.8(h)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the

-22-  practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on any cash amounts payable upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section
2.8_. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Book-Entry Shares

Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered (including as a
result of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that has
not been registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company), it

Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Law. To the extent that
such amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Interim Surviving
Corporation, the Surviving Company or any other party hereto shall be liable
to a holder of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock or Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At the request of Parent, any portion of
the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed or unclaimed on the date that is
six (6) months immediately following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore
surrendered Certificates in compliance with this _Section 2.8_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for issuance or payment of the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereto 

 



-23-  pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ and issuance and payment of any dividends or
other distributions payable or issuable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.8(c)_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed or unclaimed as of immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration that is issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.7(b)_ and any dividends or distributions issuable or payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_;  _provided, however_ , that
Parent and/or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owners of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Interim Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 

2.9 _Tax Treatment_ . The Merger is intended to constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties hereto intend
that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will constitute
integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of
reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement. No party hereto
shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to
fail to qualify, and each party hereto shall cause all Tax Returns relating
to the Merger to be filed on the basis of treating the Merger, as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including
filing the statement required by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a "final determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code.

2.10 _Taking of Necessary Further Action_ . If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Interim Surviving Corporation or
the Surviving Company with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger

and valid title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the tangible
properties and assets which it purports to own or lease, including all the
tangible properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet. All
tangible properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance Sheet are held
free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. The machinery,
equipment, furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal property and
assets owned, leased or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are, in
the aggregate, sufficient and adequate to carry on their respective businesses
in all material respects as conducted as of the date hereof, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries are in possession of and have good title to, or valid

equipment, furniture, fixtures and other tangible personal property and assets
that are material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, free
and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens.

3.12  _Intellectual Property_.

(a) _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and accurate list of all Patents or other Intellectual Property Rights that
are Registered Intellectual Property owned by or registered in the name of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively the " _Company Registered

(b) All Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights are owned or
exclusively licensed by the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries free
and clear of any Liens (excluding any non-exclusive licenses entered into in

Knowledge of the Company, all material Company Intellectual Property Rights
are, and following the transactions contemplated hereby shall be, valid and
enforceable and freely exercisable, transferable, licensable and 

 



-32-  alienable without the consent of, or notice or payment of any kind to any
Governmental Authority or third party. To the Companys Knowledge, no third
party claims to own or exclusively license any Company Intellectual Property
Rights, other than any Company Intellectual Property Rights that are
exclusively licensed to the Company and owned by the licensor. Since January

been sent or otherwise delivered regarding any actual, alleged, or suspected
infringement or misappropriation of any Company Intellectual Property
Right, including any invitation to license any third party Intellectual
Property Right.

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, in the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries infringed upon, violated or used without authorization or

Companys Knowledge, the Company and its Subsidiaries have sufficient rights
to all Intellectual Property Rights used in or necessary for the conduct of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective businesses as currently
conducted. There is no (and at no time within the three (3) years prior to
the date of this Agreement has there been any) pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened Action, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
alleging that any activity, product or the conduct of the Companys or any of
its Subsidiaries respective businesses infringes or will infringe upon,
violate or constitute the unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property Right
of any third Person, or challenging the ownership, validity, or
enforceability of any material Company Intellectual Property Right. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any settlement, covenant
not to sue, consent, decree, stipulation, judgment, or order resulting from
any suit, action or similar legal proceeding, or any other Contract, that (i)
materially restricts the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights to use,
license or transfer any material Company Intellectual Property Right, or (ii)
compels or requires the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to license or
transfer any material Company Intellectual Property Right. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of the infringement, misappropriation
or violation of any Company Intellectual Property Right.

(d) There is no pending Action before any court, Governmental Authority or

Disclosure Letter), the " _Company In Licenses_ "), excluding for the purpose
of the listing requirement on _Section 3.12(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (but not for purposes of the definition of Company In Licenses),

Affiliate: (i) any exclusive right or license to any Company Intellectual
Property Right, and (ii) any non-exclusive right or license to any material
Company Intellectual Property (those Contracts described in the preceding
clauses (i) or (ii), without reference to the Contracts set forth on _Section
3.12(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), the " _Company Out Licenses,_ "
and together with the Company In Licenses, the " _Company IP Licenses_ "),
excluding for the purpose of the listing requirement on _Section 3.12(f)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter (but not for purposes of the definition of
Company IP Licenses), non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of
business.

the Company, any other party to a Company IP License, is in material breach
of any Company IP License that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in or cause, under any Company
IP License that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries (or under any
other Contract entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
containing terms that, the Knowledge of the Company, would result in
or cause): (i) a third party to become licensed to, or otherwise have any
right (including any right or covenant of non-assertion) to, any Intellectual
Property Right owned by or licensed to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in
their capacity, after giving effect to the Merger, as an Affiliate of the
Company), (ii) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in their capacity, after
giving effect to the Merger, as an Affiliate of the Company) to become bound
by or made subject to any non-compete or other restriction on the operation
or scope of its businesses, or (iii) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (in
their capacity, after giving effect to the Merger, as an Affiliate of the
Company) to become obligated to pay any royalties or other amounts, or to
offer any discounts, to any third party in excess of those royalties or other
amounts payable or discounts offered by Company or any of its Subsidiaries
before the Closing.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed any
software under an Open Source License in a manner that would require any
material Technology that is owned by the Company or any Affiliate to (i) be
disclosed or distributed in source code form, (ii) be licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works, (iii) be redistributed, hosted or otherwise made
available at no or minimal charge, or (iv) be licensed, sold or otherwise made
available on terms that (A) limit in any manner the ability to charge license
fees or otherwise seek compensation in connection with the
marketing, licensing or distribution of that software or (B) grant the right
to decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise derive the source
code or underlying structure of that software. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all Open Source
Licenses to which they are subject (other than inadvertent omissions of any
applicable copyright notice, warranty obligation or attribution requirement).

 

(i) _Section 3.12(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and correct list of each standards setting organization, university or
industry body, consortium, or other multi-party special interest group in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is currently participating, or in
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has participated in the
past, including any of the foregoing that may be organized, funded,
sponsored, formed or operated, in whole or in part, by any Governmental
Authority (each, a " _SIG_ "). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has made any submission to, nor is subject to any agreement with, any SIG
that would obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in their capacity
as an Affiliate of the Company, or, after the Closing, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (in their capacity, after giving effect to the Merger, as an
Affiliate of the Company), to grant licenses to or otherwise impair or limit
its control of any Company Intellectual Property Right or any Parent
Intellectual Property Right.

but excluding non-disclosure agreements that do not grant to any party any
Intellectual Property Right (whether to or from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), and excluding Contracts for the sale of nominal numbers of
Company Products entered into in the ordinary course of business.

Law.

(l) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or has

are intended to be qualified under Section 501(a) of the Code (each, a "
_Company Qualified Plan_ "), have received determination, opinion or advisory
letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company
Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are
exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, or the Company has remaining a period of time under
applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or Internal Revenue

amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the qualified
status of each such Company Qualified Plan and to the Knowledge of the
Company, no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or exists since the date

affect the qualified status of any such Company Qualified Plan. Except as
would not result in any material Liability to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there has been no termination, partial
termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Company Qualified Plan

are not fully insured through an insurance contract.

(g) No Company Employee Plan provides post-termination benefits to former
employees of the Company or its ERISA Affiliates, other than pursuant to
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law. Neither the Company nor any of

(either individually or to employees as a group) or any other person that such
employee(s) or other person would be provided with post-termination benefits,
except to the extent required by applicable Law.

applicable jurisdiction. No such Company Non-U.S. Employee Plan has unfunded
liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or
fully accrued and, except as required by a Law, no condition exists that would
prevent the Company or Parent from terminating or amending any such Company
Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to the Company or
its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses or routine
claims for benefits). _Section 3.15(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a complete and accurate list of each country in which the

the Effective Time have been or will be timely made or are reflected on the
Company Balance Sheet.

 

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company (it being understood that for purposes of
this _Section 3.15(l)_, the definition of Knowledge shall be deemed to
include the Companys Senior Vice President of Human Resources), neither the
execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will, either alone or

becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any director, employee
or independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable
or required to be provided to any such director, employee or independent
contractor, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation.

(m) No amount paid or payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a
result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any
other event) could be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. No person is entitled to receive any additional
payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment from the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) as a result of the imposition of the excise taxes which
may be required pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code.

Parent, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each
Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock

extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) and has all requisite
corporate or other power and authority necessary to enable it to own, lease
and operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to conduct
its business as it is currently conducted, except to the extent that the
failure to be so organized or existing or in good standing or have such power
or authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of Parent is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction (to the extent such concepts exist in such
jurisdictions) where the character or location of the properties owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified
or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



-50- 4.6 _SEC Reports_. Parent has filed or furnished (as applicable) all forms,
reports, schedules, statements and other documents, including any exhibits
thereto, required to be filed or furnished (as applicable) by Parent with the
SEC since January 1, 2013 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). The
Parent SEC Reports, including all forms, reports and documents filed or
furnished (as applicable) by Parent with the SEC after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time, (i) were and, in the case of the Parent SEC
Reports filed or furnished (as applicable) after the date hereof, will be,
prepared in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as the case

amended, modified or superseded prior to the date of this Agreement by a later
filed Parent SEC Report, did not at the time they were filed or furnished (as
applicable) (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such filing), and in the case of such forms,
reports and documents filed or furnished (as applicable) by Parent with the
SEC after the date of this Agreement, will not as of the time they are filed
or furnished (as applicable), contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Parent SEC
Reports or necessary in order to make the statements in such Parent SEC
Reports, in light of the circumstances under which they were and will be made,
not misleading. None of the Subsidiaries of Parent is required to file or
furnished (as applicable) any forms, reports, schedules, statements or other
documents with the SEC. Since January 1, 2013, other than arising after the
date hereof from or relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Parent nor any Subsidiary of the
Parent has received from the SEC or any other Governmental Authority any
written comments or questions with respect to any of the SEC Reports

have been resolved but not publicly disclosed, or any notice from the SEC or
other Governmental Authority that such SEC Reports (including the financial
statements included therein) or registration statements are being reviewed or
investigated, and, to the Parents Knowledge, there is not, as of the date of
this Agreement, any investigation or review being conducted by the SEC or any
other Governmental Authority of any SEC Reports (including the financial
statements included therein). Parent maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in Parents
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated
and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of the principal
executive officer of Parent and the principal financial officer of Parent to
make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

(c) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has established and maintains,
adheres to and enforces a system of internal accounting controls over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange
Act) which are effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures that (i)
require the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the material transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that

statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of

statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by Parent and its
Subsidiaries or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents consolidated
financial statements.

 

(f) Since January 1, 2013, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any auditor, accountant or representative of

director or executive officer of Parent.

crime or the violation or possible violation of any applicable Law of the type
described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by Parent or any of its

ever owned any real property. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have good

which it purports to own or lease, including all the real properties reflected

Balance Sheet are held free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted
Liens. All real property leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy
agreements to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party (collectively, the " _Parent Real Property Leases_ ") are in full force
and effect, except where the failure of such Parent Real Property Leases to be
in full force and effect would not be reasonably likely to result in a
material and negative effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. There is no default by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under any of
the Parent Real Property Leases, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, defaults by
any other party thereto, except such defaults as have been waived in writing

Registered Intellectual Property owned by or registered in the name of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries are owned or exclusively licensed by Parent or one
or more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens (excluding any non-
exclusive licenses entered into in the ordinary course of business). To the
Knowledge of Parent, all material Parent Intellectual Property Rights are,
and following the transactions contemplated hereby shall be, valid and
enforceable and freely exercisable, transferable, licensable and alienable

jurisdiction, against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, alleging that any
activity, product or conduct of Parents or any of its Subsidiaries business
infringes or will infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use of
any Intellectual Property Right of any third Person, or challenging the
ownership, validity, or enforceability of any Parent Intellectual Property
Right. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any settlement,
covenant not to sue, consent, decree, stipulation, judgment, or order
resulting from any suit, action or similar legal proceeding, or any other
Contract, that (i) materially restricts Parents or any of its Subsidiaries
rights to use, license or transfer any material Parent Intellectual Property
Right, or (ii) compels or requires Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
license or transfer any material Parent Intellectual Property Right, except in
the case of this clause (ii) as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material and negative effect on Parent and

Property other than non-exclusive licenses granted in the ordinary course of
business (those Contracts listed in (i) or (ii), " _Parent Out Licenses_ ,"
and together with the Parent In Licenses, the " _Parent IP Licenses_ ").

 



-54- (f) To the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any other party to a Parent IP License, is in material breach of any
Parent IP License that is material to the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a material and negative effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed
any software under an Open Source License in a manner that would require any
software that is owned by Parent or any Affiliate to (i) be disclosed

they are subject (other than inadvertent omission of any applicable copyright
notice, warranty obligation or attribution requirement).

(h) _Section 4.12(h)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and correct list of each standards setting organization, university or
industry body, consortium, or other multi-party special interest group in

including any of the foregoing that may be organized, funded, sponsored,
formed or operated, in whole or in part, by any Governmental Authority (each,
a " _Parent SIG_ "). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any
submission to, nor is subject to any agreement with, any Parent SIG that would
obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to grant exclusive licenses to or
otherwise materially impair or materially limit its control of any material
Parent Intellectual Property Right.

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries (i) has incurred, or has any potential to incur, any liability
pursuant to any Tax sharing, Tax allocation or Tax indemnification Contract,
other than any such Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business
the primary purpose of which is unrelated to Taxes; or (ii) has any liability
for the Taxes of any Person other than Parent and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local
or non-United States law) as a transferee or successor, or otherwise by
operation of Law.

 



-57- (n) None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or has
Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning

4.15 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate of Parent has any plan
or commitment to establish any new material Parent Employee Plan, to
materially modify any Parent Employee Plan (except to the extent required by
law or to conform any such Parent Employee Plan to the requirements of any
applicable law, in each case as previously disclosed to the Company in
writing, or as required by this Agreement), or to adopt or enter into any
Parent Employee Plan.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, each Parent Employee Plan has been established, maintained
and administered in accordance with all applicable Law, including if
applicable, ERISA and the Code, and in accordance with its terms, and each of
Parent, Parents Subsidiaries and their respective ERISA Affiliates have met
their obligations with respect to each Parent Employee Plan and have timely
made (or timely will make) all required contributions thereto.

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, each of Parent, Parents Subsidiaries and their respective
ERISA Affiliates have complied in all respects with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in
respect of each such Parent Employee Plan, and has timely filed any and all
filings required under applicable Law in respect of each such Parent Employee
Plan.

 

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any material
Liability to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all
Parent Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code, and all trusts that are intended to be qualified under Section
501(a) of the Code (each, a " _Parent Qualified Plan_ "), have
received determination, opinion or advisory letters from the Internal Revenue
Service to the effect that such Parent Employee Plans are qualified and the
plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or Parent has
remaining a period of time under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury
regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for
such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable
determination as to the qualified status of each such Parent Qualified Plan
and to the Knowledge of Parent, no fact, circumstance or event has occurred or
exists since the date of such letter that would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent
Qualified Plan. Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any
material Liability to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there has
been no termination, partial termination or discontinuation of contributions
to any Parent Qualified Plan that resulted or may reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to Parent. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to result in any material Liability to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, no "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code or Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Parent Employee
Plan.

(e) Neither Parent, any of Parents Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has in the preceding six (6) years maintained, participated
in or contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to), or can reasonably
expect to have future liability with respect to (i) any employee benefit plan
which was ever subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (ii) a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (iii) a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iv) a "funded
welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. No Parent
Employee Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a "voluntary
employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code. No Parent Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not
fully insured through an insurance contract.

 



-58- (f) No Parent Employee Plan provides post-termination benefits to former
employees of Parent or its ERISA Affiliates, other than pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code or any similar Law. Neither Parent nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or
written form) to any employee of Parent or its ERISA Affiliates (either
individually or to employees as a group) or any other person that such
employee(s) or other person would be provided with post-termination benefits,
except to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(g) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration,
audit or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened or
reasonably anticipated, with respect to any Parent Employee Plan or the assets
of any Parent Employee Benefit Plan, other than claims for benefits in
the ordinary course.

(h) Each Parent Employee Plan maintained or covering employees outside the
United States (the " _Parent Non-U.S. Employee Plans_ "), and the books and
records thereof, is in material compliance with all applicable Law of each
applicable jurisdiction. No such Parent Non-U.S. Employee Plan has unfunded
liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance
or fully accrued and, except as required by a Law, no condition exists that
would prevent Parent or the Company from terminating or amending any such
Parent Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to
Parent or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses
or routine claims for benefits).

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, all contributions required to be made with respect to any
Parent Employee Plan on or prior to the Effective Time have been or will be
timely made or are reflected on the Parent Balance Sheet. 

(j) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger)
will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any
payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to
any director, employee or independent contractor of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or compensation
otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such director, employee
or independent contractor, or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of
payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation.

its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business conducted or presently
proposed to be conducted by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or relating to
the use of trade secrets or proprietary information of others, or (ii) in the

-73- _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval in the case of the
Company, or receipt of the Requisite Parent Stockholder Approval in the case
of Parent, (x) the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation

directors of such party has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and its outside
counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal with respect to such party, (B) such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from or arise out of a material breach or
violation of any provisions of _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_, _Section 6.3_
or _Section 6.4_ by the party proposing to take such action, and the Person
from whom such party received such Acquisition Proposal has not made any other
Acquisition Proposals (either alone or together with one or more other
Persons) to such party that resulted from or arose out of a material breach
or violation of any provisions of _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_, _Section
6.3_ or _Section 6.4_ by the party proposing to take such action, (C) the
party proposing to take such action has not materially breached or violated

Acquisition Proposals made by the same Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, whether alone or together with one or more other Persons), (D) prior
to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or Parent Board
Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the party proposing to take such
action shall have given the other party hereto at least five (5) business
days prior written notice of the intent to take such action (which notice

board of directors of the party proposing to take such action determines in

effect such Company Board Recommendation Change or a Parent Board
Recommendation Change, as the case may be, would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under Delaware Law (it being agreed that every subsequent
revision or modification to price or consideration of any other material
revision or material modification to any such Superior Proposal shall require
a new written notice thereof by the party proposing to take such action to the
other party, as the case may be, pursuant to the preceding clause (D) and a
new five (5) business day "matching" period under the preceding clauses (D)
and (E) following the initial five (5) business day "matching" period); or

 



-74- (ii) in response to an Intervening Event that has occurred after the date of
this Agreement, if: (A) the Intervening Event does not involve the receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, proposal, offer, or transaction from any
third party relating to or in connection with a transaction of the nature
described in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" (which, for the
purposes of this clause (A), shall be read without reference to the percentage
thresholds set forth in the definition thereof); and (B) (1) prior to
effecting the Company Board Recommendation Change or the Parent Board
Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the party proposing to take such
action shall have given the other party hereto at least five (5) business

by itself, constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or a Parent Board
Recommendation Change) and the opportunity to meet and discuss in good faith
the purported basis for the proposed Company Board Recommendation Change or
the Parent Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, the other partys
reaction thereto and potential amendments and modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in response thereto so that the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be effected, and (2) after
such discussions, the board of directors of the party proposing to take such
action determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that the failure to effect such Company Board Recommendation
Change or Parent Board Recommendation Change, as the case may be, would
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 

Each of the Company and Parent acknowledge and hereby agree that any Company
Board Recommendation Change or Parent Board Recommendation Change, as the
case may be, effected (or proposed to be effected) in response to or in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction may be
made solely and exclusively pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i)
only, and may not be made pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (ii),
and any Company Board Recommendation Change or Parent Board Recommendation
Change, as the case may be, may only be made pursuant to this _Section
6.4(b)_ and no other provisions of this Agreement.

Each of the Company and Parent, as applicable, shall keep confidential any
counter-offers or proposals made by the other party to revise the terms of
this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement or
to the extent required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports or under applicable
Law or stock exchange listing requirement.

(a) As promptly as practicable (but in any event no more than thirty-five (35)
days) after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, a Registration

Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing with the SEC. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause its respective representatives to, fully cooperate with

-78- (c) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be made without the
approval of Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided, however,_ that Parent, in
connection with a Parent Board Recommendation Change made in accordance with
terms of _Section 6.4(b)_, and the Company, in connection with a Company
Board Recommendation Change made in accordance with terms of  _Section

Registration Statement (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a
Qualifying Amendment to effect such change, and in such event, the right of
approval set forth in this _Section 7.3(c)_ shall apply only with respect to
such information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the right of each
party to have its board of directors deliberations and conclusions be
accurately described therein.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall cause the Registration Statement and
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as applicable, to comply in all material
respects as to form and substance with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
information supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement shall not, at the
time the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or declared effective
by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The information
supplied or to be supplied by either party hereto for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall not,
on the date the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) is first mailed to stockholders, at the time of each of
the Merger Stockholder Meetings, or as of the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. In addition, the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of either party hereto for inclusion in any filing pursuant
to Rule 165 and Rule 425 under the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the
Exchange Act (each, a " _Regulation M-A Filing_") shall not, at the time any
such Regulation M-A Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective
Time (i) the Company and Parent shall notify each other as promptly as
practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be
described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Registration Statement,
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing so that any
such document would not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and as promptly
as practicable thereafter, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company and/or Parent. The Company and Parent shall each notify the other as
promptly as practicable after the receipt by such party of any written or oral
comments of the SEC or its staff on, or of any written or oral request by the
SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to, the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any Regulation M-A Filing,
and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between
it or any of its representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to any
of the foregoing filings.

 



-79- (f) Each of the Company and Parent shall make any necessary filings with
respect to the Merger under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that such filings after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date (and, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Closing
Date, then on the date of such filing) will not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit (or will have omitted) to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. In addition, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take all
actions required under any applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky
Laws in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock
in the Merger.

Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and the
Requisite Parachute Vote in the case of the Company and the Parent Voting
Proposal in the case of Parent and unless the board of directors of either
party hereto shall effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in the
case of the Company or a Parent Board Recommendation Change in the case of
Parent, in each case, pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.4(b)_,
use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval in the case of the Company and the Requisite Parent Stockholder
Approval in the case of Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in connection
with its Merger Stockholder Meeting are solicited in compliance with the
DGCL, the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the case of the Company
and the rules of the NYSE in the case of Parent, the Company Certificate of

consultation with the other party hereto, may (and the other party may require
the Company or Parent to) adjourn or postpone its respective Merger
Stockholder Meeting if (and solely to the extent and for the minimum duration
reasonably necessary to ensure that) (i) any required supplement or amendment
to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to its respective
stockholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of its respective
Merger Stockholder Meeting, (ii) as of the time for which the applicable
Merger Stockholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus), there are insufficient shares of Company Common
Stock in the case of the

 



-80-  Company, or Parent Common Stock in the case of Parent, represented (either
in person or by proxy) at the respective Merger Stockholder meeting to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the respective
Merger Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , that any adjournment or postponement
pursuant to this clause (ii) shall not be to a date that is more than 45 days
after the originally scheduled Merger Stockholder Meeting; (iii) the Merger
Stockholder Meeting is required to be postponed or adjourned pursuant to
applicable Law, or (iv) the other party hereto has adjourned or postponed its

this Agreement and prior to the Merger Stockholder Meetings shall effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in the case of the Company or a Parent
Board Recommendation Change in the case of Parent, or (ii) any actual,
potential or purported Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has been
commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to the Company Board in the case
of the Company or the Parent Board in the case of Parent.

7.5 _Access; Notice and Consultation; Confidentiality_.

Subsidiaries to, afford the Parent and its Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours, to all of its personnel, properties, facilities,
contracts, books, records and other information concerning its business,

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to inform the Chief Financial
Officer of Parent at least one business days prior to the Closing of any
liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries as to which the Chief
Financial Officer of the Company has actual knowledge and that, individually,
would reasonably be expected to exceed $250,000 that were incurred (or as to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries became liable) outside the ordinary
course of business and that were not otherwise set forth in the Company SEC
Reports.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the Company

its Representatives a copy of each report, schedule, proxy or information
statement, registration statement and other document to be filed by it during
such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or
federal or state laws a reasonable period of time prior to the filing of such
reports, schedules, proxy or information statements, registration statements
and other documents, except no such prior notice shall be required in
connection with the public announcement of a Company Board Recommendation
Change effected pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.4(b)_ or in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal received by the Company to the extent
such disclosure is provided for in _Sections 6.4(c)_.

 



-81- (c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party hereto
upon becoming aware of any inaccuracy or breach of any agreement, covenant,
representation, or warranty contained in this Agreement if such inaccuracy or
breach would cause or would reasonably be expected to cause the condition in
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.3(a)_ (with respect to representations,
warranties, covenant and agreements of such party, as applicable), as the case
may be, and _Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ (with respect to
representations, warranties, covenant and agreements of such party, as
applicable), as the case may be, to fail to be satisfied at such time (as if
the Closing were to occur at such time) or at the Effective Time. No such
notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter
or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, for the purpose of
determining whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have
been satisfied.

 

(d) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery

Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other
communication received by such party or any of their respective Subsidiaries
from any Person, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time, alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (iii) any material written notice or written communication from
any Governmental Authority indicating that a Permit is revoked or about to be
revoked, which revocation or failure to obtain has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
Effect, as the case may be.

(e) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time
each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other party hereto,
orally and in writing, of any litigation commenced after the date hereof
against such party or any of its Representatives by any of its current or
former stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating
to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and shall keep the other party hereto reasonably informed regarding
any such litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall give the other party
hereto the opportunity to consult with such party regarding the defense or
settlement of any such stockholder litigation and shall consider the other
partys views with respect to such stockholder litigation. Neither the Company
nor Parent shall settle any such stockholder litigation without the prior
written consent of the other party.

(f) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Company shall cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis with
representatives of the other party and report the general status of the

or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to, or to
disclose information, where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any Law, fiduciary duty or Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable 

 



-82-  disclosure under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, no information obtained pursuant to the access granted or
notification provided pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ shall be deemed to (i)
amend or otherwise modify in any respect any representation or warranty of the
party providing such access or notice, (ii) impair or otherwise prejudice in
any manner rights of the party receiving such access or notice to rely upon
the conditions to the obligations of such party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) impair or otherwise limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such access or notice.

(h) All information acquired pursuant to the access granted or
notice provided pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ shall be subject to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 16, 2014
(with effect from August 10, 2014), between Parent and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
from and after the execution and delivery of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms.

 

7.6 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with
the other party hereto before issuing any press release or making any public
announcement or statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public announcement or statement
without the prior written consent of the other party hereto (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided,
however,_ that (i) a party may, without the prior consent of the other party
hereto, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement or
statement as may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq
Global Select Market as the case may be for the Company or the NYSE as the
case may be for Parent, if it first notifies and consults with the other
party hereto prior to issuing any such press release or making any such public
announcement or statement; and (ii) no such prior notice or consultation shall
be required in connection with the public announcement of a Company Board
Recommendation Change or a Parent Board Recommendation Change, as the case may
be, effected pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 6.4(b) _or in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal received by the Company or Parent,
to the extent such disclosure is provided for in _Section 6.4(c)_.

 



-83- 7.7 _Employee Plans_.

 

(a) _401(k) Plan_. The Company and its ERISA Affiliates, as applicable, shall
take all necessary actions to terminate (i) any and all group severance,
separation, deferred compensation, or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements, including but not limited to the Companys Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan (but excluding (i) the matters set forth on  _Schedule
5.2(g)_ , (ii) plans, programs or arrangements required by Law and (iii)
agreements entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and individual employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the

the Company 401(k) Plan (collectively, the " _Company Terminating Plans_ "),
in each case, effective as of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date
and contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of any resolutions or other corporate action (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, with
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
evidencing that the Company Terminating Plans will be terminated effective as
of the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, contingent upon the
consummation of the Merger. The Company shall also take such other actions in
further of terminating such Company Terminating Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require.

employee benefit plans, programs or policies (including vacation and
severance, but excluding the sabbatical program) of Parent or its Affiliates
in which Company Employees are eligible to participate following the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and vesting and determination of
level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals or benefit amounts
under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such recognition
would result in duplication of benefits). From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to, (i) cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting
periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company)
under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with
respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents, and (ii) provide
each Company Employee with credit for any deductibles paid under any Company
Employee Plan that provides medical, dental or vision benefits in the plan
year in effect as of the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out of pocket requirements under any medical, dental or vision plans of
Parent or the Surviving Company that such employees are eligible to
participate in after the Effective Time to the same extent that such expenses
were recognized under the comparable Company Employee Plan. The provisions of
this _Section 7.7(b)_ are not intended to confer upon any person other than
the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, and the parties
hereby expressly disclaim the creation or establishment of any third party
beneficiary rights (whether express or implied) under or by right of the terms
of this _Section 7.7(b)_. Nothing herein shall be deemed to amend any Parent
Employee Plan to reflect the terms of this _Section 7.7(b)_.

7.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_

 

(a) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement that have
been disclosed to Parent between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective current or former directors and officers and any
person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective
certificates of incorporation and

 



-84-  bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable
as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any respect except as and to the
extent required by applicable Law.

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain in
effect the existing policy of the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance (the " _D andO Policy_") covering claims arising from facts or events
that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the
extent that such acts or omissions are covered by the DandO Policy) and covering
each Indemnified Party who is covered as of the Effective Time by the DandO
Policy on terms with respect to coverage and amounts that are no less
favorable than those terms in effect on the date hereof; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Company be required to expend
in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium
paid by the Company (which annual premium is set forth on _Section 7.8(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter) for such insurance (such 250% amount, the "
_Maximum Annual Premium_ "), provided that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Company shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective
Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in lieu of
its obligations under this _Section 7.8(b)_, Parent or the Company may
purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Policy on terms and
conditions no less advantageous, in the aggregate, than the DandO Policy, and
in the event that Parent shall purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to, maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this _Section
7.9(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

(c) The obligations under this _Section 7.8_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 7.8(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Policy or
the "tail" policy referred to in  _Section 7.8(b)_ (and their heirs and
representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 7.8(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.8_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 7.8(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under
this _Section 7.8_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that such persons may have under the certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other
person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.8_.

 



-85- 7.9 _Listing of Shares of Parent Class A Common Stock_ Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have authorized for listing on the NYSE prior to
the Effective Time, upon official notice of issuance, the shares of Parent
Class A Common Stock issuable in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, the
shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all
Assumed Options and the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable in
respect of all Assumed Units.

 

7.10 _Takeover Statutes_ If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall promptly grant such approvals and take
such lawful actions as are necessary so that the Merger and/or such other
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, on the Merger and such other transactions.

 

7.11 _Section 16 Matters_ The Parent Board, or a committee thereof consisting
of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule
16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of the
Effective Time providing that the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Class
A Common Stock in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock, and of options
to purchase Parent Class A Common Stock upon assumption and conversion of the
Company Stock Awards, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the Section 16
Information, is intended to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act. In addition, the Company Board, or a committee thereof
consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution in advance of
the Effective Time providing that the disposition by Company Insiders of
Company Common Stock in exchange for shares of Parent Class A Common Stock,
and the disposition of their Company Stock Awards which will be deemed to
occur upon the assumption of those options and their resulting conversion
into options to purchase Parent Class A Common Stock, in each case pursuant
to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are
listed in the Section 16 Information, are also intended to be exempt pursuant
to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

7.12 _Tax Matters_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Tax opinions described in _Section 8.1(g)_
(collectively, the " _Tax Opinions_ "). Officers of Parent, Merger Sub One,

Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel to Parent, and Cooley
LLP, counsel to the Company, certificates containing customary representations
at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such law firms,
including the effective date of the Registration Statement and the Effective
Time, in connection with their respective deliveries of opinions with respect
to the Tax treatment of the Merger. Each such representation letter shall be
dated on or before the date of such Tax Opinion and shall not have been
withdrawn or modified in any material respect.

7.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub One and Merger Sub Two_. Parent shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two and the Surviving
Company to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (ii)
