AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of March 9,
2020, is entered into by and between United Community Banks, Inc., a Georgia
corporation ("Parent"), and Three Shores Bancorporation, Inc., a Florida
corporation (the "Company").



WITNESSETH:



WHEREAS, the parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the Company be merged with and into Parent (the
"Merger"), so that Parent is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Corporation");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the Merger
is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and has
unanimously adopted this Agreement and approved the execution, delivery, and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, has resolved to recommend that the shareholders of the Company
approve this Agreement and to submit this Agreement to the shareholders of the
Company (the "Company Shareholders") for approval;

WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be and is adopted as a
plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 354 and Section 361 of the
Code;

WHEREAS, as a material inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement,
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the directors,
executive officers, and certain shareholders of the Company, in their
respective capacities as shareholders, have entered into voting and support
agreements with Parent, effective as of the date hereof (each, a "Voting and
Support Agreement" and collectively, the "Voting and Support Agreements"); and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged,
the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:





ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Parent pursuant to
and with the effect provided in the Florida Business Corporation Act (the
"FBCA") and the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the "GBCC"). Parent shall
be the Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the State of Georgia. Upon consummation
of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease.

1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will occur by
electronic exchange of documents at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on a date which
shall be no later than three Business Days following the satisfaction or
waiver (where legally permissible) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature can
be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
all conditions at the Closing), unless extended by mutual agreement of the
parties (the "Closing Date").

1.3 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Florida (the "Florida Articles of Merger") and the articles of merger to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia (the "Georgia
Articles of Merger" and, together with the Florida Articles of Merger, the
"Articles of Merger") on the Closing Date. The "Effective Time" shall mean the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Florida
Articles of Merger and the Georgia Articles of Merger.

1.4 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the FBCA and the
GBCC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers, and
franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5 Conversion of Company Common Stock and Company Series D Preferred Stock.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company, or the holder of any of the following securities:



(a)Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of (i) common stock, no par value per
share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), (ii) convertible perpetual
preferred stock, no par value, Series D-1, of the Company ("Series D-1
Preferred Stock"), (iii) convertible perpetual preferred stock, no par value,
Series D-2, of the Company ("Series D-2 Preferred Stock"), (iv) convertible
perpetual preferred stock, no par value, Series D-3, of the Company ("Series
D-3 Preferred Stock"), (v) convertible perpetual preferred stock, no par
value, Series D-4, of the Company ("Series D-4 Preferred Stock" and, together
with Series D-1 Preferred Stock, Series D-2 Preferred Stock, and Series D-3
Preferred Stock, "Company Series D Preferred Stock"), in each case issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series D Preferred Stock owned by the Company
as treasury stock or owned by the Company or Parent (in each case other than
in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) and except for Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the
right to receive 0.3300 (the "Exchange Ratio") validly issued, fully paid, and
nonassessable shares (the "Merger Consideration") of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").



(b)All of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series D Preferred
Stock converted into the right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to this
Article 1 shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each,
a "Certificate," it being understood that any reference herein to
"Certificate" shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Series D Preferred Stock) previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Series D Preferred Stock shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive (i) a certificate representing the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Series D Preferred Stock have been converted into the right
to receive, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Series D Preferred Stock represented by such
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon, and (iii) any
dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates previously representing shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Series D Preferred Stock shall be exchanged
for certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock (together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such
Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If,
prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock,
Company Common Stock, or Company Series D Preferred Stock shall have been
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to
the Exchange Ratio.



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series D Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has properly exercised dissenters' rights in respect of such shares (such
shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such
time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holder's dissenters' rights under applicable law with respect to such shares)
in accordance with Sections 1301 through 1340 of the FBCA (the "Appraisal
Statutes") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of such consideration
as may be determined to be due in accordance with the Appraisal Statutes;
provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holder's right to dissent pursuant
to the Appraisal Statutes, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by the
Appraisal Statutes, such shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company Series
D Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.5(a), without interest thereon,
upon surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company Series D
Preferred Stock, as applicable. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal, of any withdrawals of such demands, and of any other documents or instruments
received by the Company related to the foregoing, and Parent shall direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to any such appraisal demands.



1.6 Parent Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Parent
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.



1.7 Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Follow-On Rights.



(a)At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under
the Three Shores Bancorporation, Inc. 2009 Incentive Plan or the Three Shores
Bancorporation, Inc. 2019 Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Company Equity
Plans") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Company Restricted Stock Award") shall vest and be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock
Award. The Surviving Corporation shall issue the consideration described in
this Section 1.7(a) (together with any accrued but unpaid dividends
corresponding to the Company Restricted Stock Awards that vest in accordance
with this Section 1.7(a)), less applicable tax withholdings, within five
Business Days following the Closing Date.



(b)Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to acquire
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Option" and hereinafter
sometimes referred to together with the Company Restricted Stock Awards as the
"Company Equity Awards") issued pursuant to the Company Equity Plans, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive a cash payment from the Company in an
amount (the "Option Cash-Out Amount") equal to the product of (i) the excess,
if any, of $10.00 over the exercise price of each such Company Option,
multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such option. The Option Cash-Out Amount payments shall be made by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time provided that the Company has received
an executed stock option cancellation agreement from the respective holder of
Company Options prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain such stock option cancellation agreements prior to the
Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, each such cancelled Company Option
shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only
entitle the holder to the payment of the Option Cash-Out Amount, without
interest. In the event the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to a Company Option is equal to or greater than $10.00, such Company
Option shall be cancelled without consideration and have no further force or
effect.

 (c)At the Effective Time, each right to make a follow-on investment with
respect to a share of Company Series D Preferred Stock existing under the
terms of the Purchase Agreements outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Follow-On Right") shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive a cash payment from Parent in an
amount (the "Follow-On Cash-Out Amount") equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of $10.00 over $6.47, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares
of Company Series D Preferred Stock subject to such Follow-On Right. After the
Effective Time, each such cancelled Follow-On Right shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle the holder to
the payment of the Follow-On Cash-Out Amount, without interest. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Purchase Agreements" has the meaning set forth in
that certain Conversion and Transaction Pricing Agreement, dated as of October
16, 2019, by and among the Company, PCAP-SNBT LLC, PCAP Associates-SNBT LLC,
JandR Founders-SNBT LLC, LM-SNBT LLC, and Continental Investors Fund LLC (the
"CTP Agreement").



(d)At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company or
the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
1.7.



1.8 Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. The Articles of
Incorporation of Parent in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.9 Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. The Bylaws of Parent in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



1.10 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors and
officers of Parent as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
continue to serve as the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
from and after the Effective Time.



1.11 Bank Merger. Immediately following the Merger, Seaside National Bank and
Trust, a national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company ("Company Bank"), shall merge (the "Bank Merger") with and into United
Community Bank, a Georgia state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("Parent Bank"). Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank
Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Company Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become
effective immediately following the Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be
implemented pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, in a form to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties (the "Bank Merger Agreement"). The Company
shall cause Company Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such
articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary
to cause the Bank Merger to become effective immediately following the
Effective Time.



 ARTICLE 2

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 Parent to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an
exchange agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, certificates or, at Parent's
option, evidence of shares in book-entry form (collectively referred to herein
as "certificates"), representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued to holders of Company Common Stock and Company Series D Preferred
Stock, and cash in leu of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for
shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, being hereafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), to
be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series D
Preferred Stock.



2.2 Exchange of Shares.



(a)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later
than five days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock and/or Company Series D Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article 1, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares, which the shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company
Series D Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as
well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b).
Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or
Certificates shall be entitled to receive promptly thereafter and in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock
and/or Company Series D Preferred Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to
the provisions of Article 1 and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A)
any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 2, and (B) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this Section 2.2, and
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock
and/or Company Series D Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate have
been converted into the right to receive, and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this
Section 2.2. 

(b)No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article 2. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article 2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series D
Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate had been converted into the
right to receive.



(c)If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition
of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than
that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered,
or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



(d)After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series D
Preferred Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such
shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares as provided in this Article 2.



(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each
former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to
the product of (i) the volume weighted average closing price on The NASDAQ
Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") of Parent Common Stock for the 20 full trading
days ending on the second trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
rounded to the nearest cent, multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent
Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 1.5.



(f)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders
of the Company for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation. Any former shareholder of the Company that has not
theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the shares of
Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each former share of Company Common Stock and/or Company Series D Preferred
Stock such former shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Series D Preferred Stock for any amount delivered in
good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.



(g)Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the
deduction and withholding was made.



(h)In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

of the Company have disclosed in their Tax Returns all information required by
the provisions of the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 6011 of the
Code with respect to any "reportable transaction" as that term is defined in
Section 6707A(c) of the Code.



(n)No gain recognition agreements have been entered into by either the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, and, except as set forth on Section 3.10(n)
of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has obtained a private letter ruling or closing agreements from
the IRS (or any comparable ruling from any other taxing authority).



(o)Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is or has at any time
been (i) a "controlled foreign corporation" as defined by Section 957 of the
Code; (ii) a "personal holding company" as that term has been defined from
time to time in Section 542 of the Code; (iii) a "passive foreign investment
company" nor has the Company or any Subsidiary at any time held directly,
indirectly, or constructively shares of any "passive foreign investment
company" as that term has been defined from time to time in Sections 1296 or
1297 of the Code.



(p)The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company is in full compliance in all
material respects with all the terms and conditions of any Tax exemption or
other Tax reduction agreement or order of a foreign or state government, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
have any adverse effect on the continued validity and effectiveness of any
such Tax exemption or other Tax reduction agreement or order.



(q)Except as set forth on Section 3.10(q) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in the payment of any amount for
which a deduction would be disallowed by reason of Sections 280G (as
determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4)) (or any corresponding
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law), 162 (other than 162(a)), or
404 of the Code.

 (r)To the Company's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the
Company has been, nor will any of them be, required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) ending after the day of the Effective Time (i)
pursuant to Sections 481 or 263A of the Code or any comparable provision under
state or foreign Tax Laws as a result of transactions, events, or accounting
methods employed prior to the Merger, (ii) as a result of any installment sale
or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iii)
as a result of any prepaid amount received on or prior to the day of the
Effective Time; (iv) as a result of an election under Section 108(i) of the

(s)The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects
with all applicable unclaimed property Laws. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company have
established and followed procedures to identify any unclaimed property and, to
the extent required by Applicable Law, remit such unclaimed property to the
applicable Governmental Authority. The Company's and each Subsidiary's records
are adequate to permit a Governmental Authority or other outside auditor to
confirm the foregoing representations.



(t)All transactions for taxable years for which the statute of limitations is
still open (including but not limited to sales of goods, loans, and provision
of services) between (i) the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and (ii)
any other Person that is controlled directly or indirectly by the Company
(within the meaning of Section 482 of the Code) were effected on arm's-length
terms and for fair market value consideration.



(u)The unpaid Taxes of the Company and each Subsidiary (i) did not, as of the
Balance Sheet Date exceed the reserve for Tax liability (other than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather than
in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past
custom and practice of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company in
filing its Tax Returns. Since the Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary of the Company has incurred any liability for Taxes arising
from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice.

owns at least a significant portion of its historic business assets, in each
case within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d).



(w)The Company has provided or made available to Parent all of the Company's
and its Subsidiaries' books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent

Company's Knowledge, the following information with respect to the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries as of the most recent practicable date and on an
estimated pro forma basis as of the Closing Date giving effect to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (i) the basis
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in its assets; (ii) the amount of any net
operating loss, net capital loss, unused investment or other credit, unused
foreign tax credit, or excess charitable contribution allocation to the
Company or its Subsidiaries; and (iii) the amount of any deferred gain or loss
allocation to the Company or its Subsidiaries arising out of any intercompany
transaction.



(y)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, nor
are they aware of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.



(z)As used in this Agreement, (i) the term "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal,
state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad valorem, profits,
gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, license, payroll, employment,
social security, severance, unemployment, withholding, duties, excise,
windfall profits, intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, value added,

claim for refund, or information return or statement relating to Taxes,
including any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment
thereof, supplied or required to be supplied to a Governmental Authority.

3.12 Employee Benefit Plans.



(a)Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true and
complete list of each plan, policy, agreement or arrangement (including
without limitation any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of

any other Governmental Authority within the past three years relating to any
Employee Benefit Plan (other than the documentation provided under (iii) and

Memorandum, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan: (i) such Employee
Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in compliance with
its terms and with all Applicable Laws, including, but not limited to, ERISA,

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder; (ii) no Proceedings are pending, or to the Company's

"prohibited transaction" or "reportable event" has occurred within the meaning
of the applicable provisions of ERISA or the Code.



(d)With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code, the IRS has issued a favorable determination
letter or opinion letter or advisory letter upon which the Company is entitled
to rely under IRS pronouncements, and no such determination letter, opinion
letter or advisory letter has been revoked nor, to the Company's Knowledge,
has revocation been threatened.



(e)All contributions (including, without limitation, all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions), premiums and
benefit payments required by and due from the Company and any Affiliate under
or in connection with the terms of each Employee Benefit Plan have been made

Code.

 (f)Each Employee Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated or otherwise modified
by the Company in its sole discretion, including the elimination of any and
all future benefit accruals thereunder, without any adverse consequences to
the Company, other than providing COBRA benefits to qualified beneficiaries of
any Employee Benefit Plan that is a group health plan. No communications or
provision of any Employee Benefit Plan has failed to effectively reserve the
right of the Company to so amend, terminate or otherwise modify such Employee
Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(f) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates has announced its
intention to modify or terminate any Employee Benefit Plan or adopt any
arrangement or program which, once established, would come within the
definition of an Employee Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(f)
of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, each asset held under each Employee
Benefit Plan may be liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any
redemption fee, surrender charge, comparable liability, or consent of a
Person, other than the Company or the trustee of such plan.



(g)Each Employee Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
been operated and maintained in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance thereunder. No stock option granted under any Employee
Benefit Plan (i) has an exercise price that has been or may be less than the
fair market value of the underlying stock as of the date such stock option was
granted, or (ii) has any feature for the deferral of compensation other than
the deferral of recognition of income until the later of exercise or
disposition of such option. No payment to be made under any Employee Benefit
Plan is or will be subject to the penalties or Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any Affiliate has any obligations to any employee or
other service provider to make any reimbursement or other payment with respect
to any Tax imposed under Section 409A of the Code.



(h)No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside
the United States.



(i)Except as set forth on Section 3.12(i) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, either
alone or in combination with any other event: (i) result in any payment
(including, without limitation, any separation, severance, termination,
retention, or similar payments or benefits) becoming due, or increase the
amount of compensation due, to any current or former employee, officer,
director or other individual of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company;
(ii) increase any benefits payable under any Employee Benefit Plan; or (iii)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
compensation or benefits. Further, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of
the Company has announced any type of plan or binding commitment to create any
additional Employee Benefit Plan, to enter into any agreement with any current
or former employee, officer, director, or other individual or to amend or
modify any existing Employee Benefit Plan or agreement with any current or
former employee, officer, director, or other individual.



(j)Except as set forth on Section 3.12(j) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company nor any
Employee Benefit Plan provides (or will provide) health or other welfare benefits to one or more former
employees, officers, directors, or other individuals (including dependents of
any of the foregoing) other than benefits that are required to be provided
pursuant to the applicable requirements of COBRA. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have at all times complied with COBRA, and have maintained
adequate records to evidence such compliance.



(k)No Employee Benefit Plan is, and neither the Company nor any Affiliate
thereof maintains or contributes to, or has at any time maintained or
contributed to, or has any liability, whether actual or contingent under, a
plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or to Section 412 of the
Code. No Employee Benefit Plan is or was at any time a multiemployer plan, as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any Affiliate
has ever contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute to, or incurred
any liability with respect to, any multiemployer plan. None of the Employee
Benefit Plans are part of, or have at any time been part of, a multiple
employer welfare arrangement, as that term is defined in ERISA Section 3(40).
No Employee Benefit Plan is or was at any time a multiple employer plan, as
described in Code Section 413(c) or ERISA Sections 4063 or 4064, and neither
the Company nor any Affiliate thereof has ever contributed to or had an
obligation to contribute to any such plan.



(l)Section 3.12(l) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a complete
list of all severance and termination benefits with respect to which the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has or will have any liability, under
any Employee Benefit Plan or other employment agreement, severance agreement,
program, practice, or arrangement.



(m)The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not require the funding (whether on a formal or informal basis) of the
benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan.



(n)No participants in any Employee Benefit Plan participate in such plan
pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.



(o)Except as set forth on Section 3.12(o) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, the 401(k) Plan is not funded with and does not allow for
payments, investments, or distributions in any employer security of the
Company or any Affiliate thereof (including employer securities as defined in
Section 407(d)(1) of ERISA), or employer real property as defined in Section
407(d)(2) of ERISA.



(p)Except as set forth on Section 3.12(p) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, no non-exempt reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA, and no event described in Sections 4062 or 4063 of ERISA, has
occurred in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan, and neither the Company
nor any Affiliate thereof has engaged in, or is a successor or parent
corporation to an entity that has engaged in, a transaction described in
Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.



(q)No Employee Benefit Plan which is an employee welfare benefit plan under
Section 3(1) of ERISA is funded by a trust or is subject to Code Sections 419
or 419A. 

(r)Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or is
otherwise obligated under, any plan, policy, agreement or arrangement that
provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes imposed under Sections
409A or 4999 of the Code (or any corresponding provisions of state or local
Law relating to Tax).



(s)Each Employee Benefit Plan that covers current or former employees
(including leased employees) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
satisfies the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(including any successor law) and the regulations and guidance issued
thereunder, such that there is no reasonable expectation that any Tax or
penalty could be imposed pursuant to such law that relates to such group
health plan. No condition exists that could cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to have any liability for any assessable payment
under Section 4980H of the Code. No event has occurred or condition exists
that could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to any
liability on account of a violation of the health care requirements of Part 6
or 7 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B or Section 4980D of the Code. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have maintained records that are
sufficient to satisfy the reporting requirements under Sections 6055 and 6056
of the Code, to the extent required, for all periods of time up to and through
the Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA
Affiliates has modified the employment or service terms of any employee or
service provider for the purpose of excluding such employee or service
provider from full-time status for purposes of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act.



(t)Each individual who is classified by the Company or any Subsidiary as an
independent contractor has been properly classified for purposes of
participation in, and benefit accrual under, each Employee Benefit Plan.

(f)any indenture, mortgage, promissory note, loan agreement, guarantee, sale
and leaseback agreement, capitalized lease or other agreement or commitment by

$150,000 in the aggregate and which by its terms does not terminate or is not

(i)any exclusive dealing or third-party referral agreement imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any Contract that contains express

or with any Person or in any area, or to solicit the business of any Person or
category of Persons;



(j)any Contract that grants any right of first refusal, right of first offer

that contains (i) any noncompetition or exclusive dealing agreement, or any
other agreement or obligation which purports to limit or restrict in any
respect the ability of the Company to solicit customers in the manner in which
or the localities in which, all or any portion of its business is conducted or
(ii) any agreement that grants any right of first refusal or right of first
offer or similar rights or that limits or purports to limit the ability of the
Company to own, operate, sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any
assets or business. All Material Contracts are valid and binding agreements of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and are in full force and
effect and are enforceable in accordance with their terms except as such
enforceability may be limited by the appointment of a conservator or receiver,
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
restructuring or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies
generally and general equitable principles regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation or breach of or default
under any Material Contract. To the Company's Knowledge, no third party is in
violation or breach of or default under any Material Contract, and there has
not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a breach or default.

 3.14 Title to Assets; Real Property.



(a)Except as set forth on Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement, the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has, and as of the Closing, the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries will have good and marketable title or a valid leasehold interest
in, easement or right to use all of its assets and properties, including those
reflected on the Balance Sheet as being owned or leased, as applicable (except
for assets sold or otherwise disposed of or leases that have expired since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business), and none of such
properties or assets is subject to any Liens other than Permitted Liens. All
such properties and assets are in good operating condition and repair,
ordinary wear and tear expected, and, in all material respects, are fit for
the uses to which they are being put.

(b)Section 3.14(b) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all real property owned by the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries other than "real estate owned" ("OREO") acquired as a result
of debts previously contracted or exercising remedies under loans held by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries and which are not used for the operations
of the Company (together with any buildings, structures, fixtures or other
improvements thereon, the "Owned Real Property"). The Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has, and as of the Closing will have, good, marketable and
insurable fee simple title interest in and to all Owned Real Property.



(c)Section 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all leases pursuant to which the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries is a lessee or lessor (the "Leases") of any real property
(together with any buildings, structures, fixtures or other improvements
thereon, the "Leased Property" and, together with the Owned Real Property, the
"Real Property"). All such Leases are valid, legally binding, in full force
and effect, and enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to the
appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general equitable
principles regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity. Other than as set forth on Section 3.14(c) of
the Company Disclosure Memorandum, there is not under any of the Leases: (i)
any default by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any circumstance which with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default; or (ii) to the
Company's Knowledge, any default or claim of default against any lessor to or
lessee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any event of default or event
which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by any
such lessor or lessee. The consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not result in a breach or default under any of the Leases, and,
except as set forth on Section 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum
and specifically identified as such, no consent of or notice to any third
party is required as a consequence thereof. The Company has made available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Leases, and no Lease has been
modified in any respect since the date it was made available. Except as set
forth on Section 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, none of the
property subject to a Lease is subject to any sublease, license or other
agreement granting to any Person any right to the use, occupancy or enjoyment
of such property or any portion thereof. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that the landlord with respect to any
real property lease would refuse to renew such lease upon expiration of the period thereof upon substantially the same terms,
except for rent increases consistent with past experience or market rentals.
There are no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened condemnation
proceedings against the Real Property.

any response or corrective action under any Environmental Law at any location;
and (v) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is party to any
agreement, Order, letter agreement, settlement agreement or memorandum of
agreement that imposes any obligations under any Environmental Law. Each of

accordance with customary loan policies approved by the Company's Board of
Directors, (iii) is evidenced by promissory notes or other evidences of
indebtedness, which are true, genuine and what they purport to be, and which,

their terms, (iv) is in full force and effect, and (v) to the Company's
Knowledge, is not subject to any offset, recoupment, adjustment or any other

insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, restructuring or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general equitable
principles regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity. None of the rights or remedies under the
documentation relating to the Loans has been amended, modified, waived,
subordinated or otherwise altered by the Company or its Subsidiaries, except
as evidenced by a written instrument which is a part of the file with respect
to such Loans made available to Parent and was entered into by the Company or
a Subsidiary in good faith and in its ordinary course of business. For
purposes of this Section 3.18(a), the phrase "enforceable in accordance with
its terms" as it relates to a Loan does not mean that the borrower has the
financial ability to repay a Loan or that any collateral is sufficient to
result in payment of the Loan secured thereby. (b) The Company and its Subsidiaries have previously disclosed a complete and
correct list of all Loans that, as of the Balance Sheet Date (i) are
contractually past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (ii) are on nonaccrual status or (iii) are classified as "Watch
List," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful" or "Loss," (or words of
similar import) together with the principal amount on each such Loan and the

Memorandum sets forth a complete list of other real estate owned, acquired by
foreclosure or by deed in-lieu thereof and owned by the Company or its

and practices of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been made
available to Parent.

(c) Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale or previously sold
to investors) has been solicited and originated and is administered and, where
applicable, serviced, and the relevant files are being maintained, in
accordance with the relevant loan documents in all material respects, the
Company's underwriting and servicing standards (and, in the case of Loans held
for resale or previously sold to investors, the underwriting standards, if
any, of the applicable investors) and with all Applicable Laws and applicable
requirements of any government-sponsored enterprise program. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have properly fulfilled in all material respects their
contractual responsibilities and duties with respect to any Loan in which they
act as the lead lender or servicer and have complied in all material respects
with their duties as required under applicable regulatory requirements.

(d) Except as set forth on Section 3.18(d) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, none of the agreements pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or
pools of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or interests
therein, other than repurchase obligations arising upon breach of
representations and warranties, covenants and other obligations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

loan files related to the Loans. Such files contain, in all material respects,
all of the documents and instruments relating to such Loans.

(f) All payments made on the Loans have been properly credited to the
respective Loan.

(g) As to each Loan that is secured, whether in whole or in part, by a
guaranty of the United States Small Business Administration or any other

remain in full force and effect following the Closing Date, in each case,
without any further action by the Company or its Subsidiaries' subject to the
Company fulfilling its obligations under the Small Business Administration
Agreement that arise after the date hereof.

(h) Section 3.18(h) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth a list of
all Loans by the Company and its Subsidiaries to any directors, executive
officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are defined in Regulation O
of the Federal Reserve (12 C.F.R. Part 215)) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no Loans to any employee, officer, director or other Affiliate of the Company on which the borrower is paying a
rate other than that reflected in the note or the relevant credit agreement.
All such Loans are and were made in compliance in all material respects with
all Applicable Laws. Each Loan disclosed on Section 3.18(h) of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum has been made in the ordinary course of business, and on
the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable arms'-length transactions, did not involve more than
the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

loan and lease losses and for credit losses shown on any financial statements
delivered in accordance with Section 6.12, as the case may be, were and will

and its Subsidiaries and were and will be in all material respects in
accordance with the requirements of GAAP.



3.21 Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments. Except as set forth on Section
3.21 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any interest rate swaps, caps, floors, derivative,
hedge, foreign exchange or currency purchase or sale agreements, option
agreements, futures and forward contracts or other similar derivative
transactions and risk management arrangements or agreements. All instruments,
agreements and arrangements set forth on Section 3.21 of the Company
Disclosure Memorandum were entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and in accordance in all material respects with
applicable rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory Agency and with
counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to the Enforceability
Exceptions), and are in full force and effect. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have duly performed in all material respects all of their
material obligations thereunder to the extent that such obligations to perform
have accrued, and, to the Company's Knowledge, there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party

3.22 Deposits. The deposit accounts of Company Bank are insured by the FDIC to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been duly, timely
and fully paid. All interest has been properly accrued on the deposit accounts

interest. Except as disclosed on Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum, the deposit accounts of Company Bank have been originated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the
respective governing documents and in compliance in all material respects with
all Applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor Company Bank has received written
notice of any loss or potential loss of any material business or customers
related to the deposit accounts of Company Bank. There is no action by the
FDIC to terminate Company Bank's deposit insurance and Company Bank has not
received any written claim or notice threatening action alleging any of the

in the Financial Statements and except to the extent any such securities are
pledged in the ordinary course of business consistent with prudent banking
practices to secure obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries.



3.24 Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC, and Customer
Information. The Company is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it
or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (a) to be operating in violation in
any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (b) not to be in satisfactory
compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy and customer
information requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and
regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the
provisions of the information security program adopted by the Company or
Company Bank pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364. The Company is not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would cause it to believe that any non-public
customer information or information technology networks controlled by and
material to the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner
that would cause it or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any material
remedial action. The Board of Directors of the Company (or, where appropriate,
the Board of Directors of any of the Company's Subsidiaries) has adopted and
implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and
appropriate customer identification verification procedures that comply with
Section 326 of the Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering program meets
the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act
and the regulations thereunder, and it (or such other of its Subsidiaries) has
complied in all material respects with any requirements to file reports and
other necessary documents as required by the Patriot Act and the regulations
thereunder.



3.25 CRA Compliance. Company Bank is "well capitalized" (as that term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. 325.103) and its most recent examination rating under the
Federal Community Reinvestment Act, as amended ("CRA"), was "satisfactory" or
better. To the Company's Knowledge, there is no fact or circumstance or set of
facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely to cause Company Bank
to receive any notice of non-compliance with such provisions of the CRA or
cause Company Bank's CRA rating to decrease below the "satisfactory" level.



3.26 Insurance. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries are insured against
such risks and in such amounts as are adequate and as the management of the
Company reasonably has determined to be prudent and customary with respect to
their businesses, properties and assets by insurers who are, to the Company's
Knowledge, of recognized financial responsibility. The Company maintains
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance. Section 3.26 of the Company Disclosure Memorandum sets forth (a) a list of all
insurance policies maintained with respect to the business and assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (b) all coverage limits, premiums and costs with
respect to such insurance policies, and (c) all claims made under such
insurance policies since December 31, 2016, the underlying incidents and dates
of such claims, the insurance proceeds recovered with respect to such claims,
the retention and deductibles with respect to such claims. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance coverage sought or
applied for and does not have any reason to believe that it will not be able
to renew existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or to
obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to continue
its business at a cost that would be materially higher than existing insurance
coverage. All insurance policies with respect to the business and assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, there has been
no lapse in coverage during the term of such policies, all premiums due and
payable thereon have been paid, the Company and its Affiliates have not
received notice to the effect that any of them are in default under any such
insurance policy, and all claims have been filed in a timely fashion. There is
no claim pending under any such policies with a respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as to which coverage has been denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies.



3.27 Fiduciary Activities.



(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has properly administered in all
material respects all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including
accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance
with the terms of the governing documents and applicable law. None of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer, or employee of any
of them has committed any material breach of trust or fiduciary duty with
respect to any such fiduciary account, and all the accountings for each such
fiduciary account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of
such fiduciary account, in each case in all material respects. All books and
records primarily related to the trust or wealth management businesses of the
Company and its Subsidiaries include documented risk profiles signed by each
customer. Since January 1, 2016, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been, and none are currently, engaged in any dispute with, or
subject to any claims by, any trust or wealth management customer for breach
of fiduciary duty or otherwise in connection with any such account.

(b) Each trust or wealth management customer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been in all material respects originated and serviced (a) in
conformity with the applicable policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(b) in accordance with the terms of any applicable contract governing the
relationship with such customer, (c) in accordance received from such customer
and its authorized representatives and authorized signers, (d) consistent with
such customer's risk profile, and (e) in compliance with all applicable laws
and the Company's and its Subsidiaries' constituent documents, including any
policies and procedures adopted thereunder. Each contract governing a
relationship with a trust or wealth management customer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and/or each such Subsidiary and, to the Company's Knowledge, the other
party(ies) thereto, each such contract constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the parties thereto (except as such enforceability may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions), and the Company, its Subsidiaries,
and the other party(ies) thereto have duly performed in all material respects their respective obligations
thereunder, and the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Company's
Knowledge, such other contracting parties are in compliance with each of the
terms thereof.

(c) No contract governing a relationship with a trust or wealth management
customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provides for any material
reduction of fees charged (or in compensation payable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries thereunder) by reason of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.28 Investment Advisory, Insurance and Broker-Dealer Matters.



(a) Section 3.29(a) of the Company Disclosure Memorandum lists each Subsidiary
of the Company (each, a "Company Advisory Entity") that provides investment
management, investment advisory or sub-advisory services to any Person
(including management and advice provided to separate accounts and
participation in wrap fee programs) and that is registered with the SEC as an
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment
Advisers Act"). Each Company Advisory Entity is registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act and has operated since January 1,
2016, and is currently operating, in compliance in all material respects with
all laws applicable to it or its business and has all registrations, permits,
licenses, exemptions, orders and approvals required for the operation of its
business or ownership of its properties and assets as presently conducted.
There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened, that would reasonably be expected to lead to
the revocation, amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension or
restriction of any such registrations, permits, licenses, exemptions, orders
and approvals.No Subsidiary of the Company conducts insurance operations that
require it to be registered with any state insurance regulatory authorities.No
Subsidiary of the Company is a broker-dealer or is required to register as a
"broker" or "dealer" in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Act or,
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls or has any
other association with (within the meaning of Article I of the Bylaws of
FINRA) any member firm of FINRA.

3.29 Brokers; Fairness Opinion. With the exception of the engagement of Piper
Sandler and Co. (the "Company Financial Advisor"), no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Bank Merger Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
the Company or Company Bank. The Company has disclosed to Parent as of the
date of this Agreement the aggregate fees provided for in connection with the
engagement of the Company Financial Advisor related to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including the Bank
Merger. The Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion of the
Company Financial Advisor to the effect that, as of the date hereof and based
upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Common Stock.

action required to be taken by them in order to exempt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby from the requirements of any "moratorium,"
"control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "shareholder protection," "anti-greenmail," "business

their respective Charter Documents concerning "business combination," "fair
price," "voting requirement," "constituency requirement," or other related
provisions.



3.31 Accuracy of Information. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
prospectus in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement, and the proxy statement of the Company relating to

asset or property of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Contract or
Permit of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) subject to receipt of
the Regulatory Approvals, constitute or result in a default under, or require
any consent pursuant to, any Law or Order applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets.



(c)Except for the Regulatory Approvals, no consents or approvals of or filings
or registrations with any Governmental Authority are necessary in connection
with the consummation by Parent of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



4.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
150,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock, of which, as of the date of this
Agreement, (i) 78,505,706 shares are issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares
are held in treasury, and (iii) 4,139,081 shares are reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options of Parent. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. The
Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange for Company Common Stock and
Company Series D Preferred Stock in the Merger, when issued in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, will be registered under the Securities Act and
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and will
not be subject to any preemptive rights. As of the date hereof there are, and
as of the Effective Time there will be, sufficient authorized and unissued
Parent Common Stock to enable Parent to issue the Merger Consideration as
contemplated in this Agreement.

 4.4 Regulatory Matters. Parent has timely filed all material reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
with respect thereto, that it was required to file since January 1, 2016 with
any Regulatory Agency, and has paid all applicable fees, premiums and
assessments due and payable thereto. Since January 1, 2016, each such report,
registration and statement, including financial statements, exhibits and
schedules thereto, complied, in all material respects, with Applicable Law. No
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority has initiated or has pending
or has advised Parent that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any formal enforcement action regarding the business, disclosures
or operations of Parent. There is no material unresolved written violation,
criticism, comment or exception by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Authority with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations
or inspections of Parent. Parent is not aware of any reason why it would not
receive all Regulatory Approvals on a timely basis without undue delay and
without the imposition of any Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.



4.5 Litigation; Orders.



(g) There is no material Proceeding pending or, to Parent's Knowledge,
threatened either (i) against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to which
any assets, interest, or right of any of them may be subject, or (ii) seeking
to prevent, materially alter or delay any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. To Parent's Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to or serve as a basis
for the commencement of any material Proceeding against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.



(h) There is no Order either (i) outstanding against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) seeking to prevent, materially alter or delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



4.6 SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Taxes.



(g) Parent has filed all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,
reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required to be
filed with the SEC by it under Section 5 of the Securities Act or Sections
13(a), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as the case may be, from and after
January 1, 2016 (collectively, the "Parent SEC Filings"). There is no
unresolved violation or exception of which Parent has been given notice by any
Governmental Authority with respect to any such report, statement or
certification. Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented if
applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date
of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became
effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As to their respective dates, all of the foregoing
reports complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules
and regulations of the Governmental Authority with jurisdiction thereof and
with respect thereto. There are no outstanding comments from or unresolved issues raised by the Governmental Authorities with respect to any of the
foregoing reports filed by Parent or its Subsidiaries.



(h) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including any notes
thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Filings, as amended, supplemented or
restated, if applicable, was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange
Act) on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated, and each of such
consolidated financial statements, as amended, supplemented or restated, if
applicable, presented fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Parent, at their dates and the results of operations and
changes in shareholders' equity of Parent for the periods indicated, and have
been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC and GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods covered thereby.



(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, nor are
they aware of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.



4.7 Brokers and Finders. With the exception of the engagement of Morgan
Stanley and Co. LLC, no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any
brokerage, finder's or other fee or commission in connection with this
Agreement, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries.



4.8 Accuracy of Information. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus on the date it (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) is first mailed to the Company Shareholders or at the time of the
Company Shareholders' Meeting, (b) the Registration Statement when filed with
the SEC and when it or any amendment thereto becomes effective under the
Securities Act, or (c) the documents and financial statements of Parent
incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration
Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by Parent
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement.

ARTICLE 6

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



6.1 Company Shareholders' Meeting.



(b) The Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable
laws and the Company's Charter Documents to duly give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of its shareholders (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting"), to
be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, for the purposes of obtaining the
Requisite Company Shareholder Vote. The Board of Directors of the Company has
resolved to recommend to the Company Shareholders that they approve this
Agreement and the Company shall, acting through its Board of Directors, (i)
recommend that the Company Shareholders adopt this Agreement (the "Company
Recommendation"), (ii) include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
Company Shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement,
including by communicating to the Company Shareholders the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of the Company that they approve this Agreement, and to
take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of
the Company Shareholders required by Applicable Law to obtain such approvals.
Except as permitted by Section 6.3(b), the Company's Board of Directors shall
not (A) fail to make the Company Recommendation or fail to include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (B) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw, or modify, or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw, or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, such
recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer, or (D) adopt, approve, or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the Company
Shareholders, an Acquisition Proposal (each of the actions described in these
subclauses (A)-(D) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with Article 8, the Company Shareholders'
Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company
Shareholders at the Company Shareholders' Meeting, for the purpose of voting
on the approval of this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of
such obligation.

6.2 Proxy and Registration Statement. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than 45 days
following the date of this Agreement), Parent and the Company shall prepare
the Registration Statement, which Parent shall file with the SEC and will
include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
such filing and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the Company Shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent
shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock and Company
Series D Preferred Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Parent will advise
the Company promptly after it receives oral or written notice of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration
Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the other with copies of any
written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders.



6.3 No Solicitation.



(a) The Company agrees that it will not, and will cause its directors,
officers, employees, advisors, representatives and Affiliates not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, or knowingly encourage or facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations concerning, or (iii) provide any confidential
or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with, any Person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, that, in the
event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
does not violate (i) and (ii) above at any time prior to, but not after, the
time this Agreement is adopted by the Requisite Company Shareholder Vote, and
the Company's Board of Directors concludes in good faith that there is a
reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and may
permit its officers and representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished
nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes
in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel) that failure
to take such actions would constitute, or would be reasonably likely to result
in, a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Company Shareholders under
applicable Law; provided further, that prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the
Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with such third
party on terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement. The
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with
any Persons other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) advise
Parent following the receipt or notice of any Acquisition Proposal and the
substance thereof (including the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Parent apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company's Board of Directors
concludes in good faith (and based upon the written advice of outside legal
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that failure to
accept such Superior Proposal would constitute, or would be reasonably likely
to result in, a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Company
Shareholders under applicable Law, the Company's Board of Directors may at any
time prior to the Requisite Company Shareholder Vote (i) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or make or cause to be made any third party or public
communication proposing or announcing an Adverse Recommendation Change, and
(ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of the Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change, and
terminate this Agreement, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal unless (i)
the Company shall not have breached this Section 6.3 in any respect and (ii)
(A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and its financial advisors) that such
Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be
a Superior Proposal after taking into account all adjustments to the terms of
this Agreement that may be offered by Parent under this Section 6.3(b); (B)
the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days' prior written notice
of its intention to take such actions set forth above (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal)) and has
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal; and (C)
before effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate in good faith with
Parent during such notice period to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material change to the terms of the such Superior Proposal, the Company shall,
in each case, be required to deliver to Parent a new written notice, the
notice period shall have recommenced and the Company shall be required to
comply with its obligations under this Section 6.3 with respect to such new
written notice. The Company will advise Parent in writing within twenty-four
(24) hours following the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance
thereof (including the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal) and will keep Parent apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis.

(c) As used in this Agreement, (i) the term "Acquisition Proposal" means any
bona fide proposal or offer for, inquiry relating to, or any third party
indication of interest in, whether in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, a (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange, tender offer,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company, (B) sale or
other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or any similar transaction, of any assets of
the Company representing 10% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company, (C) recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar type of transaction with respect to the Company, or (D)
transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, and (ii) the term "Superior Proposal" means any bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party, which, upon acceptance
by the Company, would create a legally binding obligation of such third party
(subject to regulatory approval) to consummate the Acquisition Proposal, on
terms that the Company's Board of Directors determines in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, (A) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not
less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Series D Preferred Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, and (B) would
result in a transaction that (1) involves consideration to the Company
Shareholders that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the
consideration to be paid to the Company Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration
being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated
with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond or in addition to those
specifically contemplated hereby, (2) is, in light of the other terms of such
proposal, more favorable to the Company Shareholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (3) is reasonably likely to
be completed on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal.

6.4 Regulatory Approvals and Filings.



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and Parent agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party
pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all
Regulatory Approvals and all other approvals necessary, proper or advisable
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and making all necessary, proper or advisable
registrations, filings and notices and taking all steps as may be necessary to
obtain an approval, waiver or exemption from any Governmental Authority;
provided, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Parent, or
require or permit the Company, to take any action, or commit to take any
action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining
the permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of any Governmental
Authority that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition");
(ii) obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications,
approvals, waivers or exemptions from nongovernmental Persons; and (iii)
executing and delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement (but in no event later than 45 days following
the date of this Agreement), Parent and the Company shall each prepare and
file any applications, notices and filings required in order to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals. Parent and the Company shall each use reasonable best
efforts to obtain each such approval as promptly as reasonably practicable.
The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection therewith (including
the furnishing of any information and any reasonable undertaking or
commitments that may be required to obtain the Regulatory Approvals). Each
party will provide the other with copies of any applications and all
correspondence relating thereto prior to filing, other than material filed in
connection therewith under a claim of confidentiality. If any Governmental
Authority shall require the modification of any of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement as a condition to granting the Regulatory Approvals, the
parties hereto will negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek a mutually agreeable adjustment to the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The parties shall advise each other within 24 hours of receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
the Regulatory Approvals or any other consent or approval required hereunder
will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed.

6.5 NASDAQ Listing of Additional Shares. Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable, file all documents (including a Notification of Listing of
Additional Shares), take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use
its reasonable best efforts to (a) list, prior to the Effective Time if such
listing is required to be made prior to the Effective Time under the NASDAQ

 6.6 Access; Systems Integration; Confidentiality.



(a) In order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the integration of the business and operations of the Company,
subject to Section 6.3(c) and Applicable Laws relating to confidentiality and
the exchange of information, the Company shall permit Parent and Parent's
Subsidiaries and their officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized Representatives, access, throughout the period before the Closing
Date, at Parent's sole expense, (i) during customary business hours, to the
Company's and its Subsidiaries' books, papers and records relating to the
assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities in which Parent
may have a reasonable interest; provided, however, that the Company shall not
be required to take any action that would provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would result in the waiver by it
of the privilege protecting communications between it and any of its counsel
or where such access or disclosure would contravene any Applicable Law or
Order or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement;
provided, further, that the parties shall attempt to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, and (ii) during and, as reasonably
required, outside of customary business hours, to telecommunications and
electronic data processing systems, facilities and personnel of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of performing conversion activities
related to data processing integration. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the Company's regular
business operations during any such access to the Company's property, books
and records.

(b) At the request of Parent, during the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall
cause their officers and employees to, make all reasonable efforts to cause
their respective telecommunications and data processing service providers to,
cooperate and assist Parent in connection with preparation for an electronic
and systematic conversion of all applicable data regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Parent's and Parent's Subsidiaries' systems of
telecommunications and electronic data processing, including, if requested by
Parent, by granting to Parent one or more powers of attorney authorizing
Parent to instruct or otherwise contact such telecommunications and data
processing service providers on the Company's behalf. Electronic and
systematic conversion shall occur at such time as determined by Parent, in its
sole discretion, provided, however, that no such conversion shall occur prior
to the Closing. Parent shall be responsible for reasonable and agreed upon
costs incurred by the Company, including all fees to third parties, in
connection with any such efforts.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of January 11, 2018, by and between Parent
and the Company Financial Advisor (the "Non-Disclosure Agreement") remains in
full force and effect and, in addition, covenants and agrees to keep
confidential, in accordance with the provisions of the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, information provided to them pursuant to this Agreement.

6.7 No Control of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 6.8 Press Releases. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or
filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to
issue, any such press release or make any such public statement without the
prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without
the prior written consent of the other party, issue such press release or make
such public statement or filing as may be required by Applicable Law or Order,
or any listing agreement with a national stock exchange or automated quotation
system; provided, further, however that such party shall have first used
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party with respect to such
release, statement or filing.



6.9 Employee Benefits.



(a) The Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the Three Shores Bancorporation, Inc. 401(k) Plan
(the "401(k) Plan"), unless Parent or one of Parent's Affiliates, in its sole
and absolute discretion, agrees to sponsor and maintain such 401(k) Plan by
providing the Company with written notice of such election at least 15 days
before the Closing. Unless Parent or one of its Affiliates provides such
notice to the Company, Parent shall receive from the Company, prior to the
Closing, evidence that the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted
resolutions to terminate the 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent), effective no
later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date. In the event that
the Company becomes aware prior to the Closing that distributions of assets
from the trust of the 401(k) Plan which is terminated is reasonably
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees to
be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such
terminated plan or upon the Company or other plan sponsor, then the Company
shall take (or cause to be taken) such actions as are necessary to reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Parent prior to the Closing. The Company shall take (or cause to be
taken) such commercially reasonable other actions in furtherance of
terminating the 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require. If Parent, in
its sole and absolute discretion, notifies the Company before the 15th day
prior to the Closing Date that Parent agrees to sponsor and maintain the
401(k) Plan, the Company shall amend the 401(k) Plan, effective as of the
Closing, to the extent permitted by its terms and applicable Law as necessary
to limit participation to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to
exclude all employees of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Company and
its Subsidiaries) from participation in such plan.

(b) Nothing in this Section 6.9, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 6.9. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of
this Section 6.9 will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current
or former employee, director or consultant of Company Bank in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in
this Section 6.9 is intended (i) to amend any Employee Benefit Plan or any
Parent Bank benefit plan, (ii) interfere with the right of either the Parent
or Parent Bank from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any
Employee Benefit Plan that is not terminated prior to the Effective Time or
amend or terminate any Parent Bank benefit plan, (iii) interfere with the
right of either Parent or the Parent Bank from and after the Effective Time to terminate the employment
or provision of services by any director, employee, independent contractor,
consultant or other service provider or (iv) interfere with Parent's
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 6.10.

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan of Parent or Parent Bank that is
a health, dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Company Bank
employee is eligible to participate following the Closing Date, Parent or its
applicable Subsidiary shall make reasonable efforts as are necessary or
appropriate to (i) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility
waiting periods under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect
to such Company Bank employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
such condition was or would have been covered under the Employee Benefit Plan
in which such Company Bank employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent permissible under Applicable Law,
recognize any health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by
such Company Bank employee or his or her covered dependents in the year that
includes the Closing Date for purposes of any applicable co-payment,
deductible or annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan.

(d) If any Company Bank employee is not hired by Parent or its Subsidiaries on
or immediately following the Effective Time or if prior to the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Company Bank employee is terminated by
Parent or its Subsidiaries other than "for cause," then Parent shall pay
severance to such Company Bank employee, subject to such Company Bank
employee's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in a
form satisfactory to Parent, in an amount equal to two weeks of base salary
for each twelve months of such Company Bank employee's prior employment with
the Company; provided, however, that in no event will the total amount of
severance for any single Company Bank employee be less than eight weeks of
such base salary nor greater than fifty-two weeks of such base salary;
provided, further, that any Company Bank employee so not hired by Parent or
its Subsidiaries or so terminated prior to the first anniversary of the
Effective Time and with 15 years or more of employment with Company Bank shall
be entitled to receive fifty-two weeks of such base salary.

(e) At the Effective Time, all accrued and unused sick time for all employees
of Company Bank and relating to periods prior to the Effective Time shall be
paid out to employees by the Company prior to the Effective Time.

(f) No later than thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall agree upon the names of the Company Bank
employees to whom Parent shall pay a stay bonus after the Closing and setting
forth the compensation to be paid to each such employee, which shall be in
addition to any severance payment to such employee otherwise provided pursuant
to Section 6.9(e) of this Agreement.

(g) Parent shall cause the continuation on and after the Effective Time and
through December 31, 2020 the incentive compensation bonus programs and
arrangements of Company Bank (excluding any equity-based programs and
arrangements) as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure
Memorandum (and any obligation for payments thereafter as a result of such
performance during calendar year 2020). (h) Parent or its Subsidiaries shall provide reimbursement for all COBRA
benefits for each Company Bank employee terminated by Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time other than
"for cause" in an amount up to four months for Company Bank employees with
fewer than 15 years of employment with Company Bank and six months for Company
Bank employees with employment with Company Bank of 15 years or longer.

6.10 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.



(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period of six years
thereafter, each of Parent and Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify and
hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or any time prior
to the Effective Time was, a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnitees") in respect of all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties costs and expenses
(including legal expenses) in connection with any claim, suit, action,
proceeding or investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising out of the
fact that Indemnitee was an officer, director or employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or acts or omissions by Indemnitee in such capacity or
taken at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at or any time
prior to the Effective Time (including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby), to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in the Company's Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of the Company's Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent,
from and after the Effective Time, shall and shall cause Surviving Corporation
to, advance any expenses (including legal expenses) of any Indemnitee under
this Section 6.10 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay advances if it shall be determined that such Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 6.10.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect for six years after the Effective Time, the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to such officers and directors so
long as substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
pursuant to this Section 6.10(b) more than an amount per year equal to 200% of
current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance and, in the
event the cost of such coverage shall exceed that amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. The
provisions of this Section 6.10 shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" policies with the same terms, conditions and coverage as
indicated above have been obtained by the Surviving Corporation for purposes
of this Section 6.10 from carriers with the same or better rating as the
carrier of such insurances as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
Representatives and is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any Indemnitee may have under the Company Charter Documents,
by contract or otherwise. In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or the purchaser of its assets and properties shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10. This Section 6.10 shall survive
the Effective Time.

6.11 Efforts to Close; Further Assurances.



(a) Parent and the Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to satisfy or
cause to be satisfied as soon as practicable their respective obligations
hereunder and the conditions precedent to the Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, each of the parties hereto shall promptly
advise the other party of any change or event that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause or constitute a breach in any
material respect of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein.

(c) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including
any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary
of the Company, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

6.12 Financial Statements. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date (or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8), the Company
will provide to Parent as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
the 20th day following the end of the relevant calendar month, the monthly
unaudited financial statements of the Company as provided to the Company's
management (including any related notes and schedules thereto), for each of
the calendar months ended after the date of this Agreement.



6.13 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent, on the other hand, shall promptly (and in any event within three
Business Days after becoming aware of any such breach) notify the other party
or parties in writing (a) if it believes that such party or parties have
breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or (b) if it believes that any event shall have occurred that might
reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
failure of a condition set forth in Article 7 if continuing on the Closing
Date.



6.14 Litigation and Claims. The Company shall promptly, and in any event
within two Business Days, notify Parent in writing of any Proceeding, or of
any claim, controversy or contingent liability that might reasonably be expected to become the subject of a
Proceeding, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, if such Proceeding
or potential Proceeding is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of
any Proceeding, pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that (a) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Parent or its
Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate at their own expense in the defense
or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors or Affiliates relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Parent's prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



6.15 Assumption of Company Subordinated Notes. At the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume the due and punctual payment of the principal and any premium and
interest on the Company's 5.875% Fixed to Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due
2026 in the aggregate principal amount of $15,000,000 (the "Company Notes") in
accordance with their terms, and the due and punctual performance of all
covenants and conditions thereof on the part of the Company to be performed or
observed after the Effective Time. In connection therewith, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver
any documents required to make such assumption effective as of the Effective
Time.



6.16 Payment of Loan Agreement Amount. On or before the Effective Time, the
Company shall pay in full all principal of and any premium and interest on
amounts owed by the Company pursuant to the certain Loan Agreement, dated
September 13, 2018, by and between the Company and First Tennessee Bank, N.A.
(now known as First Horizon Bank), and shall cause any related Liens on the
assets or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be released. The
proceeds of such payment shall be derived from a dividend from Company Bank
(subject to non-objection by any applicable Governmental Authority).

TERMINATION



8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

Parent and the Company if each of the Board of Directors of Parent and the
Board of Directors of the Company so determine by vote of a majority of the
members of its entire board; (b) (i) by Parent or the Company, if either of their respective Boards of
Directors so determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire
board, in the event that any Regulatory Approval shall have been denied by
final, non-appealable action by the applicable Governmental Authority or an
application therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a
Governmental Authority, or (ii) by Parent, if its Board of Directors so
determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire board, in the
event that Parent determines, in its good faith judgment, that obtaining a
Regulatory Approval would require a Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition
or the receipt of any Regulatory Approval would impose a Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition;

(c) by Parent or the Company (provided, that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph if it is in breach of its
obligations pursuant to Section 6.1 or Section 6.3), if the Requisite Company
Shareholder Vote is not obtained at the Company Shareholders' Meeting or at
any adjournment or postponement thereof;

(d) by either Parent or the Company (provided, that the terminating party is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the
covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any
such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent,
or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to
be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date,
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a
termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by the
Company, and which is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the
Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or to Parent, in the case of
a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured
during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination
Date);

(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before December 31, 2020 (the "Termination Date"), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to a material
breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement; and

(f) by Parent, if at any time prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting, (i)
the Company shall have materially breached its obligations under Section 6.1,
(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to make its
recommendation in favor of the Merger or shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change, (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
recommended, proposed, or publicly announced its intention to recommend or
propose, to engage in an Acquisition Proposal with any Person other than

materially breached its obligations under Section 6.1 by failing to call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders' Meeting in accordance
with Section 6.1; and

(g) by the Company pursuant to Section 6.3(b)(ii); and (h) by the Company in the event the Company so determines, at any time during
the five-day period commencing with the Determination Date (as defined below),
if both of the following conditions are satisfied:

(i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting
Price (each as defined below) (the "Parent Ratio") shall be less than 0.80;
and



(ii) (x) the Parent Ratio shall be less than (y) the number (the "Index
Ratio") obtained by (A) dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index
Price (each as defined below), and (B) subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in
clause (ii)(y)(A);



subject, however, to the following three sentences. If the Company elects to
exercise the termination right pursuant to this Section 6.1(h), the Company
shall give written notice to Parent not later than the end of the five-day
period referred to above (provided, that such notice of election to terminate
may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day period).
During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Parent
shall have the option to increase the consideration to be received by the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock hereunder, by
adjusting the Merger Consideration (calculated to the nearest one ten-
thousandth (1/10,000)) to equal the lesser of (x) the quotient (rounded to the
nearest one ten-thousandth (1/10,000)) of (A) the product of (1) the Starting
Price, multiplied by (2) 0.80, and further multiplied by (3) the Merger
Consideration (as then in effect), divided by (B) the Average Closing Price,
and (y) the quotient (rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth (1/10,000)) of
(A) the product of (1) the Index Ratio, multiplied by (2) the Merger
Consideration (as then in effect), divided by (B) the Parent Ratio. If Parent
so elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to
the Company of such election and the revised Merger Consideration, whereupon
no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.1(h), and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
Merger Consideration shall have been so modified).



For purposes of this Section 8.1(h), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:



"Average Closing Price" means the average of the VWAP of Parent Common Stock
during the ten consecutive full Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior
to the Determination Date.

"Determination Date" means the later of (i) the date on which the last
Regulatory Approval is obtained without regard to any requisite waiting period
or (ii) the date on which the Requisite Company Shareholder Vote is obtained.



"Final Index Price" means the average of the Index Prices for the ten
consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior to the Determination

consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day immediately preceding
the date of the first public announcement of entry into this Agreement.



"Starting Price" means $18.98.

that "Trading Day" shall not include any days on which trading on NASDAQ

If Parent or any company belonging in the Index Group declares or effects a
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement
and the Determination Date, the prices for the Parent Common Stock or the
common stock of such other company, as the case may be, shall be appropriately
adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.1(h).



8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination and abandonment of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become void and
have no effect, except that (a) the provisions of Section 6.6(c), Section 6.8,
this Section 8.2, Section 8.3, and Article 9 shall survive any such
termination and abandonment, and (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary

8.3 Termination Fee.



(a) In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities foregone
by Parent while pursuing the Merger, in the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(f);

(ii) (A) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company shall have been
communicated to or otherwise made known to the shareholders, senior management
or Board of Directors of the Company, or any Person or group of Persons shall
have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company after the date of this
Agreement, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (if the Requisite Company Shareholder Vote
has not theretofore been obtained), (2) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)
or (3) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and (C) prior to
the date that is 12 months after the date of such termination the Company
consummates a transaction of a type set forth in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" or enters into any definitive agreement relating to a
transaction of a type set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal";
or (iii) This Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g);

then, the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, a termination fee equal to $8,500,000 (the "Termination Fee")
within two Business Days following the date of such termination; provided,
that any Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.3(a)(ii) shall be paid
on the earlier of the date such transaction is consummated or such definitive
agreement is entered into.

(b) Parent and the Company each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts
due under this Section 8.3 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for such
amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment
of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate of interest
equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from time to time in
The Wall Street Journal (or any reasonably similar successor publication
thereto), designated therein as the "prime rate" on the date such payment was
due, plus (ii) 100 basis points, together with the costs and expenses of
Parent (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit.

(c) The payment of the Termination Fee shall fully discharge the Company from
and be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent with respect to any and all
losses that may be suffered by Parent based upon, resulting from or arising
out of the circumstances giving rise to the payment of such Termination Fee.
In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion.
