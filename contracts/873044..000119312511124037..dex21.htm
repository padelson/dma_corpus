Time Holders in a segregated client bank account and shall be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Holder Representative for, any third party expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) pursuant to this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Holder Representative Agreement. The Holder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Effective Time Holders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the Holder Representative Fund and the Effective Time Holders irrevocably transfer and
assign to the Holder Representative any ownership right that they may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in the Holder Representative Fund. The Effective Time Holders acknowledge that the Holder Representative is not providing any
investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The Holder Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Holder Representative Fund other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.
As soon as practicable following the later of the release in full of the Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account under the terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement and the resolution of all earn-out matters, the Holder
