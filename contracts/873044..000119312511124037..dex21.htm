ARTICLE 3

EFFECT OF MERGER; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

_Section 3.1_ _Merger Consideration_

(a) Conversion/Treatment of Company Capital Stock.

 

(i) _Outstanding Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Capital Stock issued and outstanding (other than shares of Company Capital
Stock to be cancelled in accordance with subsection (ii) hereof and any
Dissenting Shares) immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Purchaser, the Merger Sub,
the Company or the Stockholders, will be cancelled and extinguished, and each
such

 



24  share of Company Capital Stock will be converted into the right to receive
(1) at the Closing, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Closing Cash
Amount and such number of Purchaser Shares equal to the Per Share Closing
Stock Amount, (2) upon the release of any Escrow Shares or other property from
the Escrow Account to the Effective Time Holders, such number of Escrow Shares
equal to the Per Share Escrow Amount (plus a proportionate share of any other
property so released), (3) upon the payment of any Earn-Out Consideration, an
amount in cash equal to the Per Share Earn-Out Cash Amount, if any, or such
number of Purchaser Shares equal to the Per Share Earn-Out Stock Amount, if
any, (4) upon the payment of any Final Working Capital Payment Amount, an
amount in cash equal to the Per Share Working Capital Payment Amount, and (5)
upon release of any amount from the Holder Representative Fund, an amount in
cash equal to the Per Share Representative Fund Amount.

(ii) _Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Capital Stock that is owned by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be
cancelled and retired and will cease to exist and no Merger Consideration will
be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(iii) _Generally_. All Company Capital Stock, when so converted, will no
longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing such Company
Capital Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration represented by such certificate in
accordance with this _Article 3_.

(b) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Purchaser Share will be issued
by virtue of the Merger. Each Effective Time Holder who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a Purchaser Share (after aggregating all fractional
Purchaser Shares to be received by such holder) will receive from the Exchange
Agent on behalf of the Purchaser an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Per
Purchaser Share Value.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All Purchaser Shares
to be issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed issued and
outstanding, with respect to the Stock Merger Consideration, as of the
Effective Time and, with respect to any Purchaser Shares issued as Earn-Out
Consideration (the " _Earn-Out Shares_ "), as of the payment date of such
consideration, and whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by
the Purchaser in respect of the Purchaser Shares the record date for which is
at or after the Effective Time or at or after the payment date of the Earn-Out
Consideration, as applicable, that declaration shall include dividends
or other distributions in respect of the Stock Merger Consideration or Earn-
Out Shares, as applicable; _provided_ that the payment of any such dividends
or distributions shall be subject to _Section 3.3_.

 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, each
issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Merger Sub will be
converted into one validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) _Retention Plan Payments_. Promptly following the Closing, subject to
_Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.10_, the Purchaser shall cause the Exchange
Agent to distribute to each Retention Plan Participant in proportion to his
or her Retention Plan Interest (i) the Retention Plan Closing Cash Payment and
(ii) the Retention Plan Closing Stock Payment. Upon the release of any Escrow
Shares or other property from the Escrow Account, the Retention Plan Escrow
Shares (and a proportionate share of any other property so released) shall be
distributed by the Exchange Agent to each of the Retention Plan Participants
in accordance with each such participants Retention Plan Interest. Upon the
payment of any Earn-Out Consideration in cash, the Retention Plan Earn-Out
Cash Amount relating to such Earn-Out Consideration shall be distributed by
the Exchange Agent to each Retention Plan Participant in 

 



25  accordance with each such participants Retention Plan Interest. Upon the
payment of any Earn-Out Consideration in Purchaser Shares, the Retention Plan
Earn-Out Shares relating to such Earn-Out Consideration shall be distributed
by the Exchange Agent to each Retention Plan Participant in accordance with
each such participants Retention Plan Interest. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the aggregate value of cash and Purchaser Shares
(valued at the Per Purchaser Share Value) issued to Retention Plan
Participants under the Retention Plan shall not exceed the Retention Plan
Pool. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and after each
subsequent date on which cash is payable to the holders of Retention Plan
Interests), the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, or
the Escrow Agent, as applicable, shall pay to the holders of Retention Plan
Interests under this Agreement the cash amount to which each such holder is
entitled as of the Closing (or such later payment date), net of applicable
withholding Taxes. All Tax withholding obligations, if any, associated with
payment of any form of Merger Consideration other than cash to the holders of
Retention Plan Interests shall be satisfied by withholding in kind from the
applicable form of payment, whether such form is in Purchaser Shares, or other
property. Subject to _Sections 3.10_ and _10.3(g)_ , the Purchaser shall be
responsible for ensuring that applicable withholding Taxes are withheld and
deposited, and no holder of Retention Plan Interests or any other Effective
Time Holder will indemnify the Purchaser, or otherwise be responsible in
the event the Purchaser fails to withhold and deposit such Taxes, except that
a Retention Plan Participant whose Taxes were underwithheld (solely with
respect to the consideration paid to such Retention Plan Participant pursuant
to this  _Section 3.1(e)_) shall be responsible for such underwithheld Taxes
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

 _Section 3.2_ _Options and Other Rights to Acquire Company Capital Stock_

 

(a) _Vested Options_. The Company will take all actions necessary under the
Stock Option Plan and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the Common Stock
(including obtaining all necessary consents of current and former directors,
officers and employees of the Acquired Companies) so that each Vested Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancellation and subject to _Section 3.3_ and _Section 3.10_ hereof (i) at
the Closing, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Residual Cash Amount over the
exercise price of such Vested Option by (y) the number of shares subject to
such Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) at the
Closing, the number of Purchaser Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the Per Share Residual Stock Amount by (y) the number of
shares subject to such Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(iii) upon the release of any Escrow Shares or other property from the Escrow
Account, such number of Escrow Shares (and a proportionate share of any other
property so released) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Per Share Escrow Amount by (y) the number of shares subject to such Vested
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iv) upon the payment of any
cash Earn-Out Consideration, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the Per Share Earn-Out Cash Amount by (y) the number of
shares subject to such Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(v) upon the payment of any Earn-Out Consideration in Purchaser Shares, the
number of Purchaser Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the Per Share Earn-Out Stock Amount by (y) the number of shares subject to
such Vested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time; (vi) upon the
payment of any Final Working Capital Payment Amount, an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Per Share Working Capital
Payment Amount by (y) the number of shares subject to such Vested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (vii) upon the release of any
funds from the Holder Representative Fund, an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the Per Share Representative Fund Amount
by (y) the number of shares subject to such Vested Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and after
each subsequent date on which cash is payable to the holders of Vested
Options), the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, or the
Escrow Agent, as

 



26  applicable, shall pay to the holders of Vested Options under this Agreement
the cash amount to which each such holder is entitled as of the Closing (or
such later payment date), net of applicable withholding Taxes. All Tax
withholding obligations, if any, associated with payment of any form of Merger
Consideration other than cash to the holders of Vested Options shall be
satisfied by withholding in kind from the applicable form of payment, whether
such form is in Purchaser Shares, or other property. Subject to _Sections
3.10_ and _10.3(g)_ , the Purchaser shall be responsible for ensuring that
applicable withholding Taxes are withheld and deposited, and no holder of
Vested Options or Effective Time Holder will indemnify the Purchaser, or
otherwise be responsible in the event the Purchaser fails to withhold and
deposit such Taxes, except that a holder of Vested Options whose Taxes were
underwithheld (solely with respect to the consideration paid to such holder
pursuant to this _Section 3.2(a)_) shall be responsible for such
underwithheld Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Unvested Options_. Each Unvested Option held by a Continuing Employee
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be assumed as
of the Effective Time and converted by the Purchaser in accordance with
_Section 6.11_. As set forth in _Section 6.11_, the assumed Unvested
Options shall remain subject to the same vesting arrangements that were
applicable to such Unvested Options immediately prior to or at the Effective
Time.

(c) _No Other Rights; Further Actions_. Subject to the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 3.2_ (including _Section 3.2(b)_ relating to the assumption of
Unvested Options to the extent provided for therein), the Company will take
all actions necessary or appropriate by the Company so that at the Effective
Time, (i) all options, warrants, securities convertible into Company Capital
Stock and other rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Company Capital Stock
(in each case other than Preferred Stock that is convertible into Common
Stock) will be cancelled and any plan, program or arrangement providing for
the issuance or grant of any interest in respect of the Company Capital Stock
(other than the Stock Option Plan) will be terminated, _provided_ that any
such termination will comply in all material respects with the provisions of
Code Section 409A, where applicable, (ii) the holders of Company Capital
Stock and options, warrants or other rights to purchase the Company Capital
Stock will, on and after the Effective Time, have no right, title or interest
in or to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any securities of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation (other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as expressly provided herein), (iii) no Person holding
any securities of the Company will have any right to acquire any securities of
the Purchaser, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation by virtue of any
such securities of the Company or any act or omission of the Company or its
agents (other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as expressly
provided herein), and (iv) the Options will be treated as set forth in this
_Section 3.2_.

_Section 3.3_ _Exchange_  

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. The following exchange procedures will govern the
exchange of the Company Capital Stock and payments to holders of Vested
Options or Retention Plan Interests at or following the Effective Time:

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time but in no event later than two Business
Days thereafter, the Purchaser will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
Effective Time Holder (at their respective addresses as set forth in the list
provided pursuant to  _Section 6.23_) the following: (A) notice that the
Closing has occurred; and (B) a letter of transmittal substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , subject to such changes as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request (the " _Transmittal Letter_ "); _provided_ ,
that the Exchange Agent shall not be required to mail the foregoing to an
Effective Time Holder who has, with respect to each Stockholder, already
tendered its certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time

 



27  represented any Company Capital Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") (or has
otherwise complied with _Section 3.3(b)_) and, with respect to all Effective
Time Holders, a duly executed Transmittal Letter (collectively, the "
_Transmittal Documentation_ ") to the Exchange Agent at or prior to the
Closing. The Company may, at its discretion, permit some or all of the
Effective Time Holders to submit their Transmittal Documentation to the
Exchange Agent prior to Closing.

(ii) Upon surrender of the Transmittal Documentation to the Exchange Agent,
such Effective Time Holder will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor:
(A) one or more Purchaser Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such Person has the right to
receive pursuant to _Sections 3.1_ and _3.2_ (after taking into account all
shares of Company Capital Stock, all shares subject to Vested Options and
total Retention Plan Interest, as the case may be, then held by, or otherwise
applicable to, such Effective Time Holder), (B) cash in an aggregate amount
equal to the sum of (1) the share of the Cash Merger Consideration that
such Person has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, (2) the
share of the Closing Cash Option Spread that such Person has the right to
receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)_ and (3) the share of the Retention Plan
Closing Cash Payment that such Person has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.1(e)_ and (C) cash that such Person has the right to receive in
lieu of any fractional Purchaser Shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ (after taking
into account all shares of Company Capital Stock, all shares subject to Vested
Options and total Retention Plan Interest, as the case may be, then held by,
or otherwise applicable to, such Person), subject in all cases to any
required Tax withholding described in _Section 3.10_, and any surrendered
Certificate will immediately be cancelled.

 

(iii) Within two Business Days of receipt by the Exchange Agent of the duly
executed Transmittal Documentation (or, if such documentation has been
submitted to the Exchange Agent prior to the Effective Time, within two
Business Days following the Closing Date), the Purchaser will cause the
Exchange Agent to distribute to such tendering holder the portion of
the Merger Consideration distributable to such Person in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article 3_. The distributions of cash by the Exchange
Agent will be by check or, upon request of a tendering holder, wire transfer
of immediately available funds.

(iv) No interest will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to
the Effective Time Holders.

(b) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Purchaser may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate (i) to provide an affidavit of such loss, theft or
destruction in a form satisfactory to the Purchaser and any additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Purchaser, (ii) to indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as defined herein) from
and against any claim that may be made against the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and (iii) for any Certificate representing the right to receive more
than $5,000 in Merger Consideration at the Closing (with Purchaser Shares
being valued at the Per Purchaser Share Value), to provide a sufficient
indemnity bond in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser.

 

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. The provisions of this _Section 3.3_ will also apply
to Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the
obligations of the Purchaser under this _Section 3.3_ will commence on the
date of loss of such status and the holder of such shares will be entitled to
receive in exchange for such shares the Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ _3.1_.

 



28  The Company will furnish to the Purchaser in writing the names, addresses
and number and class of shares of Company Capital Stock held by any holders of
actual Dissenting Shares. Any portion of the Merger Consideration issued to
or deposited with the Exchange Agent or the Escrow Agent in respect of any
Final Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Purchaser upon demand.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid or payable or issued or issuable upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be deemed to be in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificates, and there will be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

_Section 3.4_  _Escheat_. If applicable, (a) any portion of the Closing Cash
Consideration or Closing Stock Consideration that remains undistributed by the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation to the Effective Time Holders as
of the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, (b) any portion of the
Escrow Fund held in the Escrow Account that remains undistributed as of the
date 180 days after the deposit by the Escrow Agent of such shares or other
consideration with the Exchange Agent, and (c) any portion of the Earn-Out
Consideration that remains undistributed as of the date 180 days after the
deposit of such Earn-Out Consideration with the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, shall be delivered to the Purchaser upon demand, and, thereafter,
each Effective Time Holder shall look only to the Purchaser for payment of
such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent will be liable
to any Effective Time Holder for any portion of the Merger Consideration
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

_Section 3.5_ _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
the holders appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL or
any successor provision and has not failed to perfect, withdrawn or otherwise
lost such holders right to appraisal and payment (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL,
becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment
therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall
have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares will
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which such holder is
entitled, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of the Certificate(s)
which formerly represented such former Dissenting Shares, in the manner
provided in _Section 3.3_. The Company will provide the Purchaser (a)
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Capital Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instrument served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the DGCL. The Company will not voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment, except with the
prior written consent of the Purchaser.

_Section 3.6_  _Working Capital Adjustment_

(a) No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
will prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a reasonably detailed written
calculation of the estimated amount of the Closing Net Working Capital (such
amount, the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_ "), prepared on an
estimated basis as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Statement_ ") and
certified by the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial
officer.

 



29 (b) The Closing Cash Consideration shall be increased or decreased as follows:

 

(i) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is a positive number, the
Closing Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount in cash equal to
60% of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital; and

(ii) if the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital is a negative number, the
Closing Cash Consideration shall be decreased by an amount in cash equal to
the absolute value of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(c) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will prepare and
deliver to the Holder Representative a statement (the " _Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement_ ") containing the Purchasers reasonably detailed
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital.

(d) Within five Business Days after the Closing Net Working Capital is finally
determined pursuant to _Section 3.8_ (the " _Final Closing Net Working
Capital_ "):

 

(i) if the Final Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Purchaser will pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Exchange Agent for subsequent distribution
to the Effective Time Holders an amount in cash equal to the amount by which
the Final Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment Amount (the " _Final Working Capital Payment Amount_ "); or

 

(ii) if the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount is greater than the
Final Closing Net Working Capital, the Purchaser will be entitled to a
disbursement of such number of Escrow Shares and other property from the
Escrow Account with a value (with such Escrow Shares included in such
disbursement valued at the Per Purchaser Share Value) equal to the amount by
which the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment Amount is greater than the
Final Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Final Net Working Capital Shortfall
Reimbursement Amount_ ").

 

(e) The Estimated Net Working Capital Statement, the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein
shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with GAAP (as in effect on the
date of this Agreement, and calculated in accordance with the procedures and
methodologies set forth on _Schedule II_ ) and, to the extent consistent with
GAAP, using the same accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies
and methods (with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions,
exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the
Acquired Companies in the preparation of the Interim Balance Sheet, except
that such statements, calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include
any purchase accounting or other accounting adjustment arising out of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
shall calculate any reserve, accrual or other non-cash expense item on a pro
rata (as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that
occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar month; and (iii)
shall include any adjustments specified on _Schedule II_. In addition, the
determination of Closing Net Working Capital contained in the Estimated Net
Working Capital Statement and the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement
shall be calculated for the actual Closing Date consistently with the
methodology and illustration provided in _Schedule II_ (which, for example
purposes only, is calculated as if the Closing Date was March 31, 2011)
and shall not include any additional line item not included in _Schedule II_.

 



30 (f) Any payment pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ will not preclude the
Purchaser from exercising any indemnification rights pursuant to _Article 10_
, except to the extent any such indemnification rights are expressly
superseded or waived by _Section 10.5(e)_. Any payment made pursuant to
this  _Section 3.6_ will be treated by the Parties for all purposes as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

 

 _Section 3.7_ _Earn-Out_. Subject to the limitations and qualifications set
forth in this _Section 3.7_ and in  _Section 10.3(g)_, the Purchaser shall
pay such additional amounts or issue such additional Purchaser Shares, as the
case may be, if any, as additional Merger Consideration as specified in this
_Section 3.7_.

 

(a) Within 45 days after the end of each three-month period during the period
commencing on the Earn-Out Commencement Date and ending on the earlier of (i)
the 36-month anniversary of the Earn-Out Commencement Date and (ii) the date,
if any, on which the Purchaser makes the $15,000,000 (subject to adjustments
described in the proviso contained in _Section 3.7(b)_) distribution to the
Exchange Agent described in the proviso contained in _Section 3.7(b)_ (the
period ending on such earlier date, the " _Earn-Out Period_ "), the Purchaser
shall prepare and deliver to the Holder Representative a written statement
certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Purchaser (each, an " _Earn-
Out Statement_ ") containing a reasonably detailed calculation of Qualifying
Royalty Revenues during the immediately preceding three-month period, which
shall include (A) the identification of revenues by: (1) customer name, (2)
contract number and date of contract, (3) description of customer designated
equipment, to the extent available, (4) units, (5) Specified Trillium Product
and (6) amount declared and (B) a list of royalty declarations due and
outstanding under the Trillium Contracts as of the end of the applicable
three-month period (a form of Earn-Out Statement is included in _Schedule VI_
for example purposes only); _provided_ , _however_ , that each Earn-Out
Statement delivered immediately following the 18-, 24- and 36-month
anniversaries of the Earn-Out Commencement Date (each such staggered
18-month, six-month and 12-month period following the Earn-Out Commencement
Date being referred to as a " _Qualifying Royalty Revenue Period_ ") shall
contain a reasonably detailed calculation of Qualifying Royalty Revenues
during the immediately preceding Qualifying Royalty Revenue Period and a
description of any withholding by the Purchaser of any Setoff Amount in
accordance with _Section 10.3(g)_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Qualifying Royalty Revenues_ " means an amount equal to royalty revenues of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (or any successor, transferee
or licensee under _Section 3.7(e)_), as determined by application of the
revenue recognition methodologies and other procedures set forth on _Schedule
VI_, to the extent generated from Specified Trillium Products under the
Trillium Contracts. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Trillium Contracts_ "
means:

(i) written Contracts set forth on _Schedule VI_ on the date hereof; 

(ii) written Contracts for Specified Trillium Products actually entered into
between the date hereof and the Closing Date in the Ordinary Course on terms
that are materially consistent with the written Contracts set forth on
_Schedule VI_ as of the date hereof with counterparties identified on
_Schedule VII_ following approval by Michel Dagenais, such written Contracts
to be set forth prior to Closing on an update to _Schedule VI_ ;

(iii) written Contracts for Specified Trillium Products that are actually
entered between the Closing Date and the three month anniversary of the
Closing Date in the Ordinary Course with counterparties identified on
_Schedule VII_ following approval by Michel Dagenais and Brian Bronson
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and which
approval shall be deemed to reflect full compliance with this clause (iii)),
such written Contracts to be set forth on an update to _Schedule VI_ ;

 



31 (iv) any Contract deemed a "Trillium Contract" by application of  _Section
3.7(c)(iii)(E)_; and

(v) any amendments of any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Subject to _Section 10.3(g)_, the Purchaser shall, within five Business
Days following determination of the final, conclusive and binding amount of
Qualifying Royalty Revenues in accordance with _Section 3.8_ for any
Qualifying Royalty Revenue Period, pay to the Exchange Agent for subsequent
distribution to the Effective Time Holders an amount in cash equal to the
Qualifying Royalty Revenues for such Qualifying Royalty Revenue Period (less
the Per Share Earn-Out Cash Amount that would be payable in respect of any
Final Dissenting Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that in lieu of making any
and all such payments under this _Section 3.7_, at any time prior to the
fifth Business Day following the determination of the final, conclusive and
binding amount of the Qualifying Royalty Revenues for the Qualifying Royalty
Revenue Period ending on the 18-month anniversary of the Earn-Out
Commencement Date, the Purchaser may, subject to _Section 10.3(g)_, pay cash
or, if the Share Issuance Requirements are met, issue Purchaser Shares in such
proportions as the Purchaser shall determine in its sole discretion with a
combined aggregate value of $15,000,000 (based on the Per Purchaser Share
Value to the extent Purchaser Shares are issued) (less the applicable Per
Share Earn-Out Cash Amount and the applicable Per Share Earn-Out Stock Amount
that would be payable or issuable in respect of any Final Dissenting Shares)
to the Exchange Agent for subsequent distribution to the Effective Time
Holders.

 

(c) Until the end of the Earn-Out Period, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to, (i) comply in all
respects with its obligations under the Trillium Contracts, except for
immaterial actions or omissions of non-compliance that would not reasonably be
expected to cause any reduction or delay in payment of any of the
Qualifying Royalty Revenues arising under the applicable Trillium Contract,
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to timely obtain applicable royalty
declarations, (iii) not amend, waive any right under or terminate any Trillium
Contract in any manner that would reasonably be expected to reduce or delay
the payment of the Qualifying Royalty Revenues arising thereunder without the
prior written consent of the Holder Representative (unless (A) the other party
to such Trillium Contract is in material breach and has failed to cure such
breach within 30 days after notice thereof, (B) the Purchaser provides prior
written notice of any such breach and failure to cure to the Holder
Representative at least ten Business Days prior to taking any such action,
(C) such breach involves the infringement, misappropriation or use in excess
of licensed rights of or with respect to any Company Intellectual Property,
(D) any amendment to the applicable Trillium Contract, or the Trillium
Contract as so amended, remains a "Trillium Contract" for all purposes of this
Agreement and is set forth on _Schedule VI_, (E) to the extent the applicable
Trillium Contract is terminated, any Contract entered into thereafter between
the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries and the counterparty to such
terminated Trillium Contract or any of its Affiliates relating to any
Specified Trillium Product is deemed a "Trillium Contract" for all
purposes of this Agreement and is set forth on _Schedule VI_, and (F) the
primary purpose of such amendment, waiver or termination is other than to
avoid paying Qualifying Royalty Revenues), (iv) not assign any Trillium
Contract in whole or in part (other than in connection with a transaction
described in, and in accordance with, _Section 3.7(e))_, (v) not enter into
any Contract with a counterparty to any Trillium Contract or any of its
Affiliates that permits any offset, reduction, deduction or withholding to be
taken by such counterparty under the applicable Trillium Contract with such
counterparty that would reduce Qualifying Royalty Revenues, (vi) not
accelerate the payment of any amount that would constitute Qualifying Royalty
Revenues in exchange for a reduced payment or otherwise "buy-down" any amount
that would constitute Qualifying Royalty Revenues, and (vii) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to finalize and execute written Contracts
that

 



32  satisfy clause (iii) of the definition of Trillium Contracts in _Section
3.7(a)_ prior to the three month anniversary of the Closing Date. In addition,
until the end of the Earn-Out Period, the Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to satisfy its
obligations set forth in clauses (i) through (vii) above.

 

(d) Any payments and issuances of Purchaser Shares made pursuant to this
_Section 3.7_ shall be treated for all purposes as adjustments to the Merger
Consideration.

(e) The Purchaser agrees that in the case of a sale or transfer of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Surviving Corporation (including in
each case, by way of exclusive license) or in the event of a sale of stock,
merger, consolidation, other business combination or similar transaction
involving the Surviving Corporation (but excluding any change of control of
the Purchaser), pursuant to which a Person or "group" (as defined in the
Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of Persons would acquire
50% or more of the voting power of the Surviving Corporation, the party
acquiring such assets, license or stock, or otherwise engaging with the
Surviving Corporation in such merger, consolidation, other business
combination or similar transaction, as the case may be, shall assume
in writing all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in
this Agreement remaining in effect at the time of consummation of such
transaction, if any, including the obligations set forth in this _Section
3.7_; _provided, however_ , that, in the case of any of the aforementioned
transactions, the Purchaser shall guarantee the acquiring partys obligations.
Purchaser shall provide copies of the documents whereby such party assumes in
writing such obligations and Purchaser provides such guarantee to Holder
Representative within 15 days following the consummation of the applicable
transaction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Surviving
Corporation may transfer any Trillium Contracts, or any rights related
thereto, to any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that a transfer
referred to in this sentence shall be permitted only if, as a precondition to
such transfer, the transferee executes a joinder to this Agreement pursuant
to which such transferee agrees to be bound by all of the terms of this
Agreement with respect to such Trillium Contracts or rights, and the Purchaser
guarantees the transferees obligations. Purchaser shall provide copies
of the joinder documents and such guarantee to the Holder Representative
within 15 days following the consummation of the applicable transfer.

_Section 3.8_ _Resolution of Calculation Disagreements_

(a) Following the delivery of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement
in accordance with _Section 3.6_ and each Earn-Out Statement delivered
immediately following the 18-, 24- and 36-month anniversaries of the Earn-Out
Commencement Date, the Holder Representative will have the right, exercisable
at its sole discretion, to audit the information included or required to be
included in any such Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or in any
Earn-Out Statements covering the applicable Qualifying Royalty Revenue
Period, as the case may be. Each of the Holder Representative and the
Purchaser shall have reasonable access (including electronic access to
documents in formats such as Excel spreadsheets, or searchable Word or pdf
documents) to the personnel, books and records, working papers, schedules and
calculations of the other used in the preparation of the applicable
Calculation Statement(s) and any Notice of Disagreement and the determination
of the Closing Net Working Capital, Final Closing Net Working Capital, or
Qualifying Royalty Revenues, as applicable (the " _Presented Values_ "), and
any Disputed Line Items and any other documents and information of the other
that are reasonably necessary for purposes of reviewing and verifying the
applicable calculations, and the Holder Representative and the Purchaser, as
the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond
promptly, in good faith and as fully and accurately as is reasonably
possible, to inquiries from the other Party related to such review.

 



33 (b) If the Holder Representative disagrees in whole or in part with
any Calculation Statement, then within 45 days after his, her or its receipt
of such Calculation Statement, the Holder Representative shall notify the
Purchaser of such disagreement in writing (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "),
setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars of any such disagreement.
To be effective, a Notice of Disagreement shall indicate the specific line
items of the applicable Calculation Statement that are in dispute (the "
_Disputed Line Items_ ") and shall be accompanied by the Holder
Representatives calculation of each of the Disputed Line Items and the Holder
Representatives revised Calculation Statement setting forth his, her or its
computation of the applicable Presented Value, as the case may be. All items
that are not Disputed Line Items shall be final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder unless the resolution of a Disputed Line Item affects
an undisputed item, in which case such undisputed item shall remain open and
be considered a Disputed Line Item to the extent of such corresponding effect.
If the Holder Representative does not provide a Notice of Disagreement
consistent with the terms of this _Section 3.8_ within any such 45-day
period, the Holder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted in full the
applicable Calculation Statement as prepared by the Purchaser, and such
Calculation Statement shall become final, binding and conclusive for
all purposes hereunder as of 5:00 p.m. Pacific time on such 45th day.

 

(c) If a Notice of Disagreement is properly and timely provided, the Purchaser
and the Holder Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a
period of 15 days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any Disputed Line Items. All Disputed Line Items agreed to in writing
during such period shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Purchaser,
the Holder Representative and the Effective Time Holders and not subject to
further appeal. If, at the end of any such 15-day period (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree), the Purchaser and the Holder
Representative are unable to resolve all such Disputed Line Items, then any
remaining Disputed Line Item shall be referred to any independent accounting
firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Holder Representative (which
accounting firm has not, within the prior 24 months, provided services to
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Acquired Companies or the Holder
Representative, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution.

 

(d) The Purchaser and the Holder Representative will enter into reasonable and
customary arrangements for the services to be rendered by the Independent
Accounting Firm under this _Section 3.8(d)_, such services to be provided in
the Independent Accounting Firms capacity as an accounting expert and not an
arbitrator. The Purchaser may require that the Independent Accounting Firm
enter into a customary form of confidentiality agreement with respect to the
work papers and other documents and information relating to the Acquired
Companies provided to the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this 
_Section 3.8_. The Independent Accounting Firm, acting as an expert and not
an arbitrator, shall be directed to determine as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within 30 days from the date that the dispute is submitted to
it) whether the Presented Values, as set forth in the applicable Calculation
Statement, require adjustment and the correct amount of any such adjustment.
The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed that, in making such
determination, it is only to consider matters still in dispute between the
Purchaser and the Holder Representative and shall make any calculations
consistently with the calculation methodologies set forth in this Agreement.
The Purchaser and the Holder Representative shall each furnish to the
Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the Disputed Line Items, and shall provide interviews
and answer questions, as such Independent Accounting Firm may reasonably
request. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be set
forth in a written report and, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and
binding for all purposes hereunder.

 

(e) The Purchaser shall reimburse the Holder Representative for all reasonable
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees
and expenses of any outside auditor) related to any Earn-Out Statement audit
permitted hereunder if it is ultimately determined in accordance with this
_Section 3.8_ that the actual Presented Values during the applicable period
collectively exceed by more than 10% the amount of the aggregate Presented
Values previously determined by the Purchaser and

 



34  set forth in the applicable Earn-Out Statements. Fifty percent of the cost
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Holder Representative
(solely on behalf of the Effective Time Holders in its capacity as the Holder
Representative, not in its individual capacity) and the remaining fifty
percent shall be paid by the Purchaser; _provided_ that the prevailing Party
in connection with the review by the Independent Accounting Firm (which Party
shall be the Party whose calculations of the Disputed Line Items that remain
in dispute on the date of commencement of the Independent Accounting Firms
review, in the aggregate, as reflected in the applicable Calculation
Statement or Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, were closest to the actual
values for the Disputed Line Items finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) will be reimbursed by the non-prevailing Party for the
prevailing Partys portion of the cost of the Independent Accounting Firm.

_Section 3.9_ _Issuance of Purchaser Shares_

(a) The aggregate amount of all Purchaser Shares issued in connection with the
Merger and this Agreement (together with all other Purchaser Shares (whether
represented by Purchaser Shares or securities convertible into or exercisable
for Purchaser Shares) that otherwise count toward such total under The NASDAQ
Stock Market Listing Rule 5635 (or any successor provision)) shall not exceed
19.9% of the Purchaser Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (not including any Purchaser Shares that are owned by the Purchaser and
without assuming the conversion or exercise of any options, warrants or other
convertible securities).

(b) In connection with the determination of the number of Purchaser
Shares issuable by the Purchaser to the Effective Time Holders in connection
with the Earn-Out Consideration, the Per Purchaser Share Value shall be used.

(c) No Closing Stock Consideration issued to the Effective Time Holders may be
offered, sold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise transferred or disposed of
(each, a " _Transfer_ ") prior to the expiration of the 90-day period
following the Closing Date, and following such 90-day period the Purchaser
Shares included in the Closing Stock Consideration received by an Effective
Time Holder may be Transferred as follows: (i) on the date that is 91 days
after the Closing Date and thereafter, 40% of such Purchaser Shares of such
Effective Time Holder may be Transferred (such that, on such 91st day and
thereafter, such Effective Time Holder may, in its sole discretion, Transfer
up to 40% of such Purchaser Shares); (ii) on the date that is 181 days after
the Closing Date and thereafter, an additional 40% of such Purchaser Shares of
such Effective Time Holder may be Transferred (such that, on such 181st day
and thereafter, such Effective Time Holder may, in its sole discretion,
Transfer up to an additional 40% of such Purchaser Shares (which means, for
purposes of clarity, that, to the extent such Effective Time Holder had not
transferred any of such Purchaser Shares prior to such 181st day, it could
transfer up to 80% of such Purchaser Shares on such 181st day and
thereafter)); and (iii) on the date that is 270 days after the Closing Date
and thereafter, the final 20% of such Purchaser Shares of such Effective Time
Holder may be Transferred such that 100% of such Purchaser Shares of such
Effective Time Holder may be Transferred from and after such time (the
foregoing restrictions collectively referred to as the " _Lock-Up Restriction_
"). Each certificate representing any such shares may, in the sole discretion
of the Purchaser, bear a legend referencing this Agreement and the foregoing
restrictions contained herein, and any such shares in uncertificated book
entry form may, in the sole discretion of the Purchaser, include such a legend
in a notice to the registered holder thereof in accordance with applicable
Law. Upon the release of any such shares from the Lock-Up Restriction, the
Purchaser shall cause, with respect to certificated shares, all legends to be
removed from such certificates within three Business Days of an Effective Time
Holders tender of such certificates to the Exchange Agent for removal and,
with respect to uncertificated shares, legends to be removed within three
Business Days of the 91st, 181st and 270th day after the Closing Date, as
applicable. Any other release agreed to by Purchaser from the Lock-Up
Restriction shall be made on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number
of Purchaser Shares received

 



35  by each Effective Time Holder as Closing Stock Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall restrict an Effective Time
Holder from offering or selling any such Closing Stock Consideration at any
time to the extent such offer or sale is an offer or sale of at least 10,000
shares (as adjusted after the date hereof for any stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalizations and the like in respect of the Purchaser
Shares occurring prior to any such sale) to a single purchaser or group of
Affiliated purchasers (a " _Block Trade_ "). In connection with any Block
Trade, the Purchaser shall cause all legends applicable to any Purchaser
Shares to be so offered or sold (to the extent not previously removed in
accordance with the preceding provisions of this _Section 3.9(c)_) to be
removed within three Business Days after the date on which (i) the Purchaser
shall have received from the Effective Time Holder intending to effect such
Block Trade a written request for such removal along with a written
certification that the subject Purchaser Shares will be sold solely pursuant
to a Block Trade and (ii), in the case of certificated shares, such Effective
Time Holder shall have tendered such certificates to the Exchange Agent for
removal.

(d) Notwithstanding the restrictions in this _Section 3.9_, nothing herein
shall prevent an Effective Time Holder from transferring Purchaser Shares, (i)
if her or she is an individual (A) to any member of his or her
immediate family, or to a trust for the benefit of such Effective Time Holder
or any member of his or her immediate family, or (B) upon his or her death;
(ii) if such Effective Time Holder is a limited partnership or limited
liability company, to a partner or member of such Effective Time Holder; or
(iii) if such Effective Time Holder is a corporation, to an Affiliate of such
Effective Time Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that a transfer referred to in
this sentence shall be permitted only if, as a precondition to such transfer,
the transferee executes an agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser pursuant to which such transferee agrees to be
bound by all of the terms of this  _Section 3.9_ with respect to the
Purchaser Shares transferred.

_Section 3.10_ _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary:

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
provide to the Purchaser IRS Forms W-8 and W-9, as applicable, from the
Effective Time Holders prior to the Effective Time. The Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and the Exchange Agent (collectively
the " _Withholding Agents_ "), as the case may be, will have the right to
deduct and withhold from all payments hereunder such Taxes as any such
Withholding Agent reasonably determines (taking into account all such IRS
Forms received by the Purchaser from the Effective Time Holders) are required
to be withheld from such payments under Sections 1441, 1442, 1471, 1472 and
3406 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations thereunder and any corresponding
provisions of state or local law. If any payments may be subject to
withholding under Sections 1471 and 1472, the procedures set forth in _Section
3.10(b)_ shall apply;

(b) Except as provided in _Section 3.10(c)_ with respect to Capital Gains
Taxes, if there is a change in Law after the date of this Agreement that
requires Taxes to be deducted and withheld from one or more payments pursuant
to this Agreement, the Withholding Agents shall have the right to deduct and
withhold such Taxes as any such Withholding Agent reasonably determines are
required to be deducted and withheld pursuant to such change in Law. In such
case, (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall provide written notice to the
Holder Representative of the Withholding Agents intent to deduct and withhold
Taxes from one or more payments hereunder at least twelve (12) Business Days
prior to the due date for the first such payment, (ii) the Holder
Representative will promptly forward such notice to the Effective Time
Holders, and each Effective Time Holder may deliver to the Withholding Agent
any applicable forms or certificates establishing an exemption or reduction
from such withholding for such Effective Time Holder no later than the
Business Day prior to the due date for the applicable payment, and (iii) if,
but only if, an exemption or reduction is established for all or a portion of
the affected payment(s) as reasonably determined in good faith by the
Withholding Agent, the Withholding Agent will make the affected payment(s) (or
portion thereof) without withholding or withholding at the reduced rate, as
appropriate;

 



36 (c) The Withholding Agents will have the right to deduct and withhold Capital
Gains Taxes from a payment pursuant to this Agreement only if (i) there is a
change of binding applicable Law (which in the case of India shall mean a
change of binding applicable Law due to a decision of the Supreme Court of
India or a change to the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 (or any successor Law)
or the regulations promulgated thereunder, which is enacted or promulgated
after the date of this Agreement that provides that withholding of Capital
Gains Tax is required) and a Withholding Agent obtains an opinion of
reputable local country counsel (which, for India, shall include Nishith Desai
Associates) concluding that withholding for Capital Gains Tax should be
required with respect to such payment, (ii) a Proceeding involving Capital
Gains Tax with respect to such payment has been finally resolved in accordance
with Section 9.4 and such resolution requires withholding of Capital Gains Tax
with respect to such payment, or (iii) such payment is then due and payable
to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement, a Proceeding
involving the application of Capital Gains Tax with respect to a previous
payment is then pending, and the Purchaser reasonably concludes in good faith
that, in the event such Proceeding results in an obligation to pay Capital
Gains Tax with respect to such previous payment, withholding of Capital Gains
Tax would also be required with respect to the payment that is then due and
payable, _provided that_ , in such case, unless the Purchaser and the Holder
Representative mutually agree to make a Deposit in accordance with _Section
9.4(d)_, the Purchaser may not pay to or deposit with the applicable
Governmental Authority the withheld Tax amount with respect to such payment
unless and until the pending Proceeding is finally resolved in accordance with
_Section 9.4(c)_ and either (A) such final resolution provides that
withholding of Capital Gains Tax is required with respect to such payment, or
(B) the Purchaser obtains an opinion of local country counsel (which, for
India, shall include Nishith Desai Associates) concluding that a payment to or
deposit with the applicable Governmental Authority should be required.
In each such case, (i) the applicable Withholding Agent shall provide written
notice (or shall cause a written notice to be provided) to the Holder
Representative of its intent to deduct and withhold Capital Gains Taxes from
the applicable payments hereunder at least twelve (12) Business Days prior to
the due date for the first such payment, (ii) the Holder Representative will
promptly forward such notice to the Effective Time Holders and each Effective
Time Holder may deliver to the Withholding Agent any applicable forms or
certificates establishing an exemption or reduction from such withholding no
later than the Business Day prior to the due date for the applicable payment,
and (iii) if, but only if, an exemption or reduction is established for all
or a portion of the affected payment(s) as reasonably determined by the
Withholding Agent in good faith, the Withholding Agent will make the affected
payment(s) (or portion thereof) without withholding or withholding at the
reduced rate, as appropriate; and

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Sections 3.10(a)_ , _(b)_
and _(c)_ , the Withholding Agents shall have the right to deduct and withhold
from payments hereunder pursuant to _Sections 3.1(e)_ and _3.2_ all Taxes that
any such Withholding Agent reasonably determines are required to be deducted
and withheld pursuant to applicable Law.

from sales actually made or services actually performed or advance invoices
permitted by Contract in the Ordinary Course. To the Companys Knowledge,
such Accounts Receivable will as of the Closing Date be collectible, net of
the respective reserve set forth in the corresponding line items on the
accounting records of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date (which
reserves have been calculated consistent with the past custom and practice of
the Acquired Companies, GAAP and _Schedule II_ ). No counter-party to any
Account Receivable is currently contesting payment or claiming any defense to
payment of or right to set-off against any Account Receivable, either with

damaged, defective or of below-standard quality, all of which has been written
off or written down to net realizable value in the accounting records of the
Acquired Companies in accordance with the past custom and practice of the
Acquired Companies. The values at which such Inventory is carried reflect the
Inventory valuation policy of the Company, which is in accordance with GAAP.
Since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, the Acquired Companies have
continued to replenish Inventory in the Ordinary Course and at a cost not
exceeding market prices prevailing at the time of purchase. No Acquired
Company has any commitments to purchase Inventory other than in the Ordinary
Course.

 

 _Section 4.9_ _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. No Acquired Company has any
Liability of a type required to be disclosed on a balance sheet (or the notes

expressly reserved for on the Balance Sheet or the Interim Balance Sheet, (b)
those incurred in the Ordinary Course after the date of the Interim Balance
Sheet and (c) those which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 _Section 4.13_ _Intellectual Property_

(a) All Intellectual Property owned, created, acquired, licensed or used by
any Acquired Company (the " _Company Intellectual Property_ ") constitutes all
of the Intellectual Property used in or necessary to conduct the businesses
of the Acquired Companies as conducted by the Acquired Companies. The Acquired
Companies are the sole owners of all right, title and interest in and to the
Owned Intellectual Property, including ownership of pending and accrued
causes of action for infringement and misappropriation and the sole and
exclusive right to bring actions for infringement and misappropriation. The
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, the consummation of the Merger and the fulfillment of
the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Company is a party will not give rise to any right of,
or result in any, revocation, withdrawal, suspension, acceleration,
cancellation, termination, modification, imposition of additional obligations,
or loss of rights with respect to, or any payment becoming due in respect of,
or the imposition of any Encumbrances on any of the Company Intellectual
Property. Immediately after the Closing, the Acquired Companies will be the
sole owners of, and will have valid title to, the Owned Intellectual Property,
and will have the right to use, license and transfer the Company Intellectual
Property in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions that the
Acquired Companies had immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) With respect to the Owned Intellectual Property, Section 4.13(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list that is accurate and complete in
all material respects (by name and owner, and where applicable, registration

Names (other than goodwill), copyright registrations, and copyright
registration applications, indicating for each, the applicable jurisdiction,
registration number (or application number) and date issued (or date filed)
and (ii) all Software. No Acquired Company has (x) transferred ownership
or co-ownership of, or granted an exclusive license of or exclusive right to
use, or authorized the retention of any exclusive rights to use or joint
ownership of, any Intellectual Property that is Owned Intellectual Property to
any other Person or (y) permitted any Acquired Companys rights in such Owned
Intellectual Property to be abandoned or cancelled or to enter into the public
domain, except to the extent such abandonment or cancellation occurs or has
occurred at the election of the Company during the ordinary course of
prosecuting applications relating to the Owned Intellectual Property in a
domestic or foreign patent office or other governmental institution. None of
the Owned Intellectual Property set forth on Schedule 4.13(b) with respect to
clause (i) of the second preceding sentence has been abandoned or cancelled.
Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule further identifies all
Contracts under which any Acquired Company has granted any license or other
right, whether exclusive or non-exclusive, in or to any of the Company
Intellectual Property to any Person, other than a non-exclusive license
granted by an Acquired Company in the Ordinary Course to a purchaser or
licensee of any of its products. No Acquired Company has consented in writing
to, approved in writing, or agreed in writing to any use or utilization of any
Company Intellectual Property other than under any such Contract or under any
such non-exclusive license of Company Intellectual Property.

 



45 (c) _Section 4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
that is accurate and complete in all material respects of all Intellectual
Property that any third party has licensed or sublicensed to any Acquired
Company or otherwise authorized any Acquired Company to use (the " _Third
Party Intellectual Property_ "), including a list of all related Contracts
(provided the Company need not separately list licenses of Internally Used
Shrinkwrap Software). Each Acquired Company has valid and legally enforceable
license rights to, or other rights to use, any Third Party Intellectual
Property that is used by such Acquired Company in the manner in which such
Third Party Intellectual Property is currently used by such Acquired Company.
No Acquired Company has granted any sublicense or other right with respect to
any such Third Party Intellectual Property except solely under such Contract
identified in Section 4.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or under any
other Contract providing for the non-exclusive license of Company
Intellectual Property to any Person granted by an Acquired Company in the
Ordinary Course to a purchaser or licensee of any of its products. No third
party that has licensed Third Party Intellectual Property to any Acquired
Company has ownership rights or license rights to improvements or derivative
works made by or for any Acquired Company based on such Third Party
Intellectual Property.

(d) The Owned Intellectual Property is free of all payment obligations (other
than any maintenance or other fees required to be paid to governmental
institutions in order to maintain such Owned Intellectual Property in force
and effect) and is not subject to any Judgments or limitations or restrictions
on use. No Person has any rights in the Owned Intellectual Property that could
cause any reversion or renewal of rights in favor of that Person or
termination of any Acquired Companys rights in the Owned Intellectual
Property. All payments due for any use of any Third Party Intellectual
Property have been paid, and no Acquired Company is in default or breach of
any material provision of any Contract pursuant to which any Third Party
Intellectual Property has been licensed or provided or its use permitted by an
Acquired Company. There is no Proceeding, Judgment, Contract or other
arrangement that prohibits or restricts any Acquired Company from carrying on
its business, or any portion of it, anywhere in the world or from any use of
the Company Intellectual Property.

(e) All Patent Rights, Marks and Names, and copyrights included in the Owned
Intellectual Property are subsisting, and to the Companys Knowledge are
valid, under applicable Law for those respective categories of Intellectual
Property. To the Companys Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists that would reasonably be expected to render any of the Owned
Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable. To the Companys Knowledge
(without any requirement for investigation by any of the individuals included
in such definition), all Patent Rights, Marks and Names, and copyrights that
are Third Party Intellectual Property, are valid and subsisting under
applicable Law for those respective categories of Intellectual Property. All
necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees in connection with each
item of material Owned Intellectual Property subject to a patent,
registration, or application have been made and all necessary documents and
certificates have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or
other authorities for purposes of maintaining or keeping such Intellectual
Property subsisting. There are no actions that must be taken within 60 days
of the Closing Date for the purposes of maintaining, perfecting, preserving or
renewing any material Company Intellectual Property, including the payment of
any registration, maintenance, annuity or renewal fees or the filing of
any documents, applications or certificates. All Patent Rights, Marks and
Names, and copyright registrations and copyright registration applications
with respect to any material Owned Intellectual Property have been duly filed
and maintained. The Company has delivered or made available to the Purchaser:

disclosures, each as amended to date, included in the Owned Intellectual
Property; (ii) all material files with respect to Marks and Names, each as
amended to date, included in the Owned Intellectual Property; and (iii)
accurate and complete copies of all maintenance documents and all other
written documentation evidencing ownership and prosecution of each such item.

 



46 (f) No Acquired Company has agreed to indemnify, defend or otherwise hold
harmless any other Person with respect to Losses resulting or arising from
the Company Intellectual Property, except under the Companys standard forms,
which forms are subject to modifications in the Ordinary Course, which
modifications do not materially deviate from the range of terms described in
_Section 4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and those other
Contracts listed in _Section 4.13(c)_.

(g) To the Companys Knowledge (without any requirement for investigation by
any of the individuals included in such definition), no Person has used or
disclosed (other than authorized uses and disclosures in accordance with the
Contracts listed in _Sections 4.13(b)_ and _4.13(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), infringed or misappropriated any of the Owned Intellectual Property
or any Third Party Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to any Acquired
Company. Immediately after the Closing, the Acquired Companies will have sole
rights to bring actions for infringement or misappropriation of the Owned
Intellectual Property. No Acquired Company has commenced or threatened in
writing any Proceeding, or asserted in writing any allegation or claim,
against any Person in six (6) years prior to the date hereof for infringement
or misappropriation of the Company Intellectual Property or breach of
any Contract involving the Company Intellectual Property.

(h) To the Companys Knowledge, neither the conduct of the businesses of the
Acquired Companies nor any products or services of the Acquired Companies
using, including or covered by any Company Intellectual Property, infringe or
misappropriate any other Persons Intellectual Property rights or constitute
unfair competition or trade practices under any Law. No Acquired Company has
received written notice or, to the Companys Knowledge, other notice in six
(6) years prior to the date hereof of any pending or threatened Proceeding or
any allegation or claim in which any Person alleges that any Acquired Company,
its business, products or services, or the Company Intellectual Property has
violated any Persons Intellectual Property rights. As of the date hereof,
there are no pending disputes between any Acquired Company and any other
Person relating to the Company Intellectual Property.

(i) Each Acquired Company has taken all commercially reasonable steps
necessary to protect, preserve and maintain the confidentiality of all trade
secrets and confidential business information included in the Company
Intellectual Property. All Persons who have received trade secrets or other
confidential information of any kind of any Acquired Company have entered into
written confidentiality agreements with such Acquired Company to protect the
secret or confidential status of such information, and, to the Companys
Knowledge, no Person has defaulted under or breached any term of any such
agreement. Each Acquired Company has taken all commercially reasonable steps
necessary to protect the confidentiality of information provided to
such Acquired Company by any other Person. In each case in which any Acquired
Company has acquired any of the Owned Intellectual Property through or from
any current or former employee, consultant, independent contractor or other
Person, such Acquired Company has obtained a valid and enforceable written
assignment agreement, substantially in the form set forth in Section 4.13(i)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, sufficient to irrevocably transfer all
rights, title and interest in that Intellectual Property to the Acquired
Company to the extent any such rights did not become the sole property of the
Acquired Company by operation of Law. To the Companys Knowledge, none of
those current or former employees, consultants, independent contractors or
other Persons has violated any of those agreements.

(j) Each Acquired Company has taken and takes commercially reasonable steps
to assure that all Software and data residing on its computer networks or
licensed or otherwise distributed to customers is free of any Malicious Code.
None of the Company Intellectual Property contains any Software or other
mechanism of any kind designed to disrupt, disable or harm in any manner the
operation of any software or hardware or other business processes or to
misuse, or to gain or permit unauthorized access to or misappropriate any
business or personal information, including any viruses, worms, bombs,
backdoors, clocks, timers, or other disabling device code, or designs or
routines that cause software or information to stop functioning temporarily or
permanently, be erased, inoperable, or otherwise incapable of being used,
either automatically or with passage of time or upon command (collectively, "
_Malicious Code_ ").

 



47 (k) All Software that is or that underlies or is utilized in any Owned
Intellectual Property of an Acquired Company does not, to the Companys
Knowledge, incorporate, depend upon or require for its functionality any
Software or other Intellectual Property that is not either Owned Intellectual
Property or Third Party Intellectual Property licensed to such Acquired
Company. None of the Owned Intellectual Property, and to the Knowledge of
Company, any Third Party Intellectual Property that is part of Company
Intellectual Property, was developed using any Governmental Authority or
university funding or facilities, nor was it obtained from a Governmental
Authority or university. No Acquired Company is a member of, or is obligated
to license or disclose any Intellectual Property to, any official or de facto
standards setting or similar organization or to any organizations members.
Except solely for the Open Source Software set forth in Section 4.13(k) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Owned Intellectual Property and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Third Party Intellectual Property,
constitutes, comprises, or includes any Open Source Software. The Open Source

used solely in connection with the Companys ATCA and compact PCI products.

obligated to provide health or welfare benefits to any active employee
following such employees retirement or other termination of service.

 



52 (d) Each Company Plan is and, during the six year period prior to the date of
this Agreement, has been maintained, funded, operated and administered, and
each Acquired Company has performed all of its obligations under each Company
Plan, in each case in all material respects in accordance with the terms of
such Company Plan and in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Acquired Company has
complied in all material respects with the provisions of COBRA, the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Family and
Medical Leave Act of 1993. Each Company Plan and each Company Employment
Agreement that provides deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code is in compliance in all material respects with applicable guidance
under Section 409A of the Code in form and operation. All nonstatutory stock
options granted by any Acquired Company were granted using an exercise price

exempt under Section 408 of ERISA has occurred with respect to any Company
Plan. No Acquired Company has incurred any penalty or tax with respect to any
Company Plan. All contributions and payments made or accrued with respect to
all Company Plans are deductible under Section 162 or 404 of the Code. Except
for routine claims for benefits submitted by participants or beneficiaries,
no claim against, or Proceeding involving, any Company Plan or any fiduciary
thereof is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, is threatened, which would
reasonably be expected to result in any material Liability, direct or
indirect (by indemnification or otherwise) of any Acquired Company to the DOL,
the IRS or any other Person. No Proceeding has been concluded that resulted in
any Liability of any Acquired Company or any ERISA Affiliate under any
Company Plan or Company Employment Agreement that has not been fully
discharged. No Contract with the IRS is being or has been negotiated with
respect to any Company Plan, no Qualified Plan has been subject to a
correction under the Employee Plan Compliance Resolution System as described
in Revenue Procedure 2008-50 (or any successor Revenue Procedure) and no
Company Plan has been submitted to the DOL under its voluntary fiduciary
correction program, in each case that could result in any Liability of any
Acquired Company or ERISA Affiliate.

(f) Each Qualified Plan of each Acquired Company has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS that it is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that its related trust is exempt from federal
income Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, and each such Qualified Plan
complies in form and in operation in all material respects with the
requirements of the Code and meets the requirements of a "qualified plan"
under Section 401(a) of the Code in all material respects. To the Companys
Knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to disqualification or loss of Tax-exempt status of
any such Qualified Plan or trust. Each Company Plan required to have
been registered or approved by any non-United States Governmental Authority
has been so registered or approved, as the case may be, no such approval has
been revoked (nor, to the Companys Knowledge, has revocation been threatened)
and no event has occurred since the date of such registration or approval
that, to the Companys Knowledge, would reasonably be expected to materially
affect any such registration or approval.

 



53 (g) Each Acquired Company has the right to modify and terminate benefits
(other than pensions) under each Company Plan with respect to both retired
and active employees. No individual classified as a non-employee for purposes
of receiving employee benefits (such as an independent contractor, leased
employee, consultant or special consultant), regardless of treatment for
other purposes, is eligible to participate in or receive benefits under any
Company Plan. Each Company Plan sponsored by each Acquired Company permits
assumption thereof by the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries upon the Closing
without the consent of the participants or any other Person.

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will not cause
accelerated vesting, payment or delivery of, or increase the amount or value
of any payment or benefit under or in connection with any Company Plan or any
Company Employment Agreement or constitute a "deemed severance" or "deemed
termination" under any Company Plan or Company Employment Agreement otherwise
with respect to, any director, officer, employee, or former director, former
officer or former employee of any Acquired Company and will not result in any
material breach or violation of, or a material default under, any Company Plan
or any Company Employment Agreement. No Acquired Company has made or become
obligated to make, and except as set forth in the information provided by the
Company pursuant to _Section 6.13_, no Acquired Company will as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement become
obligated to make, any payments that could be nondeductible by reason of
Section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(5)(B) thereof) or
Section 162(m) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of foreign, state
or local Law), nor will any Acquired Company be required to "gross up" or
otherwise compensate any individual because of the imposition of any excise
Tax by reason of Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax by reason of
Section 409A of the Code on such a payment to the individual.

(i) The Retention Plan Pool is the maximum amount payable by the Company under
the Retention Plan. The Company has provided the Purchaser with its
preliminary list, as of the date of this Agreement, of all Company Employees
or other individuals who are or may at any time be entitled to any payments,
distributions or benefits under the Retention Plan and the percentage
interests in the Retention Plan of such Company Employees or other
individuals, which Company Employees and other individuals and percentage
interests are subject to change prior to the Effective Time (but none of
which changes shall cause the aggregate Retention Plan Interests to exceed
100%). The obligations of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
other Acquired Companies under the Retention Plan are limited solely to the
payments and distributions expressly required to be made by or on behalf of
the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation (including by the Exchange Agent or
the Escrow Agent) to the Retention Plan Participants under this Agreement,
which payments and distributions shall not, in the aggregate, exceed the
Retention Plan Pool (giving effect to any Purchaser Shares received by
Retention Plan Participants under the Agreement based on their interests in
the Retention Plan at the Per Purchaser Share Value).

applicable Acquired Company, would reasonably be deemed, a Company Employee.
No individual, group of individuals or Governmental Authority has commenced,
or to the Companys Knowledge, threatened any claims, causes of action,
complaints or audits which characterize or could lead to a finding that

Ordinary Course, which modifications do not materially deviate from the range
of terms described in Section 4.22 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. No
product manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or delivered by any Acquired
Company is, to the Companys Knowledge, subject to any guaranty, warranty or
other indemnity beyond those set forth pursuant to the previous sentence in

since January 1, 2008 have maintained, in full force and effect, certificates
of insurance, binders and policies (accurate and complete copies of which

types and in such amounts and for such risks, casualties and contingencies as
is reasonably adequate in accordance with industry practice against insurable
Losses, damages, claims and risks customarily insured for by companies in the
Acquired Companies respective businesses to or in connection with or relating
to their respective businesses, properties, assets and operations. All
premiums due and payable under such certificates of insurance, binders and
policies have been paid and each Acquired Company is otherwise in compliance
in all material respects with the terms thereof. To the Companys Knowledge,
there is no threatened termination of, or material premium increase with
respect to, any such certificate of insurance, binder or policy. Section 4.24
of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list that is accurate and
complete in all material respects of all claims asserted by any Acquired
Company pursuant to any such

 



59  certificate of insurance, binder or policy since January 1, 2008, and

Acquired Company has failed to give in a timely manner any notice of any
material claim that may be insured under any certificate of insurance, binder
or policy required to be listed in Section 4.24 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and there are no outstanding claims which have been denied or
disputed by the insurer. Since January 1, 2008, no Acquired Company has ever

laws and similar laws of any foreign country, except, in the case of clauses

be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the
business, to which the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or of
which any of their property is the subject. There are no material Proceedings

 _Section 5.6_ _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_

 

(a) The Purchaser has timely filed or furnished all registration statements,
prospectuses, forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and other information incorporated therein) required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (the " _SEC
Reports_ "). The SEC Reports (after giving effect to all amendments thereto)
were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and all applicable
rules and regulations thereunder. The Purchaser has delivered or made
available to the Company accurate and complete copies of all comment letters
and other communications received from the SEC since January 1, 2010 and prior
to the date of this Agreement that are not publicly available via the
Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system of the SEC,
including the Purchasers responses to such comment letters and other
communications. To the Purchasers Knowledge, none of the SEC Reports is the
subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or investigations by
the SEC or any internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of the Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries. The SEC Reports, at the time filed or, in the case
of registration statements, at each date of effectiveness, complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as it may be amended from
time to time (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), applicable to such SEC Report,
and, at the time filed or, in the case of registration statements, at each
date of effectiveness, did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, and except
to the extent that information contained in any SEC Report has been revised,
amended, supplemented or superseded by a later-filed SEC Report, none of the
SEC Reports contains or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omits or will omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made or will be made, not misleading. No
Subsidiary of the Purchaser is required to file any reports or
other documents with the SEC.

(b) The consolidated financial statements contained in the SEC Reports
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto): (i) complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except as may be indicated in the notes to
such consolidated financial statements and except that the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements contained in the SEC Reports do not contain
footnotes as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act; and (iii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Purchaser as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows of the Purchaser for the periods covered
thereby, except that the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
contained in the SEC Reports were or are subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments, the effect of which will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be material. No financial statements of any Person other than the Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the financial
statements of the Purchaser.

(c) The Purchaser maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2010 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Purchaser and its

 



63  Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
Purchaser; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
assets of the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that would have a material effect
on the financial statements. The Purchasers management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Purchasers system of internal controls
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, and
such assessment concluded that such controls were effective and the
Purchasers independent registered accountant has issued (and not
subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding that the
Purchaser maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2010. Each of the principal executive officer (as defined under
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) of the Purchaser and the principal financial officer
(as defined under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) of the Purchaser (or each former
principal executive officer of the Purchaser and each former principal
financial officer of the Purchaser, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the SEC Reports, and
the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. Since
January 1, 2010, none of the Purchaser, the Board of Directors of the
Purchaser and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Purchaser
has identified or received notice of any: (i) significant deficiency or
material weakness (each as defined Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting utilized by the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) any
illegal act or fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Purchasers
senior management and relates to accounting or auditing practices or
procedures; or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.
Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries have outstanding, or have
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(d) The Purchaser maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure
that all information required to be disclosed in the Purchasers reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Purchasers management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable each of the principal executive officer of
the Purchaser and the principal financial officer of the Purchaser to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.
The Purchaser is in compliance in all material respects with all current
listing and corporate governance requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select
Market applicable to it.

 

(e) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or has any
obligation or other commitment to become a party to any joint venture,
securitization transaction, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar
Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries in the Purchasers or
any of its Subsidiaries published financial statements, the SEC Reports or
any other document furnished or filed with the SEC.

 



64 _Section 5.7_ _Compliance with Laws, Judgments and
Governmental Authorizations_. Without limiting the scope of any other
representation in this Agreement, the Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries
is in compliance and has at all times within the past five years been in
compliance in all respects with all Laws, Judgments or Governmental
Authorizations applicable to it or to the conduct of its business or the
ownership or use of any of its properties or assets, except for any such
defaults or violations or instances of non-compliance that would
not reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has received at any time
within the past five years any written notice or other written communication,
or to the Purchasers Knowledge, any other notice, from any Governmental
Authority or any other Person regarding any actual, alleged or potential
violation of, or failure to comply with, any applicable material Law, Judgment
or Governmental Authorization, any actual or threatened revocation,
withdrawal, suspension, cancellation, termination or modification of any
material Governmental Authorization, or any actual, alleged or potential
obligation on the part of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to
undertake, or to bear all or any portion of the cost of, any material
remedial action of any nature.

of directors of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or to vote on any
other matter, except upon conversion thereof into Equity Interests of the
Purchaser.

 

(c) All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Purchaser and the

COVENANTS

_Section 6.1 Access and Investigation_. Until the Closing and upon
reasonable advance notice from the Purchaser, the Company will, and will cause
each other Acquired Company to, allow the Purchaser and its directors,
officers, employees, agents, prospective financing sources, consultants and
other advisors and representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to, and furnish them with all documents, records, work papers and
information with respect to, all of the properties, assets, personnel, books,
Contracts, Governmental Authorizations, reports and records relating to any
Acquired Company as the Purchaser may reasonably request. In addition, until
the Closing, the Company will cause its and the Acquired Companies
accountants to cooperate with the Purchaser and its representatives in making
available the financial information of the Acquired Companies as reasonably
requested. For clarity, nothing herein shall require any Acquired Company to
provide access, or to disclose any information, if, in the reasonable
judgment of such Acquired Company, such provision of access or disclosure of
information would (a) violate any confidentiality agreement or term in any
agreement regarding confidentiality to which any Acquired Company is a party
on the date hereof, (b) jeopardize protections afforded an Acquired Company
under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine, (c)
materially interfere with the conduct of the business of any Acquired Company

to comply with the Companys obligations under this Agreement, or (iv) as
necessary to ensure that each of the Acquired Companies complies with
applicable Laws and contractual obligations, the Company will, and the Company
will cause each Acquired Company to:

 

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business only in
the Ordinary Course and preserve and protect its business organization,
employment relationships, and relationships with customers, strategic
partners, suppliers, distributors, landlords and others having dealings with
it;

 

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to pay its accounts payable and
other obligations when they become due and payable in the Ordinary Course;

to it or its business, properties or assets;

Property and all of its other properties and assets in a state of repair and
condition that is consistent in all material respects with the requirements of

67 (v) use its commercially reasonable efforts to continue in full force
and effect the certificates of insurance, binders and policies of the
Acquired Companies; and

(vi) maintain its books and records consistent with its past custom and
practice.

(b) _Negative Covenants_. Until the Closing, except (i) as expressly
permitted by this Agreement or as otherwise expressly consented to by the
Purchaser in writing (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed by the Purchaser), (ii) as set forth in Section 6.2 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (iii) to the extent necessary to comply with the
Companys obligations under this Agreement, or (iv) as necessary to ensure
that each of the Acquired Companies complies with applicable Laws
and contractual obligations, the Company will not, and the Company will cause
the Acquired Companies not to:

(i) take any action, or fail to take any action within its control, as a
result of which any of the changes or events in _Section 4.10_ would occur;

(ii) make, change or revoke any Tax election, change any annual Tax accounting
period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, enter into any closing
or settlement agreement with respect to Taxes, file any amended Tax Return,
surrender any right to a claim for a Tax refund, consent to any extension or
waiver of any period of limitation applicable to any Tax, settle or compromise
any Tax claims or assessment, or take or omit to take any other action, if
any such action or omission would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
materially increasing a future Tax liability of any Acquired Company, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Purchaser or any Subsidiary of the Purchaser;
or 

(iii) agree, whether in writing or otherwise, to do any of the foregoing.

 

 _Section 6.3_ _Consents and Filings; Reasonable Efforts_

 

(a) Each of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, to obtain all
Governmental Authorizations from, give all notices to, and make all filings
with, all Governmental Authorities, and to obtain all Consents listed
on Section 7.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section 7.2(c) of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, and give all other notices to all other
applicable Persons that are necessary or advisable in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within five Business

the Purchaser will each file a Notification and Report Form and related
material with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act all pre-merger
notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws of
other applicable jurisdictions as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any
event within 10 Business Days following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

(c) The Company and the Purchaser will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain early termination, or to otherwise expedite
clearance, of all applicable waiting periods and will promptly make any other
submissions which are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including supplying
all supplemental information requested by the U.S. Department of Justice or
the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in connection with the Notification and
Report Form filed pursuant to the HSR Act.

 



68 (d) The Company and the Purchaser will take all commercially reasonable steps
to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Authorities or other persons or entities, and to defend against
any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed.

 

(e) The foregoing will not be deemed to require the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to enter into any Contract, consent decree or other commitment
requiring the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including for this purpose
the Acquired Companies) to divest (including through the granting of any
license rights) or hold separate any assets or to take any other action that
would have an adverse effect on the business, assets, properties,
Liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), operating results, operations
or prospects of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including for this
purpose the Acquired Companies). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Acquired Companies operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Acquired Companies shall exercise, consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over their
respective businesses, assets and operations.

_Section 6.4_ _Notification_. Until the Closing, each of Purchaser, Merger
Sub and the Company will use best efforts to give prompt written notice to the
other Party of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, to such Partys
Knowledge, of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would
reasonably be expected to cause any representation or warranty of such Party
contained in this Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate, in each
case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
(b) the failure to comply with or satisfy the covenants and agreements to be
complied with or satisfied by such Party under this Agreement in any material
respect and (c) the failure of any condition precedent to the other Partys
obligations under this Agreement. No notification pursuant to this _Section
6.4_ will be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, prevent or cure any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or breach of covenant, or limit or otherwise affect any
rights or remedies available to the Parties, including pursuant to  _Article
8_ or _Article 10_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the
extent a breach of this _Section 6.4_ relates to a breach of a representation
or warranty, the non-breaching Party (and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
or Company Indemnified Parties with which it is affiliated) shall only be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1(a)_ or _10.2(a)_ , as
applicable, therefor, which indemnification will be subject to the
limitations set forth in _Article 10_.

_Section 6.5_ _No Solicitation_

 

(a) The Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and
financial advisors (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or knowingly
facilitate the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) furnish or make available any non-public information regarding any of the

of making or pursuing an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction or requiring the Company to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or breach its obligations hereunder or (vi) agree to do any of
the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by the Stockholder Vote, this _Section 6.5(a)_ shall not prohibit
the Company from furnishing nonpublic information regarding the

 



69  Acquired Companies to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is, or is reasonably
likely to result in, a Superior Proposal that is submitted to the Company by
such Person (and not withdrawn prior to the furnishing of such information or
such discussions) if (A) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 6.5_, (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after having
taken into account the advice of its outside legal counsel, that such action
is required in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Stockholders under applicable Laws, (C) at least one
Business Day prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or
entering into discussions with, such Person, the Company gives
Purchaser written notice of the Companys intention to furnish nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person, and the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company and
containing terms no less favorable to the Company than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (but expressly permitting the Company to comply
with its disclosure obligations to the Purchaser hereunder), and (D) at least
one Business Day prior to furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person, the Company furnishes or makes available such nonpublic information
to the Purchaser (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously furnished or made available by or on behalf of the Company to the
Purchaser). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that any violation of or the taking of any action
inconsistent with any of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence
by any Company Representative, whether or not such Company Representative is
purporting to act on behalf of any of the Acquired Companies, shall be deemed
to constitute a breach of this _Section 6.5_ by the Company.

(b) The Company shall promptly advise Purchaser of any Acquisition Proposal,
any inquiry or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information
relating to any of the Acquired Companies (including the terms thereof) that
is made or submitted by any Person prior to Closing for the purpose of
evaluating a possible Acquisition Transaction. The Company shall keep
Purchaser fully and timely informed with respect to the status of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or request and any
modification or proposed modification thereto.

(c) On execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that
relate to any Acquisition Proposal. 

(d) The Company agrees not to terminate or release or permit any of the other
Acquired Companies to release any Person from, or to waive or permit any of
the other Acquired Companies to waive any provision of, any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar Contract to which any of the Acquired Companies is a
party, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce or cause
to be enforced each such Contract at the request of Purchaser.

_Section 6.6_  _Confidentiality_

(a) Each of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to abide by (and
agrees to cause their respective applicable Affiliates to abide by) that
certain Confidentiality Agreement dated as of January 14, 2011 between the
Purchaser and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of
which are incorporated by reference in this Agreement and which terms will
survive until the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement will
terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will continue
in full force and effect. Except as contemplated by _Section 6.7_, the
existence of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the terms hereof
and thereof (including the exhibits and schedules appended hereto and
thereto) will be deemed "Confidential Information" for purposes of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



70 (b) The Holder Representative shall, and shall cause his, her or its
agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to:
(i) treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any
Person to) all confidential or proprietary information with respect to the
Purchaser and its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies, received by
it in connection with the Parties performance of their respective obligations
hereunder, unless the Holder Representative or any such agent, representative,
Affiliate, employee, officer or director becomes legally compelled to
disclose any such information, in which case the Holder Representative or such
agent, representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director shall provide
the Purchaser with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the
Purchaser, the Company or any other Acquired Company may seek a protective
order or other remedy and (ii) if such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained in a reasonable time, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived
compliance with this _Section 6.6(b)_ and the Holder Representative (or its
agent, representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director, as the case
may be) may furnish only that portion of such confidential information which
is legally required to be provided; provided, however, that this sentence
shall not apply to any information that, (i) at the time of disclosure, is
available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by the
Holder Representative or his, her or its agents, representatives, Affiliates,
employees, officers or directors or (ii) was in the possession of the Holder
Representative prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, following the Closing: (x) the Holder
Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Holder Representative in connection with the Merger as
long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein and (y) the Holder
Representative may disclose such confidential or proprietary information to
(A) employees of the Holder Representative, (B) advisors or consultants of
the Holder Representative, who have a need to know such information and have
agreed to keep such information confidential and (C) the Effective Time
Holders, _provided_ that such persons have either contractually agreed to be
bound by the terms of this _Section 6.6(b)_ or executed and delivered to the
Purchaser a confidentiality agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
D_ (or, in the case of Intel Corporation or one of its entity
Affiliates, shall have executed and delivered CNDA No. 6012348 dated November
30, 2004); _provided_ , that the Holder Representative communicating limited,
basic information to the Effective Time Holders regarding the balances in the
Escrow Account and the Holder Representative Fund, the status and timing of
potential working capital and earnout payments, the status and timing of
claims against the Escrow Account, and other similar information, in each case
without disclosing any substantive details about the matters underlying the
foregoing, shall not be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.6(b)_.

_Section 6.7_ _Public Announcements_. Any public announcement or similar
publicity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not be issued by the Company or the Purchaser without the
prior written approval of the other Party except (a) as required by an action
or Judgment of a Governmental Authority or as required under applicable Law,
(b) the Purchaser reserves the right, without the Companys prior consent, to
make any public disclosure it believes is required by applicable securities
Laws or securities listing standards (in which case the Purchaser agrees to
use reasonable efforts to advise the Company prior to making such disclosure)
and (c) the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Holder Representative and
the Effective Time Holders may publicly announce or disclose any information
which the Purchaser has previously disclosed publicly. The Purchaser and the
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with each other
concerning the means by which the employees, customers, suppliers and others
having dealings with the Acquired Companies will be informed of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Purchaser has the
right to be present for any such communication. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, following the public announcement by the Purchaser of
the Closing, the Holder Representative shall be permitted to publicly
announce that it has been engaged to serve as the Holder Representative in
connection with the Merger as long as such announcement does not disclose any
of the terms of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein.

 



71 _Section 6.8_ _Fairness Hearing and Permit Application;
Registration Statement_

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall prepare, with the cooperation of the Purchaser, an information
statement for the Stockholders to approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Information Statement_ "). The Information
Statement shall constitute a disclosure document for the offer and issuance
of the Purchaser Shares pursuant to this Agreement. The Company and the
Purchaser shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Information Statement to comply with applicable federal and state securities
laws requirements. Each of the Purchaser and the Company agree to provide
promptly to the other such information concerning its business and financial
statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing Party
or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the
Information Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and to
cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the others counsel and
auditors in the preparation of the Information Statement. The Company will
promptly advise the Purchaser, and the Purchaser will promptly advise the
Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either shall
obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it necessary or appropriate to
amend or supplement the Information Statement in order to make the statements
contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or to comply
with applicable Law. The Company will provide the Purchaser with a
reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment on any information with
respect to the Purchaser or its Affiliates to be included in the Information
Statement.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall prepare, with the cooperation of Company, and cause to be filed with the
California Commissioner a Permit Application (with the initial submission of
the Permit Application to the California Commissioner to occur no later than
10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement), and shall request a
hearing (the " _Fairness Hearing_ ") on the fairness of the terms and
conditions of the Merger pursuant to Section 25142 of the California
Corporations Code for the issuance of the Purchaser Shares to be issued in the
Merger. The Company and the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the California Commissioner to approve the fairness of the
terms and conditions of the Merger at such a Fairness Hearing and issue a
permit under Section 25121 of the California Corporations Code (the "
_Fairness Approval_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser shall not
be required to modify any of its Governing Documents or any of the economic
terms of the Merger in order to cause the California Commissioner to approve
the fairness of such terms and conditions. The Company shall promptly furnish
the Purchaser all information relating to the Acquired Companies and the
Stockholders that is reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this  _Section 6.8(b)_. None of the information supplied by
the Company to the Purchaser, the California Commissioner of Corporations or
any representative thereof in connection with the Permit Application or any
other document prepared to comply with federal or state securities Laws shall
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Purchaser will provide the Company with a reasonable advance opportunity to
review and comment on any information with respect to the Acquired Companies
to be included in the Permit Application. None of the information supplied by
the Purchaser to the Company or the California Commissioner of Corporations or
any representative thereof in connection with the Permit Application, the
Information Statement or any other document prepared to comply with federal or
state securities Laws shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. If either the Purchaser or the Company becomes aware of
any information that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the
Permit Application, then such Party shall promptly inform the other Party
thereof and the Purchaser shall provide: (i) the Company (and its counsel)
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Permit Application prior to it being filed with the
California Commissioner; and (ii) the Company with a copy of such amendment
or supplement promptly after it is filed with the California Commissioner.

 



72 (c) The Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to complete on a
timely basis for inclusion, if applicable, in the Registration Statement the
pro forma financial statements (including notes thereto) for the year ended
December 31, 2010 in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of
Regulation S-X. In the event the California Commissioner (a) denies the
Fairness Approval or (b) does not issue the Fairness Approval (or if the
Purchaser and the Company mutually determine that they will not receive the
Fairness Approval) by July 15, 2011, then the Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a Registration Statement
to be effective prior to the approval of the Merger by the Stockholders, for
purposes of registering under the Securities Act the offering and issuance by
the Purchaser of the Closing Stock Consideration and any Purchaser Shares that
may be issuable pursuant to _Sections 3.7(b)_. Each of the Purchaser and the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts: (i) to cause
the Registration Statement to comply with the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC; (ii) to promptly notify the other of,
cooperate with each other with respect to and respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff; (iii) to have the Registration Statement declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after it is
filed with the SEC; and (iv) to keep the Registration Statement effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Purchaser and the Company shall
promptly furnish the other Party all information concerning such Party, its
Subsidiaries and its stockholders that is required or reasonably requested in
connection with any action contemplated by this _Section 6.8(c_). If either
the Purchaser or the Company becomes aware of any information that should be
disclosed in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement, then
such Party shall promptly inform the other Party thereof and the Purchaser
shall: (i) provide the Company (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement prior to it being filed with the SEC; (ii) provide the
Company with a copy of such amendment or supplement promptly after it is filed
with the SEC; and (iii) cooperate, if appropriate, in mailing such amendment
or supplement to the Stockholders.

_Section 6.9_ _Consent of Stockholders_

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the California Commissioner shall have
issued a permit under Section 25121 of the California Corporations Code for
the issuance of the Purchaser Shares to be issued as Merger Consideration or
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, as
applicable (but in no event any later than 10 Business Days following the
receipt of the permit or the effective date of the Registration Statement, as
applicable), the Company shall submit this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) to the holders of Company Capital
Stock for approval and adoption as provided by applicable Law and the
Companys Governing Documents. Subject to _Section 6.9(c)_, the Information
Statement shall include the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Stockholders vote to adopt this Agreement (the recommendation of the Company
Board being referred to as the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ").

(b) Subject to _Section 6.9(c_), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall: (i) withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to the Purchaser; (ii) fail to reaffirm, without
qualification, the Company Board Recommendation, or fail to notify the
Stockholders (which notice may be deemed given pursuant to the issuance of a
widely disseminated press release), without qualification, that the Merger
and this Agreement are in the best interests of the Stockholders, within five
Business Days after the Purchaser requests in writing that such action be
taken; (iii) fail to notify the Stockholders (which notice may be deemed
given pursuant to the issuance of a widely disseminated press release),
within 10 Business Days after a tender offer or exchange offer relating to
securities of the Company shall have been commenced, that the Company Board
recommends 

 



73  rejection of such tender or exchange offer; (iv) fail to notify the
Stockholders (which notice may be deemed given pursuant to the issuance of any
a widely disseminated press release), within 10 Business Days after an
Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, of its opposition to such
Acquisition Proposal; (v) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal; or (vi) resolve or agree to take any action described in
clauses (i) through (v) of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions
described in clauses (i) through (vi) of this sentence being referred to as a
" _Change in Recommendation_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.9(b_),
at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Stockholder Vote,
the Company Board may effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may
be, a Change in Recommendation, but only:

(i) if: (A) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal that is
a Superior Proposal is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (B) such
Acquisition Proposal was not obtained or made as a result of a violation or
breach of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement; (C) at least three
Business Days prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company
Board will consider and determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, the Company provides the Purchaser with a written notice
specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding such
meeting, the terms and conditions of the offer that is the basis of
the potential action by the Company Board (including a copy of any draft
definitive agreement reflecting the Acquisition Proposal); (D) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the
advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation (it being understood that SagePoint Advisors qualifies as such),
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (E) the
Company Board does not effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Change in
Recommendation at any time within three Business Days after the Purchaser
receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Company Board has
determined that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (F) during
such three Business Day period, if requested by the Purchaser, the Company
engages in good faith negotiations with the Purchaser to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to
constitute a Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal; (G)
at the end of such three Business Day period, such Acquisition Proposal has
not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
Purchaser as a result of the negotiations required by clause (F) or
otherwise); and (H) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
obtaining and taking into account the advice of outside legal counsel and an
independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (it being
understood that SagePoint Advisors qualifies as such), that, in light of such
Superior Proposal, a Change in Recommendation is required in order for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Stockholders
under applicable Law; or

 

(ii) if: (A) a material development or change in circumstances occurs or
arises after the date of this Agreement that was neither known to any
Acquired Company or any Company Representative nor reasonably foreseeable to
any Acquired Company or any Company Representative as of the date of this
Agreement, other than any Acquisition Proposal subject to _Section
6.9(c)(i)_ (such material development or change in circumstances being
referred to as an " _Intervening Event_ "); (B) at least three Business Days
prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board will
consider and determine whether such Intervening Event requires the Company
Board to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Change in Recommendation,
the Company provides the Purchaser with a written notice specifying the
date and time of such meeting and the reasons for holding such meeting,
including a reasonably detailed description of the Intervening Event; (C)
during such three Business Day period, if requested by the Purchaser, the
Company engages in good faith negotiations with the Purchaser

 



74  to amend this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need for the Company
Board to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Change in Recommendation as
a result of such Intervening Event; and (D) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after obtaining and taking into account the advice of outside
legal counsel and an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation (it being understood that SagePoint Advisors qualifies as such),
that, in light of such Intervening Event, a Change in Recommendation is
required in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Stockholders under applicable Law.

 

 _Section 6.10_ _Representation on Purchaser Board_. Immediately following
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall increase the size of its board of
directors by one and shall appoint one of the Companys current directors to
the board of directors of the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
Closing occurs after proxy materials for the Purchasers 2011 annual meeting
of shareholders have been sent to the Purchasers shareholders, such
appointment shall be made as soon as practicable following, but not later then
five Business Days after, the conclusion of the Purchasers 2011 annual
meeting of shareholders.

_Section 6.11_ _Assumption of Options and Related Matters_. Each Unvested
Option that is assumed by the Purchaser under this Agreement (each an "
_Assumed Option_ " and, collectively, the " _Assumed Options_ ") shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
the vesting arrangements and other applicable terms and conditions set forth
in the Stock Option Plan and any applicable stock option agreement) as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Original Vesting
Requirements_ "), except that (i) such Assumed Option shall be exercisable for
that number of whole Purchaser Shares equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares subject to the Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (y) the Share Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the nearest
whole number of Purchaser Shares; (ii) the per-share exercise price of such
Assumed Option (the " _Assumed Option Exercise Price_ ") shall be equal to
the product of (x) the per-share exercise price of the original Unvested
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Price Ratio (as
defined below), rounded up to the nearest whole cent; and (iii) the portion
of the Assumed Options that are Contingent Assumed Options (as defined below)
shall be subject to certain additional terms and conditions as specified in
this _Section 6.11_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
assumption by the Purchaser of any Unvested Options shall comply in all
material respects with the requirements of Treasury Regulation
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) such that the Unvested Options shall continue to be
exempt from application of Section 409A of the Code, but shall no longer
qualify as incentive stock options for purposes of Section 422 of the Code.
Promptly after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall issue to each person who
immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding
Unvested Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Option
by the Purchaser, which includes the number of Purchaser Shares and the per
share exercise price applicable to the Assumed Option, including the
applicable number of Purchaser Shares subject to Non-Contingent Assumed
Options (as defined below), and the maximum potential number of Purchaser
Shares subject to Contingent Assumed Options (as defined below) that may
be subsequently released by Purchaser to such person.

(a) For purposes of this _Section 6.11_, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

(i) " _Assumed Option Holder_ " means a Continuing Employee who immediately
prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding Unvested Option and
following the Effective Time is the holder of an Assumed Option.

(ii) " _Assumed Option Spread Value Per Share_ " with respect to each Assumed
Option means the Per Purchaser Share Value less the applicable Assumed Option
Exercise Price.

 



75 (iii) " _Contingent Assumed Option_ " means with respect to each Assumed
Option such portion exercisable for a number of Purchaser Shares equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product of (x) the number of Unvested
Options held by the applicable holder immediately prior to the Effective Time
from which the Assumed Option was converted, multiplied by (y) the Per Common
Share Contingent Price by (ii) the Assumed Option Spread Value Per Share,
rounded up to the nearest whole number of Purchaser Shares.

 

(iv) " _Non-Contingent Assumed Optio_ n" means with respect to each Assumed
Option such portion that is not a Contingent Assumed Option.

(v) " _Price Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient, calculated to five decimal
places, obtained by dividing (x) the Per Purchaser Share Value by (y) the Per
Common Share Maximum Conversion Price.

(vi) " _Share Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient, calculated to five decimal
places, obtained by dividing (x) the Per Common Share Maximum Conversion Price
by (y) the Per Purchaser Share Value.

(b) In no event shall an Assumed Option Holder have the right to exercise any
Contingent Assumed Options that have not been released by the Purchaser to
the Assumed Option Holder as specified herein. It is intended that the
provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall operate so as to provide for an
equitable adjustment to the number of Assumed Options that are potentially
exercisable by an Assumed Option Holder upon any release of any Escrow Shares,
payment of any Earn-Out Consideration, payment of any Final Working Capital
Payment Amount, and release of any funds from the Holder Representative Fund
(together the " _Contingent Payment Amounts_ "), such that the Assumed Option
Holder will have the right to acquire exactly the same number of Purchaser
Shares as if the actual applicable Contingent Payment Amounts had been
known at the Effective Time and the Unvested Option had been converted into
the Assumed Option on such basis, and any ambiguities herein shall be
interpreted accordingly. Contingent Assumed Options released to an Assumed
Option Holder shall remain subject to the Original Vesting Requirements in
the same proportion as the related Non-Contingent Assumed Options to the
extent such Original Vesting Requirements are not satisfied prior to the
applicable Scheduled Release Date(s) (as defined below). 

(c) Contingent Assumed Options shall be released by the Purchaser to the
Assumed Option Holder, and potentially exercisable with respect to such
number of Contingent Assumed Options, as determined and on the date(s) (the "
_Scheduled Release Date(s)_ ") as follows:

(i) upon the release of any Escrow Shares, the Purchaser shall release such
number of Contingent Assumed Options exercisable for a number of Purchaser
Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the Per Share Escrow Amount by (B) the total number of shares
subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (C) the Per Purchaser Share Value, by (y) the Assumed Option
Spread Value Per Share, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Contingent
Assumed Options;

(ii) upon the payment of any cash Earn-Out Consideration, the Purchaser shall
release such number of Contingent Assumed Options exercisable for a number of
Purchaser Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Earn-Out Cash Amount by (B) the
total number of shares subject to such Unvested Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Assumed Option Spread Value Per Share, rounded
down to the nearest whole number of Contingent Assumed Options;

 



76 (iii) upon the payment of any Earn-Out Consideration in Purchaser Shares, the
Purchaser shall release such number of Contingent Assumed Options exercisable
for a number of Purchaser Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Earn-Out Stock
Amount by (B) the total number of shares subject to such Unvested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (C) the Per Purchaser
Share Value, by (y) the Assumed Option Spread Value Per Share, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of Contingent Assumed Options;

(iv) upon the payment of any Final Working Capital Payment Amount, the
Purchaser shall release such number of Contingent Assumed Options exercisable
for a number of Purchaser Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Working Capital
Payment Amount by (B) the total number of shares subject to such Unvested
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Assumed Option
Spread Value Per Share, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Contingent
Assumed Options; and 

(v) upon the release of any funds from the Holder Representative Fund, the
Purchaser shall release such number of Contingent Assumed Options exercisable
for a number of Purchaser Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the Per Share Representative Fund
Amount by (B) the total number of shares subject to such Unvested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Assumed Option Spread Value
Per Share, rounded down to the nearest whole number of Contingent Assumed
Options.

 

(d) Purchaser shall not release any Contingent Assumed Option to any Assumed
Option Holder that as of the applicable Scheduled Release Date: (i) has not
previously vested in accordance with the Original Vesting Requirements, and
(ii) may not possibly vest on any future date in accordance with the Original
Vesting Requirements due to the earlier termination of service of such
Assumed Option Holder (such Contingent Assumed Options are " _Non-Releasable
Options_ "). Any Contingent Assumed Option that has not been released to the
Assumed Option Holder as of the last Scheduled Release Date under  _Section
6.11(c)_ above shall be a Non-Releasable Option. Any Non-Releasable Options
shall immediately terminate in accordance with their terms, and the Assumed
Option Holder shall not receive any payment or other consideration in
respect of such terminated Non-Releasable Options.

_Section 6.12_ _Form S-8_. The Purchaser will (a) as soon as is reasonably
practicable (but in no event more than ten days) after the Effective Time,
file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 registering the
Purchaser Shares issuable upon exercise of the Unvested Options that are
assumed by the Purchaser under this Agreement, (b) exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such assumed Unvested Options remain
outstanding, (c) prior to the Closing Date, reserve a sufficient number of
Purchaser Shares for issuance upon exercise thereof, and (d) approve all
assumed Unvested Options for purposes of exempting such options from the
provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

_Section 6.13_ _Section 280G Matters_. No later than five Business Days
after the date hereof, the Company will deliver to the Purchaser reasonably
detailed information setting forth all persons who may be "disqualified
individuals" as described below and who may be receiving payments or benefits
in connection with the Merger (under this Agreement or any other Contract,
plan or arrangement with any Acquired Company or otherwise, including
severance payments, change of control payments and acceleration of vesting or
benefits under options or restricted stock), together with a worksheet or
memorandum reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser demonstrating the extent (if
any) to which such

 



77  payments, vesting or benefits could constitute "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. If for any reason it appears
to the Purchaser that a disqualified individual reasonably could be expected
to receive an excess parachute payment, then the balance of this _Section
6.13_ will apply, in addition to any other rights and remedies the Purchaser
may have. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to submit to a Stockholder vote or written consent
approving the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) to receive or retain any and all payments that could be
deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code, in a manner that
complies with the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the " _Stockholder
Approval Requirements_ "), including requirements that such disqualified
individual waive in advance the right to such payment if the requisite
stockholder approval is not obtained, and each such payment will be
separately approved within the meaning of such regulations. Prior to the
delivery to the Stockholders of documents in connection with the Stockholder
approval contemplated under this _Section 6.13_, the Company will provide
the Purchaser and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on all documents to be delivered to the Stockholders in connection
with the vote.

_Section 6.14_ _Employees_. Subject to any Employment Agreements to be
executed by the individuals set forth on _Schedule I_ , the employees and
independent contractors of the Acquired Companies immediately prior to the
Effective Time will remain at-will employees and independent contractors,
respectively, of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, unless otherwise determined by the Purchaser or as required by
applicable Law. The Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company will cooperate with
respect to any employee and independent contractor communications regarding
any matters provided for herein, provided that the Purchaser will retain the
sole and absolute discretion to approve of, in advance, any written employee
and independent contractor communications relating to any compensation or
benefits to be provided by it or by any Acquired Company or any other
Affiliate of the Purchaser to employees or independent contractors of
Acquired Companies under this Agreement or otherwise following the Closing.
The Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company further agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to coordinate in advance any formal meetings or
presentations between employees and independent contractors of the Acquired
Companies and any representative of the Purchaser.

_Section 6.15_ _Subsequent Monthly Financial Statements_. Until the Closing,
on or before the 30th day of each month (beginning with the April 2011
financial statements), the Company will deliver to the Purchaser unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Acquired Companies as at and for the
monthly period ending on the last day of the preceding month (the "
_Subsequent Monthly Financial Statements_ "), which will include a balance
sheet and statement of income.

_Section 6.16_ _Closing Indebtedness_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies owed to any
third party for borrowed money, including any Indebtedness under that certain
Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement between the Company
and Silicon Valley Bank and that certain Lease Agreement, by and between the
Company and De Lage Landen Financial Services, dated November 13, 2008, to be
repaid in full and shall obtain (i) payoff letters with respect to such
Indebtedness and (ii) termination statements, releases or other appropriate
evidence reasonably requested by Purchaser to the effect that no Encumbrances
against any of the Acquired Companies assets other than Permitted
Encumbrances will exist as of the Effective Time with respect to such
Indebtedness.

 



78 _Section 6.17_ _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant
to any indemnification provisions under the Governing Documents of the
Acquired Companies as in effect on the date of this Agreement and pursuant to
any indemnity agreements between any Acquired Company and any Person as in
effect on the date of this Agreement (the Persons entitled to be indemnified
pursuant to such provisions, and all other current and former directors and
officers of the Company, being referred to collectively as the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_"). The Purchaser shall cause the Governing Documents of
the Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to contain the provisions with
respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability at least as
favorable to the DandO Indemnified Parties as set forth in the Companys
Governing Documents on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Party.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable documented out-of-
pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, actually incurred by
the DandO Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this _Section 6.17_.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase and fully pay for,
including paying all premiums in advance, tail insurance providing coverage
for a period of six years after the Effective Time on the same terms as the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
indemnification maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from
or related to facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time.

(d) This _Section 6.17_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the
Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Company, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the DandO Indemnified Parties, and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make proper provision so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.17_.

 

 _Section 6.18_ _Employee Benefits_

(a) To the extent not superseded by an Employment Agreement (including any
employment agreement between any of the Purchaser, its Affiliates and the
Company, on the one hand, and any Continuing Employee, on the other hand,
entered into prior to the Effective Time), not inconsistent with _Sections
3.2_ or _6.11_ and not otherwise paid out at the Closing, the Purchaser agrees
that from and after the Effective Time, the Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor its obligations under all
Company severance and change of control plans as set forth on Section 6.18(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time. For a period of not less than
one year following the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall provide or shall
cause to be provided to the Continuing Employees compensation and employee
benefits in the aggregate that are not less favorable than those provided to
similarly-situated employees of the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not diminish any obligation of the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to any employment or similar agreement between the Company and any
employee of the Company in existence as of the Closing Date.

 



79 (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited for
eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes) with
his or her years of service with the Acquired Companies before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Plans. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject
to the terms of the New Plans and the requirements of applicable Law, the
Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods
and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee (the " _New
Health Plans_ ") to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, and the Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Health Plans_ ") ending on the date such
Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Health Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Health Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Health Plan. 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will take all actions necessary
under the Stock Option Plan (including obtaining any necessary consents and
approvals) to amend the Stock Option Plan, contingent upon and effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, to: (i) reduce the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable under the Stock Option Plan to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested Options held by
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide
that any Option that is a Vested Option and that is not, by its terms,
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 _Section 6.19_ _Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation_. Promptly after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the receipt of the requisite
shareholder approval, the Company shall duly file an amendment to its
Certificate of Incorporation substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ (the " _Charter Amendment_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware.

_Section 6.20_ _Further Assurances_. Subject to the other express provisions
of this Agreement, the Parties will cooperate reasonably with each other and
with their respective representatives in connection with any steps required to
be taken as part of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and
the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company and, after the Effective Time, the
Holder Representative agree (a) to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to each other such other documents and (b) to take
promptly, or cause to be taken (including actions after the Closing), all
actions as the requesting Party may reasonably request, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

_Section 6.21_ _Section 382 Study_. The Company will engage Ernst and Young
LLP to conduct, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
Ernst and Young LLP to complete prior to the Closing, a written study to assess
(a) whether the Company or any of its domestic Subsidiaries has undergone an
ownership change (as such term is defined by section 382(g) of the Code), and
(b) if one or more ownership changes has occurred, (i) the dates of the
ownership changes, (ii) the section 382 limitations (as such term is defined
by Code section 382(b)) applicable to the ownership changes and (iii) the
amounts and expiration dates for any net operating losses or credits that are
subject to the section 382 limitations. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary (including _Section 7.1_), satisfaction of
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.21_ shall not be a condition
precedent to the obligation of any Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and any delay in the completion of the study
for any reason shall not be a basis for any Party to delay consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



80 _Section 6.22_ _Retention Plan Participants_. Not less than five
Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide the
Purchaser with the final amount of the Retention Plan Pool and an accurate and
complete written list (the " _Retention Plan Participant List_ ") of all
Company Employees or other individuals who are or may at any time be entitled
to any payments, distributions or benefits under the Retention Plan and the
percentage interests in the Retention Plan of such Company Employees or other
individuals (which percentage interests shall, in the aggregate, equal 100%),
which the Company shall designate as the "Final Retention Plan Participant
List" when the Company provides such list to the Purchaser.

 

 _Section 6.23_ _Effective Time Holder List_. No later than 10 Business Days
prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser (with a copy to
the Holder Representative) a list of all Effective Time Holders that is, to
the Companys Knowledge, accurate and complete, indicating for each such
Effective Time Holder, (a) such Persons name and address, (b) the number of
shares of each class or series of Company Capital Stock held by such Person
and (c) the total number of Options, if any, held by such Person, indicating
(i) the number and class or series of Company Capital Stock subject to each
Option, (ii) the exercise price, date of grant, vesting schedule, and
expiration date for each Option and any applicable status as an incentive
stock option or nonqualified stock option and (iii) the total number
of Options that would qualify as Vested Options assuming all Options that are
unexercised as of the date of this Agreement remain unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Purchaser and the Exchange Agent will be entitled to rely
on the information contained in the foregoing list for purposes of effecting
the mailing required in _Section 3.3(a)(i)_.

given before or at the Closing, be terminated:

 

(a) by mutual consent of the Purchaser and the Company;

(b) by Purchaser or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated
by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on October 31, 2011 (the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to a Party whose failure to perform
any material obligation required to be performed by such Party results in the
failure of the Merger to be consummated by the End Date;

(c) by the Purchaser (so long as the Purchaser is not then in material breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement) if there has been a breach of any of the Companys
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

_Section 7.2(a_) or _Section 7.2(b_), and which breach has not been cured
within 30 days after the notice of breach from the Company;

 



83 (e) by Purchaser or the Company if (i) a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority shall have issued a final and nonappealable
Judgment, or shall have taken any other action, having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) a Law or Judgment shall be
in effect that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibits
or prevents the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued any temporary or preliminary
injunction or other Judgment having the effect of permitting the Company to
act in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by _Sections 6.5_ and
_6.9_ , or prohibiting Purchaser from taking the actions otherwise permitted
by this _Section 8.1_ or limiting the obligation of the Company to make the
payments to Purchaser contemplated by _Section 8.3_; 

(f) by Purchaser or the Company if the Stockholder Vote shall not have been
obtained within 20 days following the mailing of the consent solicitation to
the Stockholders pursuant to _Section 6.9_; provided, however _,_ that (A) a
Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(f)_ if the failure to obtain the required Stockholder Vote is
attributable to a failure on the part of such Party to perform any material
obligation required to be performed by such Party, and (B) the Company shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(f)_ if the Company has not made the payment(s) required to be made to
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ and, if applicable at the time of such
termination, pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ or _(iv)_ ; or

(g) by the Purchaser (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Stockholder Vote) if (i) there shall have occurred a Change in
Recommendation, (ii) the Company shall have failed to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Information Statement, or (iii) the Company, or
any of the Acquired Companies or any Company Representative, shall have
materially violated or breached any of the provisions set forth in _Section
6.5_ or _Section 6.9_.

 

 _Section 8.2_ _Effect of Termination_. Each Partys rights of termination
under _Section 8.1_ are in addition to any other rights it may have under
this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of such rights of termination is
not an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, this Agreement and all rights and obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement automatically end without Liability against any Party or
its Affiliates, except that (a) _Section 6.6_ ( _Confidentiality_ ),
_Section 6.7_ ( _Public Announcement_ ), _Article 11_ ( _General Provisions_
) and this _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_ will remain in full force and
survive any termination of this Agreement and (b) no such termination shall
relieve any Party of any liability for damages resulting from any willful and
material breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful
and material breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an
act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge (actual or
constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably
expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

_Section 8.3_ _Expenses; Termination Fees_

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with _Section 11.14_, whether
or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall make a nonrefundable cash payment to the Purchaser by wire transfer, in
an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all reasonable documented out-of-
pocket fees and expenses (including all reasonable

 



84  attorneys fees, accountants fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees)
paid or payable by or on behalf of the Purchaser in connection with the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and otherwise in connection
with the Merger (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ") if this Agreement is
terminated by the Purchaser or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Expense Reimbursement
shall not exceed $1,500,000 (and at no time shall the aggregate amount of any
Expense Reimbursement and Termination Fee paid by the Company exceed
$5,000,000).

 

Any Expense Reimbursement required to be made (A) as the result of a
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to  _Section 8.1(f)_
shall be paid by the Company prior to the time of such termination; and (B) as
the result of termination of this Agreement by Purchaser pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_ shall be paid by the Company within two Business Days after such
termination.

(b) The Company agrees to pay Purchaser (or its designees) by wire transfer an
amount equal to $5,000,000, less the amount of any Expense Reimbursement
previously paid by the Company to the Purchaser (the " _Termination Fee_ "),
if this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)(i)_ or _(ii)_ ;

 

(ii) by the Purchaser or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or by the
Purchaser pursuant to  _Section 8.1(g)(iii)_ and, in either case, (A) on or
before the date of any such termination a solicited or unsolicited Acquisition
Proposal shall have been announced or disclosed to the Company Board and (B) a
definitive agreement is entered into by the Company with respect to such an
Acquisition Transaction or such an Acquisition Transaction is consummated
within 12 months of such termination of this Agreement;

 

(iii) by the Purchaser or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ and (x) on
or before the 20th day after the date of the mailing of the
consent solicitation to the Stockholders pursuant to _Section 6.9_ a
solicited or unsolicited Acquisition Proposal shall have been announced or
disclosed to the Company Board, and (y) a definitive Agreement is entered into
by the Company with respect to such an Alternative Transaction or such an
Alternative Transaction is consummated within 12 months of such termination of
this Agreement; or

(iv) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ at any time during which the
Agreement was otherwise terminable by the Purchaser in a circumstance in which
the Purchaser would be entitled to payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)(i)_ or _(iii)_.

(c) Any Termination Fee required to be paid (i) pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)(i)_ shall be paid within two Business Days after termination by the
Purchaser and (ii) pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_, _(iii)_ or _(iv)_
shall be paid within two Business Days after the final event giving rise to
such payment occurs.

(d) If the Company fails to pay when due any amount payable under this
_Section 8.3_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Purchaser for all
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred
in connection with the enforcement by Purchaser of its rights under this
_Section 8.3_, and (ii) the Company shall pay to Purchaser interest on such
overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount
was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount
is actually paid to Purchaser in full) at a rate per annum equal to 3% over
the "prime rate" (as announced by The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the
date such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. 

(e) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Payment of the fees and expenses described in this _Section 8.3_
shall not be in lieu of liability pursuant to  _Section 8.2(b)_.

 



85 ARTICLE 9

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

_Section 9.1_ _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_

(a) The Acquired Companies will prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies due
before Closing (taking into account applicable extensions). Such Tax Returns
will be prepared using accounting methods and other practices that are
consistent with those used by the Acquired Companies in their prior Tax
Returns. The Acquired Companies will timely pay, or cause to be paid, (i) all
Taxes required to be shown on such Tax Returns, and (ii) all other Taxes due
before the Closing Date regardless of whether or not such Taxes are required
to be shown on a Tax Return that is due before Closing Date.

(b) Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation will prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies due on or after Closing.

(c) Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to the Holder Representative a draft of any Tax Return (or
portion thereof) of the Acquired Companies prepared (or caused to be
prepared) by Purchaser not less than 30 days prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return (and if delivery of such Tax Returns at least 30 days prior to
the due date for filing cannot be accomplished with commercially
reasonable efforts, Purchaser shall in any case deliver such Tax Returns as
soon as practicable thereafter and in any event prior to the due date for
filing), but only to the extent such Tax Return (or portion thereof) includes
or reasonably could be expected to affect Retained Taxes for which the
Effective Time Holders are liable under this Agreement. The Holder
Representative will provide Purchaser with its comments on, and proposed
changes to, such Tax Return, if any, not later than 15 days after delivery by
the Purchaser (or as soon as practicable after delivery and, if practicable,
prior to the due date for filing in the event delivery is less than 15 days
prior to the due date for filing). Purchaser will accept each such comment
and proposed change unless, after a reasonable good faith determination, it
determines that (i) there is insufficient legal authority to conclude that
such comment or change is more likely than not correct, or (ii) such comment
or proposed change would reasonably be expected to increase the amount of the
Assumed Taxes. The amount of the Retained Taxes due with respect to such a Tax
Return will be paid by the Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Purchaser shall have the right to make an Indemnification Claim for the
amount of such Retained Taxes in accordance with the provisions set forth in
_Article 10_. Nothing in this _Section 9.1(c_) will require Purchaser to
provide the Holder Representative or any Effective Time Holder any Tax Return
of Purchaser or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), including
any consolidated Tax Return of which the Company is a member but not the
common parent, provided that if any such Tax Return contains an item which
would reasonably be expected to affect Retained Taxes, Purchaser will provide
to the Holder Representative a description of such amount and how it was
determined in reasonably sufficient detail to enable the
Holder Representative to ascertain whether such amount is a Retained Tax.

_Section 9.2_ _Apportionment and Straddle Period Taxes_

(a) With respect to any Straddle Period, the Purchaser, the Acquired Companies
and the Effective Time Holders will, to the extent permitted by Law, elect to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of the Company
and will apportion any Taxes arising out of, or relating to, a Straddle Period
to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and Post-Closing Straddle Period on a
"closing-the-books" basis as if the relevant Tax period ended at the close of
business on the Closing Date. In any case

 



86  where applicable Law does not permit the Closing Date to be treated as the
last day of the taxable period, any Taxes arising out of or relating to a
Straddle Period will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period based
on an interim closing of the books as of and including the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annualized basis (including depreciation, amortization
and depletion deductions) will be apportioned on a daily pro rata basis and
(ii) solely for purposes of determining the marginal Tax rate applicable to
income during such period in a jurisdiction in which such Tax rate depends
upon the level of income, annualized income will be taken into account.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 9.2(a_) and in the case of any property, ad
valorem or similar Taxes, the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Straddle Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Tax period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period.

 

 _Section 9.3_ _Transfer Taxes_. Sales, use, transfer, conveyance,
documentary, recording, notarial, value added, excise, registration, stamp,
gross receipts and similar Taxes incurred in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes") will be borne 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the Escrow Account;
provided, however, that Purchaser shall bear the Transfer Taxes to the extent
the Escrow Shares, cash and other property then remaining in the Escrow
Account are insufficient to cover such portion of the Transfer Taxes.
Purchaser shall file all Tax Returns required in connection with such
Transfer Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.3 shall not apply
to Capital Gains Taxes.

_Section 9.4_ _Tax Contests_

(a) The Purchaser will notify the Holder Representative in writing within 10
Business Days of receipt of written notice of any Proceeding with respect to
Taxes that reasonably could be expected to affect the Liability for Indian
Taxes (including an Indian Proceeding) or Retained Taxes of the Effective
Time Holders under this Agreement (a " _Tax Contest_ "). The Holder
Representative will notify Purchaser in writing within 10 Business Days of
receipt by the Holder Representative of written notice of any Tax Contest
involving any of the Acquired Companies, or assets held by any of the Acquired
Companies (even if such notice relates solely to Retained Taxes).

(b) The Purchaser will control any and all Tax Contests of the Acquired
Companies, including the defense and (subject to _Section 9.4(c)_) settlement
of such Tax Contest. The Purchaser will (i) keep the Holder Representative
reasonably informed of the progress of any such Tax Contest, (ii) provide the
Holder Representative copies of all written correspondence and other documents
relevant to such Tax Contest, and (iii) allow the Holder Representative to
provide reasonable input; provided, nothing in this _Section 9.4(b_) will
require the Purchaser to provide Holder Representative correspondence or other
documents which contain Tax or financial information regarding the Purchaser
or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), including
correspondence or other documents pertaining to a consolidated group of which
the Company is a member, but not the common parent, provided that if any such
correspondence or other documents contain information which would reasonably
be expected to affect the Liability for Indian Taxes or Retained Taxes of the
Effective Time Holders under this Agreement, Purchaser will provide to the
Holder Representative a description of such information in reasonably
sufficient detail to enable the Holder Representative to ascertain its effect
on such Liability of the Effective Time Holders.

 



87 (c) The Holder Representative shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense of any such Tax Contest and to employ counsel (at
the expense of and on behalf of the Effective Time Holders as provided for in
_Section 11.1_), separate from the counsel employed by the Purchaser to
participate in such defense. The Purchaser may not settle any such Tax
Contest in any manner which would adversely affect the Effective Time Holders
and shall not pay (or commit to pay) any amount with respect to the Indian
Taxes without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative (which
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that
nothing herein shall require the Purchaser to appeal or to continue to
prosecute or pursue a Tax Contest, except that, if the Holder Representative
assumes control of the Tax Contest pursuant to this _Section 9.4(c)_, then
the Purchaser shall cooperate with the Holder Representative pursuant to
_Section 9.5_ to allow the Holder Representative to appeal or to continue to
prosecute or pursue such Tax Contest. If the Purchaser does not (or notifies
the Holder Representative that it will not) timely respond to, proceed with,
or appeal any Tax Contest, the Holder Representative may assume control of
such Tax Contest (or appeal), at its own expense (on behalf of the Effective
Time Holders and subject to reimbursement, at its option, from the Escrow Fund
or as otherwise provided in _Section 11.1_). Thereafter the Holder
Representative shall control such Tax Contest (or appeal). The Holder
Representative may not settle any such Tax Contest in any manner which would
adversely affect the Purchaser and shall not pay (or commit to pay) any amount
with respect to Indian Taxes without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
If the Holder Representative has assumed control of a Tax Contest (or appeal),
the Holder Representative shall prepare all filings (other than Tax Returns)
related to such Tax Contest, keep the Purchaser reasonably informed of the
progress of such Tax Contest, provide the Purchaser copies of all written
correspondence and other documents relevant to such Tax Contest, and all Tax
Returns that reasonably would be expected to affect the Effective Time
Holders Liability for Retained Taxes or Indian Taxes that are filed after the
final resolution of the Tax Contest shall be prepared by the Purchaser and
filed consistently with the final resolution.

(d) If it is necessary to pay or deposit any Tax amount (the " _Deposit_ ")
with respect to a Tax Contest involving Indian Taxes in order to (i) allow
the Tax Contest to be pursued or (ii) avoid incurring material additional
penalties, interest or Taxes with respect to the disputed Tax, some or all of
such Deposit may, with the mutual consent of the Purchaser and the Holder
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), be funded from the Escrow Fund or from a Setoff Amount, as
applicable, _provided_ that neither the Escrow Fund nor the Setoff Amount
shall be used for a Deposit unless the Threshold has been exceeded at the time
of such funding based on claimed and unresolved, or previously agreed to,
Losses for matters subject to the Threshold (including the amount of
the Deposit). The amount of any partial or full refund of the Deposit will be
distributed to (x) the Escrow Fund if funded from the Escrow Fund and the
Escrow Fund remains in existence and is available for new indemnification
claims under  _Article 10_ , (y) the Party that funded the Deposit directly
(if not funded from the Escrow Fund or a Setoff Amount) or (z) otherwise to
the Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Effective Time Holders,
with each such Effective Time Holder receiving an amount, equal to the amount
such Effective Time Holder would have received had such partial or full refund
not been used as a Deposit. To the extent the Deposit is not refunded, it
shall be treated as payment of an indemnification claim under _Section
10.1(e)_.

_Section 9.5_ _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Purchaser, the Acquired
Companies and the Holder Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any Tax Contest. 

_Section 9.6_ _Tax Sharing Agreement_. Any tax sharing agreements or
arrangements to which any of the Acquired Companies may be a party or have
liability, excluding this Agreement, will be terminated effective as of the
Closing. After the Closing, neither the Effective Time Holders nor their
Affiliates will have any further rights or liabilities thereunder, and this
Agreement will be the sole Tax sharing agreement relating to the Acquired
Companies for all periods beginning before the Closing.

 



88 _Section 9.7_ _Indian Tax Action_. Prior to the end of the Earn-Out
Period, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates will take any action
with respect to an Indian Governmental Authority that would reasonably be
expected to result in a Proceeding with respect to Indian Taxes or a claim for
indemnification for Indian Taxes excluding those actions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 9.7_ shall prohibit the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates from (i) making a claim for indemnification of Indian Taxes
pursuant to  _Section 10.3(g)_, or (ii) filing Tax Returns, paying Taxes, or
preparing transfer pricing documentation in the Ordinary Course, or responding
to requests from a Governmental Authority for information or documentation as
part of a Proceeding for Taxes, provided that if any such actions relate to
Indian Taxes, such actions shall only be permitted to the extent such actions
are consistent with this Agreement.

 

 _Section 9.8_ _Refunds of Indian Tax_. If the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates receives a refund of any Indian Taxes prior to the termination of
the Earn-Out Period for which a payment has been made to any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for a Loss described in _Section 10.1(e)_ (whether from
the Escrow Fund or as a Setoff Amount) or if, in lieu of accepting a refund
the Purchaser or its Affiliates apply such refund to reduce Taxes that would
otherwise be payable by the Purchaser or its Affiliates, an amount equal to
such refund shall be distributed to (x) the Escrow Fund if such Loss
was funded from the Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund remains in existence and
is available for new indemnification claims under _Article 10_ , (y) the
Exchange Agent for further distribution to the Effective Time Holders, if such
Loss was a Setoff Amount, with each such Effective Time Holder receiving an
amount equal to the amount such Effective Time Holder would have received had
such amount been paid as Earn-Out Consideration, or (z) the Exchange Agent for
further distribution to the Effective Time Holders in accordance with their
Escrow Percentage Interests, if such Loss was funded from the Escrow Fund and
the Escrow Fund no longer remains in existence.

 

ARTICLE 10

 

INDEMNIFICATION

_Section 10.1_ _Indemnification by the Effective Time Holders_. In the event
that Closing occurs and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in
_Section 10.5_, each of the Effective Time Holders, on a several but not
joint basis (on a pro rata basis in accordance with such holders Escrow
Percentage Interest in the Escrow Account, except in the event of certain
circumstances described in  _Section 10.5_), will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation and the other Acquired Companies) and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants, attorneys and
other advisors and representatives (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of, relating to or resulting from
any of the following:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by or on
behalf of the Company pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(i)(E)_;

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement;

(c) subject to _Section 10.5(e)_, any indemnification, exculpation and
expense reimbursement obligations of the Acquired Companies described in
_Section 6.17_ to the extent the applicable Losses arise out of, relate to
or result from events occurring or circumstances existing on or prior to the
Effective Time and exceed the amount actually received by the Surviving
Corporation from the tail insurance policy described in  _Section 6.17(c)_
with respect to the claims made by the Surviving Corporation in accordance
with _Section 10.5(e)_ relating to such events or circumstances;

 



89 (d) Retained Taxes;

 

(e) any Final Indian Tax Amount; and

(f) any Proceedings incidental to any of the matters set forth in clauses (a)
through (e) above.

For purposes of this _Section 10.1_, any inaccuracy in, or breach of any
representation or warranty or other statement, or nonfulfillment,
nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company
and the amount of any Losses associated therewith, will be determined without
regard for any material, materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect"
qualification; _provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not apply to the
second sentence of _Section 4.5(b)_, the first sentence of _Section 4.10_ or
_Section 4.30_ (any provisions in this Agreement for which materiality or
Company Material Adverse Effect are so disregarded being referred to herein
as the " _Company Materiality Qualified Provisions_ ").

 

 _Section 10.2_ _Indemnification by the Purchaser_. In the event that Closing
occurs and subject to the limitations expressly set forth in _Section 10.5_,
the Purchaser will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Effective Time
Holders and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
consultants, attorneys and other advisors and representatives (collectively,
the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by the Company Indemnified Parties arising out of,
relating to or resulting from any of the following: 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Purchaser or the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)(ii)(D)_;

(b) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement of the Purchaser or the Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or
any nonfulfillment, nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement to be performed after the date of this
Agreement by the Surviving Corporation;

(c) the Assumed Taxes; and

(d) any Proceedings incidental to any of the matters set forth in clauses (a)
through (c) above.

For purposes of this _Section 10.2_, any inaccuracy in, or breach of any
representation or warranty or other statement, or nonfulfillment,
nonperformance or other breach of any covenant or agreement by the Purchaser
or the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, and the amount of any Losses
associated therewith, will be determined without regard for any material,
materiality, "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" qualification; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the foregoing shall not apply to _Section 5.6(b)(iii)_
(any provisions in this Agreement for which materiality or Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect are so disregarded being referred to herein as the " _Purchaser
Materiality Qualified Provisions_ ").

 



90 _Section 10.3_ _Claim Procedure_. Except as expressly set forth in
_Article 9_ insofar as it relates to Indian Taxes, all claims for
indemnification under this _Article 10_ will be asserted and resolved as
follows (provided, that in each case where the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party is, collectively, the Effective Time Holders, then in each
such case all references to such Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party, as
the case may be, in this _Section 10.3_ shall be deemed (except for
provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any
payments) to refer to the Holder Representative acting on behalf of such
Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party, as applicable):

(a) A Party that seeks indemnity under this _Article 10_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") will promptly give the party from whom indemnification is sought (an
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") notice of any matter that an Indemnified Party has
determined has given rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement,
stating the amount of any Loss, if known, or a preliminary, non-binding
estimate thereof to the extent practicable (such amount, the " _Asserted
Losses_ "), and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable
particularity, and stating with particularity the nature of such matter and
the reasonable basis for such indemnification claim (an " _Indemnification
Demand_ "). So long as the value of the Escrow Fund exceeds zero (including if
any Escrow Shares remain therein), if the Indemnified Party is the Purchaser,
the Purchaser will also deliver a copy of the Indemnification Demand to the
Escrow Agent contemporaneously with the delivery to the Holder Representative.
Subject to the time periods set forth in _Section 10.4(b)_ for making a
claim, no failure or delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in providing
such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification
obligations hereunder except to the extent of any Liability caused by or
arising out of such failure or delay.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification Demand to the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the other of such
parties a written response (the " _Response_ ") in which the party providing
the Response shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive the entire amount of the Asserted Losses; (ii) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Asserted
Losses (such portion, the " _Agreed Portion_ "); _provided_ that if the
Indemnified Party is (A) a Purchaser Indemnified Party, then the Holder
Representative and Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (so long as the
value of the Escrow Fund exceeds zero (including if any Escrow Shares remain
therein)), within three Business Days following the delivery of the Response,
a written notice executed by both such Parties instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse from the Escrow Account a number of Escrow Shares and a proportionate
amount of other property then held in the Escrow Account with an aggregate
value (with such Escrow Shares included in such disbursement valued at the
Per Purchaser Share Value) equal to the entire amount of the Asserted Losses
or the Agreed Portion, as the case may be (or, if the value of the Escrow Fund
remaining in the Escrow Account is insufficient to cover such Asserted Losses
or Agreed Portion, all of the Escrow Fund remaining in the Escrow Account) to
Purchaser, or (B) a Company Indemnified Party, Purchaser shall pay the entire
amount of the Asserted Losses or the Agreed Portion, as the case may be, in
accordance with a payment and distribution method reasonably acceptable to the
Holder Representative; or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive any of the Asserted Losses (in which case the proviso set forth in
clause (ii) above shall not apply).

(c) In the event that the Party providing a Response pursuant to _Section
10.3(b)_ shall (i) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
any of the Asserted Losses, or (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled only to the Agreed Portion of the Asserted Losses, the Holder
Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of the indemnification
claims that comprise the Asserted Losses (or the portion of the Asserted
Losses not comprising the Agreed Portion). If the Holder Representative and
the Purchaser should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall
be prepared and signed by both such Parties and, in the case of a demand for
recovery from the Escrow Account, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. If
no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation within sixty
(60) days after delivery of a Response, either the Purchaser or the Holder
Representative may submit any matter set forth in the applicable
Indemnification Demand to be heard and determined in any Delaware state or
federal court in accordance with _Section 11.12_.

 



91 (d) All payments required by the applicable court shall be made within thirty
(30) days after such court renders a final, non-appealable judgment
(including in accordance with a payment and distribution method reasonably
acceptable to the Holder Representative, if a Company Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party), or, in the event any Purchaser Indemnified Party is the
Indemnified Party (and so long as the value of the Escrow Fund exceeds zero
(including if any Escrow Shares remain therein)), a written notice executed by
the Holder Representative and the Purchaser instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse a portion of the Escrow Fund with a value (with such Escrow Shares
included in such disbursement valued at the Per Purchaser Share Value) equal
to the entire amount of any such payment required by the court to be made
by the Effective Time Holders to any Purchaser Indemnified Party (or, if the
value of the Escrow Fund remaining in the Escrow Account is insufficient to
cover such Asserted Losses or Agreed Portion, all of the Escrow Fund) will be
delivered to the Escrow Agent.

(e) The obligations and Liabilities of an Indemnifying Party under this
_Article 10_ with respect to Losses arising from Claims of any third party ("
_Third Party Claims_ ") will be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions. If an Indemnified Party receives notice of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party
prompt notice of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to direct the defense of such Third Party Claim, through counsel
selected by it and subject to the reasonable approval of the Indemnifying
Party. All costs and expenses of any such defense shall be at the Indemnified
Partys expense, to be reimbursable by the Indemnifying Party (including, if
applicable, from the Escrow Account) to the extent such costs and expenses
constitute indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnified Party hereunder. The
Indemnified Party shall conduct such defense in a commercially reasonable
manner. If the Indemnified Party fails to defend or if, after commencing
or undertaking any such defense, the Indemnified Party fails to prosecute or
withdraws from such defense, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
undertake the defense or settlement thereof. If the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such Third Party Claim in
accordance with the foregoing (the " _Controlling Party_ "), the Controlling
Party shall (i) consult with the other Party to allow such other Party to
participate in such defense at the sole expense of such other Party, (ii)
keep such other Party reasonably informed regarding such defense and (iii)
provide such other Party and his, her or its counsel with access to all
records and personnel relating to any such Third Party Claim during normal
business hours. In all circumstances, the Parties shall cooperate fully and in
good faith with each other with respect to any Third Party Claims subject to
this _Section 10.3(e)_, including, as applicable, using commercially
reasonable efforts to make available to the other Party on a reasonable basis
all such witnesses, records, materials and information available to him, her
or it or to any Effective Time Holder, in the case of the
Holder Representative, or any Purchaser Indemnified Party, in the case of the
Purchaser, relating thereto as is reasonably required. Except for the
settlement of a Third Party Claim that involves the payment of money only and
for which the Indemnified Party is totally indemnified by the Indemnifying
Party, no Third Party Claim may be settled without the written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The procedures set forth in this  _Section 10.3(e)_ shall not apply to any
Tax Contests covered by _Section 9.4_ of this Agreement.

(f) In the event that the Effective Time Holders are the Indemnifying Party
and the Holder Representative assumes the control and defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with _Section 10.3(e)_, the Holder Representative
shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow Account (to the extent
there is sufficient value in the Escrow Fund) for the reasonable documented
out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses associated with the control and defense
of such Third Party Claim that are actually incurred by the Holder
Representative in connection therewith; _provided_ that to obtain such
reimbursement from the Escrow Account, the Holder Representative must deliver
a written reimbursement request to the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent which
includes reasonable detail as to, and documentary support for, the expenses
incurred. The procedures set forth in this _Section 10.3(f)_ shall not apply
to any Tax Contests covered by _Section 9.4_ of this Agreement. 

 



92 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:

 

(i) If any Purchaser Indemnified Party receives notice that a Proceeding has
been commenced against any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to Indian
Taxes (an " _Indian Proceeding_ "), the Purchaser shall provide the Escrow
Agent and the Holder Representative prompt written notice of the existence of
such Proceeding (an " _Indian Proceeding Notice_ "), which shall state the
amount of the Indian Taxes that are subject to the Indian Proceeding, if
known, or a preliminary, non-binding estimate thereof to the extent
practicable. The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Holder Representative
and Escrow Agent in writing of any change of which it is aware in the amount
of Indian Taxes that are subject to the Indian Proceeding. The amount of
Indian Taxes set forth in the Indian Proceeding Notice, as updated by
the Purchaser from time to time in accordance with this clause (i) shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Indian Proceeding Amount_." The
Purchaser shall be entitled to submit an Indemnification Demand in accordance
with  _Section 10.3(a)_ in connection with any Indian Proceeding with the
Asserted Losses being the Indian Proceeding Amount. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, following submission by the Purchaser of
such an Indemnification Demand, the procedures set forth in _Section 10.3_
(other than this _Section 10.3(g)_) shall not apply to such Indemnification
Demand, which shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth
in  _Section 9.4_ for Tax Contests and this _Section 10.3(g)_.

(ii) If (A) an Indian Proceeding has been finally resolved in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement prior to the time of the scheduled release of the
Escrow Fund following the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date and any
indemnification amount related to such Proceeding and owed pursuant to
_Section 10.1(e)_ has not been fully satisfied from the Escrow Fund by the 18
month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Unsatisfied Amount_ "), (B) an
Indian Proceeding is pending at the time of the scheduled release of the
Escrow Fund following the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date, to the
extent the amount of the Indian Proceeding Amount exceeds (the " _Applicable
Excess_ ") the value of the Purchaser Shares (valued at the Per Purchaser
Share Value) and other property, if any, remaining in the Escrow Fund
immediately following such time to satisfy unresolved claims, or (C) an Indian
Proceeding is pending or has been finally resolved in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Purchaser reasonably concludes that due
to such pending or resolved Indian Proceeding withholding is required on a
payment of the Earn-Out Consideration, the Purchaser may reduce and
retain unpaid Earn-Out Consideration (at the time such Earn-Out Consideration
would otherwise be payable pursuant to _Section 3.7)_ by an amount equal to
the Unsatisfied Amount, the Applicable Excess or, in the case of sub-clause
(C) of this paragraph, a reasonable estimate of the required withholding
(such amount, the " _Estimated Amount_ ") (the amount so set off due to any
Unsatisfied Amount, Applicable Excess or Estimated Amount, or used as a
Deposit pursuant to _Section 9.4(d)_, the " _Setoff Amount_ "). Unless used
as a Deposit pursuant to _Section 9.4(d)_, the Purchaser shall retain any
Setoff Amount relating to any Applicable Excess or Estimated Amount until the
amount of Indian Taxes that are owed, if any, pursuant to the applicable
Indian Proceeding is finally determined (in accordance with _Section 9.4(c)_)
by the appropriate Indian Governmental Authority, including as a result of a
final resolution of a Tax Contest related to the Indian Proceeding (including
all reasonable documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all
reasonable attorneys fees, accountants fees and filing fees) of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties associated therewith, the " _Final Indian Tax
Amount_ ").

(iii) To the extent the Purchaser has paid all or any portion of the Final
Indian Tax Amount, the Purchaser shall be reimbursed for such payment of the
Final Indian Tax Amount first from the Escrow Fund (without reduction for any
other pending and unpaid claims against the Escrow Fund and with any Escrow
Shares included in such disbursement valued at the Per

 



93  Purchaser Share Value) (the " _Escrow Final Indian Tax Reimbursement_ "). To
the extent the Escrow Final Indian Tax Reimbursement is insufficient to
reimburse the Purchaser for such payment of the Final Indian Tax Amount (the
" _Applicable Escrow Final Indian Tax Reimbursement Shortfall_ "), if a Setoff
Amount has been taken previously with respect to the matters that gave rise to
such Final Indian Tax Amount, the Purchaser shall be reimbursed by such
Setoff Amount in an amount up to the Applicable Escrow Final Indian Tax
Reimbursement Shortfall. To the extent the Escrow Final Indian Tax
Reimbursement plus the reimbursement from the Setoff Amount described in the
immediately preceding sentence (or, if there has been no such prior Setoff
Amount taken with respect to the matters that gave rise to such Final Indian
Tax Amount, the Escrow Final Indian Tax Reimbursement alone) is still
insufficient to reimburse the Purchaser for such payment of the Final Indian
Tax Amount (the " _Applicable Escrow/Setoff Final Indian Tax Reimbursement
Shortfall_ "), the Purchaser shall be entitled to set off in an amount equal
to the Applicable Escrow/Setoff Final Indian Tax Reimbursement Shortfall from
future payments of Earn-Out Consideration that would have otherwise been
payable pursuant to _Section 3.7_. To the extent the Escrow Final Indian Tax
Reimbursement plus any Setoff Amount taken previously with respect to the
matters that gave rise to such payment of the Final Indian Tax Amount exceeds
such Final Indian Tax Amount, the Purchaser shall promptly distribute (or
cause to be distributed) the excess portion of the applicable Setoff Amount
in accordance with _Section 3.7_.

(iv) If (A) the Purchaser makes a payment to any Indian Governmental
Authority for any Indian Taxes and such payment is deductible or results in a
credit for U.S. federal or California state Tax purposes that reduce the
actual Tax liability otherwise payable by the Purchaser or its Affiliates by
at least $100,000 with respect to any of the three taxable years following the
taxable year of the payment of the applicable Indian Taxes (as reasonably
determined in the sole discretion of the Purchaser) and (B) any
Purchaser Indemnified Party has withheld, been indemnified for or been
reimbursed for all or portion of such payment of the Indian Taxes pursuant to
this Agreement (the " _Reimbursed Indian Taxes_ "), the Purchaser shall,
promptly after filing the applicable Tax Return reflecting such Tax
reduction, pay an amount equal to the product of (x) the amount of such Tax
reduction multiplied by (y) the ratio of (1) the amount the Reimbursed Indian
Taxes over (2) the applicable Indian Taxes , to the Exchange Agent for
further distribution to the Effective Time Holders. The Purchaser shall
provide (or cause to be provided) to the Holder Representative a written
summary of how any such Tax reduction was determined. 

(v) For U.S. income tax purposes, all Setoff Amounts shall be treated as owned
by the Purchaser, all taxable income attributable to the investment of a
Setoff Amount, if any, prior to its distribution shall be allocated to the
Purchaser for U.S. income tax purposes, and neither the Purchaser nor its
Affiliates will report any Setoff Amount as a payment to the Effective Time
Holders for U.S. income tax purposes unless and until such Setoff Amount is
distributed to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to this Agreement.

_Section 10.4_ _Survival_

(a) All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will
survive the Closing and expire at 5:00 p.m. California time on the one year
anniversary of the Closing Date, irrespective of any facts known to any
Indemnified Party at or prior to the Closing or any investigation at any time
made by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.2_ ( _Authority
and Enforceability_ ), _Section 4.3(a)(i)_ ( _No Conflict_ ), _Section 4.4_
( _Capitalization and Ownership_ ), _Section 4.13_ ( _Intellectual Property_
), _Section 4.15_ ( _Tax Matters_ ), _Section 4.16(i)_ ( _Retention Plan_
),  _Section 4.29_ ( _Brokers or Finders_ ), _Section 5.2_ ( _Authority and
Enforceability_ ),

 



94   _Section 5.3(a)(i)_ ( _No Conflict_ ), _Section 5.8_ ( _Purchaser Capital
Stock_ ) and _Section 5.11_ ( _Brokers or Finders_ ) will survive the Closing
and expire at 5:00 p.m. California time on the 18 month anniversary of the
Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and
the Company set forth in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the
Closing of the Agreement shall survive the Closing and expire at 5:00 p.m.
California time on the one year anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , all covenants directly governing the payment of the Merger
Consideration shall survive indefinitely to the extent necessary to give
effect to their terms. All other covenants shall survive indefinitely to the
extent necessary to give effect to their terms (including all covenants
relating to the payment of the Merger Consideration);  _provided_ , _however_
, the covenants set forth in _Article 9_ (other than the covenants included in
_Sections 9.4_ , _9.7_ and _9.8_ to which the first part of this sentence
shall apply) will survive the Closing and expire at 5:00 p.m. California time
on the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date.

(b) All claims for indemnification under this _Article 10_ must be asserted
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in
_Section 10.4(a_); _provided_ that no claim for indemnification by any
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under  _Section 10.1(e)_ or _10.3(g)_ may be
made against the Effective Time Holders following the end of the Earn-Out
Period, and no other claim for indemnification by any Purchaser Indemnified
Parties under this _Article 10_ may be made against the Effective Time
Holders following the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however,_ that if an Indemnified Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party,
before expiration of the applicable indemnification or survival period, an
Indemnification Demand, then the applicable indemnification obligation,
representation or warranty will survive after such time as it would otherwise
expire until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered
by such Indemnification Demand. If the claim with respect to which such
notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will promptly so notify the
Indemnifying Party.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section
and elsewhere in this Agreement for the assertion of claims and notices under
this Agreement are the result of arms length negotiation among the Parties
and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the
Parties. The Parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth
in this Section and elsewhere in this Agreement may be shorter than otherwise
provided by Law, and the Parties intend that the time periods in this
Agreement shall control.

_Section 10.5_ _Limitations on Liability_

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 10.3(g)_ and this _Section
10.5_ and subject to _Section 10.4_, if the Merger is consummated, the rights
of a Purchaser Indemnified Party to assert any Claim for Indemnification under
this  _Article 10_ against the Escrow Fund will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of a Purchaser Indemnified Party relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (other than with respect to any equitable
remedies available to any Purchaser Indemnified Party); _provided_ that for
matters described in _Section 10.3(g)_, the Setoff Amount shall, in addition
to the Escrow Fund, serve as an additional remedy for the benefit of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties and the Escrow Fund will not be the sole and
exclusive remedy for the matters described in _Section 10.1(a)_ to the extent
it relates to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.2_ (
_Authority and Enforceability_ ), _Section 4.3(a)(i)_ ( _No Conflict_ ),
_Section 4.4_ ( _Capitalization and Ownership_ ), or _Section 4.29_ (
_Brokers or Finders_ ) (the foregoing representations and warranties, the "
_Company Specified Representations_ "); _provided_ further, that (i) in no
event will any Effective Time Holders Liability to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties (when aggregated with any other Liability to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties hereunder) exceed the amount of such Effective
Time Holders portion of the Merger Consideration actually received (or, in
the case of a Setoff Amount pursuant to _Section 10.3(g)_, entitled to be
received by such Effective Time Holder), (ii) each Effective Time Holders
indemnification obligation with respect

 



95  to indemnification claims relating to a breach or inaccuracy in any Company
Specified Representation shall be on a several but not joint basis (on a pro
rata basis in accordance with such holders Aggregate Percentage Interest),
and (iii) the Purchaser Indemnified Parties must first seek reimbursement for
their Losses associated with a particular claim from the Escrow Fund to the
extent the Escrow Fund is available and sufficient to reimburse the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for the applicable Losses.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this  _Section 10.5_ and _Section 11.6_
and subject to _Section 10.4_, if the Merger is consummated, the rights of a
Company Indemnified Party to assert any Claim for Indemnification under this
_Article 10_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy of a Company Indemnified
Party relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(other than with respect to any equitable remedies available to any Company
Indemnified Party); _provided_ that (i) in no event will the Purchasers
liability for any claim under _Section 10.2(a)_ (other than any
indemnification claims relating to a breach or inaccuracy in any of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 5.2_ ( _Authority and
Enforceability_ ), _Section 5.3(a)(i)_ ( _No Conflict_ ), _Section 5.8_ (
_Purchaser Capital Stock_ ) and _Section 5.11_ ( _Brokers or Finders_ ) (the
foregoing representations and warranties, the " _Purchaser Specified
Representations_ ")) exceed $12,099,996 and (ii) in no event will the
Purchasers liability for any claim under _Section 10.2(a)_ relating to any
breach or inaccuracy in the Purchaser Specified Representations exceed
$33,000,000.

(c) The Effective Time Holders will not be obligated to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties under _Section 10.1(a)_, _Section 10.1(b)_
(solely with respect to a breach of _Section 6.4_), _Section 10.1(e)_, or
_Section 10.1(f)_ (to the extent it relates to _Sections 10.1(a)_ or
_10.1(e)_ or a claim under _Section 10.1(b)_ to the extent it relates to a
breach of _Section 6.4_) unless and until the aggregate Losses subject to
such indemnification collectively exceed $750,000 (the " _Threshold_ "),
whereupon such indemnification will be made by the Effective Time Holders with
respect to the entire amount of such Losses from the first dollar and not just
the amount of Losses that exceed the Threshold; _provided, however_ , no
claim for indemnification may be made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party under
this _Article 10_ , and no indemnification payment shall be owed to any
Purchaser Indemnified Party under this _Article 10_ , with respect to any
Loss of less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the " _De Minimis Amount_
") to the extent the claim for such Loss is based on any Company Materiality
Qualified Provision (it being understood that any Losses resulting from a
single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances shall be considered as one Loss for purposes of determining
whether the De Minimis Amount has been satisfied and it being further
understood that for any such Loss exceeding the De Minimis Amount, the
applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be eligible for indemnification,
subject to the terms, conditions and limits of this _Article 10_ , for the
entire amount of such Loss and not just the amount of Losses that exceed the
De Minimis Amount). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the Threshold shall not apply to the matters described in _Section 10.1(a)_
to the extent it relates to the Company Specified Representations or _Section
4.16(i)_ ( _Retention Plan_ ) or to any amounts payable under _Section
3.6(d)(ii)_.

(d) The Purchaser will not be obligated to indemnify the Company Indemnified
Parties under _Section 10.2(a)_, _Section 10.2(b)_ (solely with respect to a
breach of  _Section 6.4_), or _Section 10.2(d)_ (to the extent it relates
to _Section 10.2(a)_ or a claim under _Section 10.2(b)_ to the extent it
relates to a breach of _Section 6.4_) unless and until the aggregate Losses
subject to such indemnification collectively exceed the Threshold, whereupon
such indemnification will be made by the Effective Time Holders with respect
to the entire amount of such Losses from the first dollar and not just
the amount of Losses that exceed the Threshold; _provided, however_ , no
claim for indemnification may be made by any Company Indemnified Party under
this _Article 10_ , and no indemnification payment shall be owed to any
Company Indemnified Party under this _Article 10_ , with respect to any Loss
of less than the De Minimis Amount to the extent the claim for such Loss is
based on any Purchaser Materiality Qualified Provision (it being understood
that any Losses resulting from a single claim or aggregated claims arising
out of the same facts, events or

 



96  circumstances shall be considered as one Loss for purposes of determining
whether the De Minimis Amount has been satisfied and it being further
understood that for any such Loss exceeding the De Minimis Amount, the
applicable Company Indemnified Party shall be eligible for indemnification,
subject to the terms, conditions and limits of this _Article 10_ , for the
entire amount of such Loss and not just the amount of Losses that exceed the
De Minimis Amount). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the Threshold shall not apply to the matters described in _Section 10.2(a)_
to the extent it relates to the Purchaser Specified Representations or to
any amounts payable under _Section 3.6(d)(i)_.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement: (i) nothing in
this Agreement will limit the Liability of a Person to another Person for his,
her or its own fraud or willful and intentional misrepresentation; (ii) the
indemnification amount with respect to each Loss incurred or suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Company Indemnified Parties, as the case
may be, will be reduced by any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments,
contribution payments or reimbursements that are received or receivable by
such Person or any of such Persons Affiliates in connection with such Loss
or the circumstances giving rise thereto; _provided_ that any reduction in
respect of insurance proceeds received shall be offset by the net present
value of any increases in premiums directly or indirectly resulting from
insurance claims associated therewith; and (iii) no indemnification claim can
be made under _Article 10_ for the amount of any Losses that were included for
purposes of calculating the Closing Net Working Capital or with respect to
any litigation or deferred billing-related matters for which specific
adjustments have been agreed to among the Parties and specified in _Schedule
II_. Prior to any Purchaser Indemnified Party receiving a payment or other
distribution in respect of any Indemnification Demand pursuant to _Section
10.1(c)_, the Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
submit the applicable claim for indemnification, exculpation or
expense reimbursement described in _Section 6.17_ being made by a DandO
Indemnified Party (the " _Applicable D andO Claim_") to the insurance carrier of
the tail insurance policy described in _Section 6.17(c)_ and to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such insurance carrier to accept,
process and pay such claim. If, despite the use of such commercially
reasonable efforts by the Surviving Corporation, such insurance carrier
notifies the Surviving Corporation that it has rejected such claim or
otherwise found that less than the full amount of such claim is covered by the
tail insurance policy, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the Holder
Representative thereof, and thereafter the Purchaser Indemnified Parties will
be entitled to payment for the amount of indemnifiable Losses relating to the
previously-delivered Indemnification Demand associated with the Applicable DandO
Claim that were not recovered by the Surviving Corporation from such
insurance carrier.

_Section 10.6_ _No Right of Indemnification or Contribution_. Except as
specified in  _Section 10.2(b)_, no Effective Time Holder has any right of
indemnification or contribution against any Acquired Company with respect to
any breach by the Company or the Surviving Corporation of any of its
representations, warranties, statements, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation hereunder, whether by virtue of any contractual or
statutory right of indemnity or otherwise, and all claims to the contrary are
hereby waived and released.

_Section 10.7_ _Exercise of Remedies by Indemnified Parties other than the
Purchaser or the Holder Representative_. No Purchaser Indemnified Party (other
than the Purchaser or any successor or assignee of the Purchaser) is entitled
to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement, unless the Purchaser (or any successor or assignee of the
Purchaser) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim or the
exercise of any other remedy. Subject to _Section 11.6_, no Effective Time
Holder is entitled to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other
remedy under this Agreement unless (i) the Holder Representative consents to
the assertion of the indemnification claim or the exercise of any other remedy
or (ii) such Effective Time Holder is treated differently than or
disproportionately to any other similarly-situated Effective Time Holder.

 



97 _Section 10.8_ _No Setoff_. Each of the Purchaser, Merger Sub and the
Company acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates) that, except as set forth in _Section 10.3(g)_, it and its
Affiliates shall have no right hereunder or pursuant to applicable Law to, and
will not, offset any amounts due and owing (or to become due and owing) under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement to any other party hereto or thereto or
such partys Affiliates against any amounts due and owing from such other
party or such other partys Affiliates under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.

ARTICLE 11

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

_Section 11.1_ _Holder Representative_

(a) The Non-Dissenting Stockholders (by virtue of their execution of a
Transmittal Letter, their approval of the principal terms of the Merger, the
adoption of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger or
participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the
right to receive the consideration payable in connection with the Merger) and
the other Effective Time Holders (by virtue of their execution of a
Transmittal Letter and by the consummation of the Merger or participating in
the Merger and receiving the benefits thereof, including the right to receive
the consideration payable in connection with the Merger), (i) hereby agree to
receive correspondence from the Holder Representative, including in electronic
form, and (ii) shall each be deemed to have approved the designation and
appointment of, and each hereby irrevocably designates and appoints,
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Holder Representative under the
terms set forth herein, and the Holder Representative hereby accepts such
designation and appointment, and as such Effective Time Holders agent and
attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to act for and on behalf of
each Effective Time Holder to do all things the Holder Representative deems
appropriate, necessary or convenient on behalf of the Effective Time Holders
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Holder
Representative Agreement, including to give and receive notices
and communications, to accept service of process on behalf of the Effective
Time Holders, to enter into the Escrow Agreement and the Exchange Agent
Agreement and to act on behalf of the Effective Time Holders thereunder
pursuant to the powers conferred hereby, to authorize and agree to any
payments under _Sections 3.6_ , _3.7_ and _3.8_ and _Article 9_ and other
applicable provisions of this Agreement, to engage counsel and such
accountants and other advisors and incur such other expenses in connection
with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Holder Representative
Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement and any Transmittal Letter as the
Holder Representative may in his, her or its sole discretion
deem appropriate, to, after the Effective Time, take such action as the
Holder Representative may in his, her or its sole discretion (but subject to
_Section 11.4_) deem appropriate in respect of waiving any inaccuracies in
the representations or warranties of the Purchaser or Merger Sub contained in
this Agreement and the waiving of any obligation of the Purchaser, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and comply with Judgments of courts or other Governmental
Authorities and awards of arbitrators, with respect to, any Claims by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party against any Effective Time Holder or by any group
of Effective Time Holders against any Purchaser Indemnified Party, in each
case relating solely to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to take all actions that are either necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Holder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing or specifically mandated by the terms of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Holder Representative Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, or any Transmittal Letter, or other agreement between any
Purchaser Indemnified Party and any Effective Time Holder, the Holder
Representative shall have no power to settle, without the prior written
consent of the Effective Time Holders, any Claims of any kind made by any
Purchaser Indemnified Party to the extent that such settlement would result in
a liability of the Effective Time Holders exceeding the amount of liability
that could be satisfied solely by recourse to the remaining Escrow Shares in
the Escrow Account or the

 



98  amount of any setoff permitted under _Section 10.3(g)_. In the event the
Holder Representative is notified that a Purchaser Indemnified Party has made
any Claim directly against a single Effective Time Holder only (other than
with respect to such Effective Time Holders pro rata share of the Escrow
Account) but not any other Effective Time Holders, the Holder Representative
shall promptly notify such Effective Time Holder of such Claim and such
Effective Time Holder may, upon written notice to each of the Holder
Representative and the Purchaser, undertake the defense, negotiation and
settlement of such Claim. Notices or communications to or from the
Holder Representative constitute notice to or from each of the Effective Time
Holders for all purposes under this Agreement. Subject to _Sections 11.3_ and
_11.4_ , without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder
Representative shall have the full power and authority to interpret the
provisions of, or consent to any amendment to this Agreement, the Exchange
Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in its capacity as Holder
Representative. For purposes of clarification, nothing contained herein
confers upon the Holder Representative any power or authority to unreasonably
interpret the provisions of Section 11.3 or Section 11.4 on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders.

 

(b) The Holder Representative may delegate its authority as Holder
Representative to any one of the Effective Time Holders for a fixed
or indeterminate period of time upon not less than 10 Business Days prior
written notice to the Purchaser in accordance with _Section 11.2_; _provided_
that such Effective Time Holder shall have executed a written joinder to
this Agreement pursuant to which such transferee agrees to be bound by all of
the terms of this Agreement applicable to the Holder Representative. The
Effective Time Holders whose interests aggregate not less than a majority of
the Merger Consideration allocable to all Effective Time Holders (the "
_Majority Effective Time Holders_ ") may, in their sole discretion, upon 30
days prior written notice to Purchaser, remove the Holder Representative from
such position. In the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal
of the Holder Representative, a successor Holder Representative will be
elected promptly by the Majority Effective Time Holders and the Effective Time
Holders will so notify the Purchaser and the Escrow Agent (so long as the
value of the Escrow Fund exceeds zero (including if any Escrow Shares remain
therein)). Each successor Holder Representative shall have all of the power,
authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Holder Representative, and the term "Holder Representative" as used
in this Agreement includes any successor Holder Representative.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement, the
Purchaser is entitled to deal exclusively with the Holder Representative on
all matters relating to _Sections 3.6_ and  _3.7_ , _Article 9_ , _Article
10_ and the Escrow Agreement, and is entitled to rely conclusively (without
further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or purported
to be executed on behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Holder
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Effective Time Holder by the Holder Representative, as fully
binding upon such Effective Time Holder.

 

(d) The Holder Representative will incur no liability of any kind to any
Person for any action or inaction taken or failed to be taken, by the Holder
Representative or by its agents, in connection with its services as the Holder
Representative, except its or its agents willful misconduct or gross
negligence. The Effective Time Holders will severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Holder Representative and its successors and assigns, on a
several but not joint basis (on a pro rata basis in accordance with their
Escrow Percentage Interests), from and against any and all loss, liability,
damage, claim, penalty, fine, forfeiture, action, fee or expense (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel and experts and their
staffs and all reasonable expense of document location, duplication and
shipment) (collectively, " _Representative Losse_ s") arising as a result of
or incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Holder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Holder Representative Agreement, in each case as such
Representative Loss is incurred or suffered; _provided_ that in the event it
is finally adjudicated that a

 



99  Representative Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Holder Representative, the Holder
Representative will reimburse the Effective Time Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Representative Losses shall first be paid from any
proceeds remaining in the Holder Representative Fund. To the extent
the Holder Representative Fund is insufficient to cover Representative
Losses, and if not paid directly to the Holder Representative by the Effective
Time Holders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Holder
Representative from (i) the amounts in the Escrow Account otherwise
distributable to Effective Time Holders pursuant to the terms hereof and the
Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in accordance with written
instructions delivered by the Holder Representative to the Escrow Agent, or
(ii) from any Earn-Out Consideration actually payable to the Effective Time
Holders pursuant to written instructions delivered by the Holder
Representative to Purchaser; _provided_ that while this section allows the
Holder Representative to be paid from the Escrow Account and the Earn-Out
Consideration, this does not relieve the Effective Time Holders from their
obligation to (if and when the Holder Representative Fund has been
depleted) promptly pay such Representative Losses as such Representative
Losses are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Holder Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to require any of the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies after the Effective Time but other than any Effective
Time Holders that are also Affiliates of the Purchaser) to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless the Holder Representative or otherwise pay any
Representative Losses.

(e) Upon the Closing, Purchaser shall wire to the Holder Representative
an aggregate amount of Two Hundred Thousand dollars ($200,000) in cash as the
Holder Representative Fund in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)(iii)_, which
shall be held by the Holder Representative as agent and for the benefit of the
Effective Time Holders in a segregated client bank account and shall be used
for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Holder Representative
for, any third party expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses)
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Holder Representative
Agreement. The Holder Representative will hold these funds separate from its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Effective Time Holders shall
not receive interest or other earnings on the Holder Representative Fund and
the Effective Time Holders irrevocably transfer and assign to the Holder
Representative any ownership right that they may have in any interest that may
accrue on funds held in the Holder Representative Fund. The Effective Time
Holders acknowledge that the Holder Representative is not providing
any investment supervision, recommendations or advice. The Holder
Representative shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss of
principal of the Holder Representative Fund other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon as practicable following the
later of the release in full of the Escrow Shares in the Escrow Account under
the terms set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement and the
resolution of all earn-out matters, the Holder Representative shall deliver
the balance of the Holder Representative Fund to the Exchange Agent for
distribution to the Effective Time Holders. For tax purposes, the Holder
Representative Fund shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily
set aside by the Effective Time Holders at the time of Closing.

(f) Following the delivery of each Calculation Statement or Indemnification
Demand, the Holder Representative and its representatives and agents shall be
given all such access (including electronic access, to the extent available)
as they may reasonably require to the books and records of the Surviving
Corporation and access to such personnel or representatives of the Surviving
Corporation and Purchaser, including the individuals responsible for preparing
the Calculation Statement or for the matters that are the subject of
the Indemnification Demand, as the case may be, as they may reasonably
require for the purposes of resolving any disputes or responding to any
matters or inquiries raised in such Calculation Statement or Indemnification
Demand.

 



100  (g) This appointment and grant of power and authority by the Effective Time
Holders to the Holder Representative pursuant to this _Section 11.1_ is
coupled with an interest, is in consideration of the mutual covenants made in
this Agreement, is irrevocable and may not be terminated by the act of any
Effective Time Holder or by operation of Law, whether upon the death or
incapacity of any Effective Time Holder, or by the occurrence of any other
event.

Agreement must be in writing and are deemed duly delivered when (a) delivered

_Section 11.3_ _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified except in a written document signed by each Party to be
bound by the amendment and that identifies itself as an amendment to this
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that after any such adoption of this Agreement
by the Stockholders, no amendment shall be made which by Law requires further
approval of the Stockholders without the further approval of such
Stockholders. Any amendment of this Agreement signed by the Holder
Representative is binding upon and effective against each Effective Time
Holder regardless of whether or not such Effective Time Holder has in fact
signed such amendment. After the adoption of this Agreement by the
Stockholders, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no amendment that
would (i) alter the amount or kind of securities, cash, property or rights to
be received in exchange for all or any of the Company Capital Stock, (ii)
adversely affect the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
or (iii) impose any material covenant on an Effective Time Holder or any of
its Affiliates (excluding any Acquired Company) not previously contemplated
by this Agreement shall be effective without the written consent of the
Majority Effective Time Holders, including each Effective Time Holder whose
Aggregate Percentage Interest as reflected on the Merger Consideration
Spreadsheet equals or exceeds 4.4%; _provided_ that any addition, deletion or
other modification of any representations, warranties or covenants applicable
only to the Parties shall not by itself require the written consent of
any Effective Time Holders even if such addition, deletion or other
modification may indirectly, through the imposition of additional
indemnification obligations or otherwise, affect the amount of the
consideration payable to any Effective Time Holder, unless such addition,
deletion or other modification adds to, deletes all or any part of or modifies
the provisions of _Section 10.4_ (Survival) or _Section 10.5_ (Limitations
on Liability). For purposes of clarification, but without limitation, the
following shall be deemed a material covenant for purposes of this _Section
11.3_ and _Section 11.4_: (x) any covenant not to compete or covenant not to
solicit customers, employees or suppliers, (y) any covenant to amend, extend
or terminate any contractual or other relationship, or (z) any covenant to
make any out-of-pocket expenditures.

_Section 11.4_ _Waiver and Remedies_. The Parties may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of any other Party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other
Party contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, instrument or
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any
of the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party
contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver by any Party will be
valid only if set forth in a written document that is identified as an
extension or waiver and signed on behalf of the Party or Parties against whom
the waiver or extension is to be effective. Any such extension or waiver
signed by the Holder Representative is binding upon and

 



102   effective against each Effective Time Holder regardless of whether or not
such Effective Time Holder has in fact signed the extension or waiver. No
extension or waiver will apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any covenant, agreement or
condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the
written extension or waiver. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising
any right or remedy under this Agreement or any of the documents delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, and no course of dealing between the Parties,
operates as a waiver of such right or remedy, and no single or partial
exercise of any such right or remedy precludes any other or further exercise
of such right or remedy or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Except
as set forth herein, any enumeration of a Partys rights and remedies in this
Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a Partys rights and remedies
are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by law and include any
rights and remedies authorized in law or in equity. After the adoption of this
Agreement by the Stockholders, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, no waiver that would (i) alter the amount or kind of securities,
cash, property or rights to be received in exchange for all or any of the
Company Capital Stock, (ii) adversely affect the holders of any class or
series of Company Capital Stock, or (iii) impose any material covenant on an
Effective Time Holder or any of its Affiliates (excluding any Acquired
Company) not previously contemplated by this Agreement shall be effective
without the written consent of the Majority Effective Time Holders, including
each Effective Time Holder whose Aggregate Percentage Interest as reflected on
the Merger Consideration Spreadsheet equals or exceeds 4.4%; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that (i) and (ii) of this sentence shall not apply to (x) any
waivers of covenants or of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ or (y) any
action or omission of the Holder Representative consistent with the duties
and powers conferred upon the Holder Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, including the provisions of _Section 11.1_, except in each such
case as any such waiver, action or omission relates to the payment of
Merger Consideration or to the Share Issuance Requirements. For purposes of
clarification, the exception at the end of the foregoing sentence shall not
restrict the Holder Representatives ability (when acting within the duties or
powers conferred by this Agreement) to agree to waivers, settlements,
compromises and similar matters relating to Claims, including Indemnification
Demands, or to determine amounts owing pursuant to _Sections 3.6_ , _3.7_ ,
_3.8_ or _3.10_ , _Article 9_ or _Article 10_.

_Section 11.5_ _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules
and exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this
Agreement that are to be delivered at the Closing), that certain Holder
Representative Agreement by and among the Holder Representative, the Company
and certain Stockholders dated as of the date hereof (the " _Holder
Representative Agreement_ ") and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any prior understandings,
agreements or representations by or among the Parties, or any of them,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

_Section 11.6_  _Assignment and Successors; Third Party Rights_. This
Agreement binds and benefits the Parties and their respective heirs,
executors, administrators, successors and assigns, except that the Company may
not assign any rights under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser. No Party may delegate any performance of its obligations
under this Agreement, except that the Purchaser may at any time delegate the
performance of its obligations to any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as
the Purchaser remains fully responsible for the performance of the delegated
obligation. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be
construed to give any Person, other than the Parties to this Agreement,
any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except as set forth in _Section
6.17_ and except the Effective Time Holders solely with respect to (i) their
right to receive payment of Merger Consideration (after, with respect to any
Merger Consideration that is not deliverable at the Closing, the amount of
such Merger Consideration has been fully and finally determined by the Parties
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including with respect to any
determinations and calculations under _Sections 3.6_ , _3.7_ and _3.8_ and any
other determinations and calculations affecting the releases and disbursements
from the Escrow Fund and the amount of any Earn-Out Consideration) and to
bring suit in accordance with this _Article 11_ for the enforcement of any
such payment, and (ii) the consent rights specified in _Sections 11.3_ and
_11.4_.

 



103  _Section 11.7_ _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement are not affected
or impaired in any way and the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to
replace such invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under
this Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision; _provided_  that the provisions of
_Sections 6.5_ , _6.9_ , _8.1_ and _8.3_ may not be severed, as they are
integral to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and without such
provisions Purchaser would not be willing to enter into this Agreement.

_Section 11.8_ _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this
Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule are arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered
and lettered sections and paragraphs of  _Article 4_ , _Article 5_ and
_Article 7_ , as applicable. The disclosure in any section or paragraph of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as the case
may be, qualifies other sections and paragraphs in this Agreement only to the
extent it is (i) clear by appropriate cross-references that a given disclosure
is applicable to such other sections and paragraphs or (ii) reasonably
apparent that the disclosure contained in such section or paragraph of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as applicable,
contains enough information regarding the subject matter of other sections of
the Agreement as to qualify or otherwise apply to such other sections, in
which case the information disclosed shall also be deemed to be disclosed for
purposes of such other sections.

 

 _Section 11.9_ _Interpretation_. In the negotiation of this Agreement, each
Party has received or has had the opportunity to receive advice from its own
attorney. The language used in this Agreement is the language chosen by the
Parties to express their mutual intent, and no provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted for or against any Party because that Party or its
attorney drafted the provision.

_Section 11.10_ _Governing Law_. Unless any exhibit or schedule specifies a
different choice of law, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would
cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction) govern all matters
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and its exhibits and schedules
and all of the transactions it contemplates, including its validity,
interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement and any disputes or
controversies arising therefrom or related thereto.

_Section 11.11_ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage may occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. The Parties accordingly agree that, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the Parties are entitled to
seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and otherwise to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement. Each Party expressly
waives any requirement that any other Party obtain any bond or provide any
indemnity in connection with any action seeking injunctive relief or specific
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

_Section 11.12_ _Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Each Party hereby
irrevocably agrees that, all claims in respect of any dispute arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement to which it is a party
or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or entered into
in connection herewith or therewith or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will be heard 

 



104   and determined in any Delaware state or federal court. The Parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in
connection therewith. Any Party may make service on another Party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 11.2_.
Nothing in this _Section 11.12_, however, affects the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

 _Section 11.13_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IN
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

_Section 11.14_  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each Party will pay its respective direct and indirect expenses incurred by it
in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
all fees and expenses of its advisors and representatives. The Purchaser and
the Company shall each bear 50% of the out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
associated with the Section 382 study contemplated by _Section 6.21_ (which
shall be reflected in _Schedule II_ and allocated through the determination of
Closing Net Working Capital), and, with respect to the filing under the HSR
Act pursuant to  _Section 6.3(b_), the Purchaser shall each bear 100% of the
fees, costs and expenses associated with this filing. All amounts relating to
any financial, legal, accounting or other advisor, and all other transaction
fees and expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by
the Company in full on or prior to the Closing Date or will be fully accrued
as current Liabilities on the accounting records of the Acquired Companies as
of the Closing Date. If this Agreement is terminated, the obligation of each
Party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such Party
arising from any breach of this Agreement by another Party.

_Section 11.15_ _Counterparts_. The Parties may execute this Agreement in
multiple counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the
Party that signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This
Agreement is effective upon delivery of one executed counterpart from each
Party to the other Parties. The signatures of all Parties need not appear on
the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts by facsimile or
email transmission that includes a copy of the sending Partys signature(s) is
as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart in person.

_Section 11.16_ _Conflict Waiver_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members, partners,
officers, employees, and Subsidiaries that the Company is the client of Cooley
LLP (the " _Firm_ "), and not any of its individual Effective Time Holders.
After the Closing, it is possible that the Firm will represent the Effective
Time Holders, the Holder Representative and their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with (a)
the transactions contemplated herein, in the Holder Representative Agreement
or in the Escrow Agreement, or (b) the Escrow Account and any claims made
thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Purchaser and
the Company hereby agree that the Firm (or any successor) may represent the
Seller Group in the future in connection with (i) matters that may arise under
this Agreement, the Holder Representative Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or
(ii) the administration of the Escrow Account and any claims that may be made
thereunder pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Firm (or
any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the Seller

 



105   Group or any director, member, partner, officer, employee, representative,
or Affiliate of the Seller Group in connection with any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Holder
Representative Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Holder Representative Agreement, or the
Escrow Agreement. Each of the Parties consents thereto, and waives
any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each such Party shall cause
any Subsidiary thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest arising
from such representation. Each of the Parties acknowledges that such consent
and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the
Parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in
this connection.
