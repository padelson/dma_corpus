any changes to applicable mandatory provisions of the law that may occur
within the period specified in Clause 4.1.

---|--- 



    7.1 | In consideration for the Shares the Buyer shall pay to the

million two hundred eighty thousand three hundred four) shall be paid by the
Buyer on 31 July 2012 ("Third Installment"); 
---|---|--- 



     | (the First Installment, the Second Installment and the Third

an "Installment"). 
---|--- 



   7.3 |

The Buyer shall pay the First Installment on the Completion Date, to the
Account, in full, without any deduction, withholding or set-off
whatsoever. Unless the Buyer pays the Second Installment or the Third
Installment to the Account, in full, without any deduction, withholding or
set-off whatsoever on or before the due date of the relevant Installment, the
payment of such Installments shall be effected by way of the Seller drawing
on the relevant Bank Guarantee that was issued by the Buyer with regard to the
relevant Installment in accordance with Clause 7.6 on or after the due date of
the relevant Installment. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer irrevocably
waives and surrenders all present and future rights and privileges, it has or
may have, to make any deductions, withholdings, cut-offs, set-offs, or
withhold its payment in any other manner. Without limitation to
the generality of the foregoing, the Buyer in particular shall not be
entitled to make any deductions pursuant to the section 498§1 of the Civil
Code nor to deduct from the Price any Tax the Buyer will be, or may be,
obligated to withhold and/or pay in relation to this Agreement and/or Share
Transfer Agreement. It is expressly confirmed by the Parties that the payment
will be deemed as made only when a full amount of a given Installment is
effectively credited to the Account. When the Buyer, or 

---|--- 
 



Page 22 of 38   the bank which issued the Bank Guarantee, is obligated by the mandatory
provisions of the law or any banking and/or other internal regulations to
decrease the Price by any amount of Tax or any other fees whatsoever
(including bank fees) in such case the Buyer shall increase the Prices, so the
amounts effectively credited to the Account are not lower than amounts
specified in Clauses 7.2.1 to 7.2.3. 

---|--- 
 



   7.4 | For the avoidance of doubt, the issuing of the Bank Guarantee as
specified in Clause 7.3 does not release the Buyer from its obligation to pay
the full Price and the Buyer shall remain, personally and by its all assets,
the Sellers debtor obligated to pay the Price by the dates specified in
Clauses 7.2. 
---|--- 



   7.5 | The Buyer shall pay all and any Polish Transfer Tax it will be
obligated to pay in relation to this Agreement and/or the Share Transfer
Agreement as well as fill in all and any declarations and notifications with
respective Tax Authorities.

the Third Installment, the Buyer shall no later than on the Completion Date
obtain, and deliver to the Seller, one or more bank guarantee(s)
(irrevocable, unconditional and payable upon first demand) from one or a
combination of the following banks: Deutsche Bank, HSBC or BNP Fortis with
regard to each of the Second Installment and the Third Installment (each a
"Bank Guarantee" and collectively the "Bank Guarantees"). Each such Bank
Guarantees shall remain valid until two weeks after the due date of the
relevant Installment. The Bank Guarantees shall be issued in accordance with
_Schedule 7.6_. The Buyer shall procure that the bank(s) issuing the Bank
Guarantees shall deliver a copy (scan) of a draft of such Bank Guarantees to
the Seller no later than 2 (two) Business Days prior to the Scheduled
Completion Date.

thousand two hundred eighty-eight) out of the costs of the Bank Guarantees but
not more than 50% of its costs. Such reimbursement shall be effected by way
of set-off with the Third Installment. 
---|--- 



   7.8 | The Seller may use the Bank Guarantees only to effect the payment
of the Second Installment and the Third Installment in accordance with Clauses
7.2.2 and 7.2.3 in connection with Clause 7.3. 
---|---

Page 23 of 38  enter into, execute and perform this Agreement and the Share Transfer
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder as well under the Share

---|---|--- 



     | 8.1.4 | it has obtained all the corporate authorizations for

any approvals required by law;  
---|---|--- 



     | 8.1.5 | it will have the necessary funds to pay each Installment

     | 8.1.6 | this Agreement will, when executed, constitute a valid and
binding obligation of the Buyer, enforceable against it; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.1.7 | it has performed the Due Diligence; 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.1.8 | save for the Regulatory Approval which is not issued yet,
the Buyer has all other necessary regulatory and other consents (if any) to
execute and complete the transactions contemplated herein and such execution
and completion shall not infringe any law or any obligation towards third
party, in each case binding on the Buyer; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.1.9 | it has obtained all internal approvals (such as e.g. from
the Buyers investment committee) required by the Buyer to empower it to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.1.10 | The Bank Guarantees delivered to the Seller, as provided

---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.1.11 | Share Transfer Agreement will, once signed by the Buyer
and the Seller with their signatures confirmed by a notary, constitute a valid
and binding obligation of the Buyer, enforceable against it. 
---|---|--- 



   8.2 | The Seller gives towards the Buyer the representations and
warranties as specified in _Schedule 8.2_ (hereinafter referred to as
"Sellers Representations and Warranties"). The list of Sellers
Representations and Warranties is the exhaustive list of the Sellers
representations and warranties or other assurances of any kind, and the Seller
does not provide any other warranty, in particular with regards to the status
of the Company and its business and/or its operations, and any such warranty
or liability which is implied or results from the law (if any) is hereby
excluded and disclaimed to the fullest possible extent. Without limitation to
the generality of the foregoing, the Seller makes no representation or
warranty as to the accuracy of, without limitation, information, forecasts,
estimates, projections, management presentations, information
memoranda, statements of intent or statements of opinion provided to the
Seller or its advisors on or prior to the Completion Date. For avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Clause 8.2 shall limit the obligations and undertakings
of the Seller expressly contained in the text of this Agreement and the Share
Transfer Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



Page 24 of 38  ---|--- 



   9.1 | If and to the extent any of the Sellers Representations and
Warranties is incomplete, incorrect or misleading or a Pre-Completion
Undertaking is breached (in each case a "Breach") and subject to Clause 9.4
to 9.19, the Seller shall put the Group Companies, if they are affected by
such Breach, or the Buyer, if the Buyer is affected by such Breach, within a
period of 30 Business Days of written notice by the Buyer of such Breach in
such position as the Buyer and/or any of the Group Companies (as the case may
be) would have been in had the representations and warranties given by the
Seller been complete, correct and not misleading or the Pre-Completion
Undertaking been complied with (restitution in kind). To the extent such
Breach consists in the existence of a financial liability, the Buyers right
to demand restitution in kind shall include the right to demand a full
(subject to limitations in Clause 9.4 to 9.19) indemnity with respect to such
Breach. For the avoidance of doubt, this shall not be construed to be a
contract for the benefit of a third party; only the Buyer and not the third
party shall have the right to demand the indemnification. The Buyer shall co-
operate with the Seller to such extent which is indispensible for enabling the
Seller (or its representatives and contractors) to perform such restitution in
kind, in particular shall grant the Seller access to necessary information
and contact persons. 
---|--- 



   9.2 | If restitution in kind as contemplated in Section 9.1 is
impossible or insufficient to fully (subject to limitations in Clause 9.4 to
9.19) compensate the Buyer and the Group Companies, unless and to the extent
such impossibility or insufficiency results from the Buyers failure to co-
operate with the Seller, the Seller shall pay monetary damages to the Buyer.
If restitution in kind is fully impossible, such monetary damages shall
substitute the restitution in kind; otherwise, monetary damages may be claimed
by the Buyer in addition to restitution in kind. 
---|--- 
 



   9.3 | If and to the extent that the Seller fails to provide restitution
in kind within the period set forth in Section 9.1, the Seller shall pay
monetary damages to the Buyer in such amount as would be necessary to effect
the restitution in kind. 
---|--- 



   9.4 | The Sellers aggregate liability and responsibility
(notwithstanding what the legal basis for such liability or responsibility
could be e.g. tort, contractual, breach of contract, unjustified enrichment)
for or related to Breaches of the Sellers Representations and Warranties and
of Pre-Completion Undertakings shall be limited to: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the Price with respect to the Clause 1, 2.4 and 7.1 of
Schedule 8.2 and Clause 4.4 of this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | EUR 75,758 (seventy-five thousand seven hundred fifty-
eight) with respect to Clause 9.1 of Schedule 8.2.; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | 25% of the Price with respect to other Sellers
Representations and Warranties and Pre-Completion Undertakings; 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 25 of 38  provisions of this Agreement and/or Share Transfer Agreement shall not exceed
the Price.  
---|--- 



   9.5 | The Seller shall not be liable for any single Breach of a
Sellers Representations and Warranties which results in a loss in an amount
of less than EUR 75,758 (seventy-five thousand seven hundred fifty-eight).
The Seller shall not be liable for any single Breach of a Pre-Completion
Undertaking which results in a loss in an amount of less than EUR 2,525 (two
thousand five hundred twenty-five). Breaches (i) of Clause 2.4 or Clause 9.1
of Schedule 8.2, (ii) that relate to the Tax Issue and (iii) of Clause 4.4
shall not be subject to this Clause 9.5. For purposes of this Clause 9.5, a
number of Breaches relating to one and the same or similar subject matters,
facts, events or circumstances may be aggregated and form a single Breach. 
---|--- 



   9.6 | The Seller shall not be liable for any lost profit of the Buyer. 
---|--- 



   9.7 | By the virtue of this provision, the Buyer irrevocably waives and
surrenders all its rights and privileges to pursue any claim (including claims
related to tort, breach of contract, unjustified enrichment) for any Breach
unless the Seller receives from the Buyer written notice containing reasonable
details of the matter giving rise to the claim and a good faith estimate of
the amount of the claim prior to 18 month from the Completion Date. The
Buyers rights shall not be affected or limited in any way if such good faith
estimate later proves to be incorrect. 
---|--- 



   9.8 | By the virtue of this provision, the Buyer irrevocably waives and
surrenders all its rights and privileges to pursue any claim (including claims
related to tort, breach of contract, unjustified enrichment) if and to the
extent a damage occurred as a result of Buyers failure to notify the Seller
in writing without undue delay after becoming aware of the same. 
---|--- 
 



   9.9 | By the virtue of this provision, the Buyer irrevocably waives and
surrenders all its rights and privileges to pursue any claim (including claims
related to tort, breach of contract, unjustified enrichment) to the extent
such claim could have been avoided if the Buyer had acted in a reasonably
diligent manner in attempting to lessen and mitigate such damage or its scope
(including attempting in a reasonably diligent manner to obtain a
compensation from a third party, in particular an insurance company). 
---|--- 



   9.10 | If: 
---|--- 



     | 9.10.1 | the Seller makes a payment in connection with the Breach
(the "Damages Payment"); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.10.2 | the Buyer recovers any sum in respect of the loss that
gave rise to such claim (the "Third Party Sum"); and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.10.3 | the receipt of that Third Party Sum was not taken into
account in calculating the Damages Payment; and 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 26 of 38  Payment exceeds the amount required to compensate the Buyer and, as the case
may be, the Group Companies, to the fullest extend for the loss or liability
which gave rise to the claim (such excess the "Excess Recovery"); 
---|---|--- 



     | then the Buyer shall, without undue delay on receipt of the Third
Party Sum, notify and repay to the Seller an amount equal to the lower of (i)
the Excess Recovery and (ii) the Damages Payment. 
---|--- 



   9.11 | The Buyer shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain
payment, reimbursement or restitution more than once for any one loss, damage,
deficiency or breach. For avoidance of doubt, for this purpose, all payment
and restitution made in favor of Group Companies shall be considered as made
in favor of the Buyer. 
---|--- 



   9.12 | All sums payable by the Seller pursuant to this Clause 9 and for
a Breach shall be (subject to Clauses 9.4 to 9.19) paid free and clear of all
deductions or withholdings whatsoever, save only as required by law. 
---|--- 



   9.13 | If any deduction or withholding is required by law from any
payment by the Seller, the Seller shall pay such additional amount as will,
after such deduction or withholding has been made, leave the Buyer with the
full amount which would have been received by it had no such deduction or
withholding been required to be made however in no case any amount exceeding
the limits specified in Clause 9.4.  
---|--- 



   9.14 | If any sum paid pursuant to this Clause 9 or for a Breach
(including in circumstances where any relief is available in respect of such
charge to Tax) is required to be brought into charge to Tax, then the Seller
shall pay such additional amount as shall be required to ensure that the total
amount paid, less the Tax chargeable on such amount (or that would be so
chargeable but for such relief), is equal to the amount that would otherwise
be payable however in no case any amount exceeding the limits specified in
Clause 9.4. 
---|--- 



   9.15 | The provisions of this Clause 9 apply notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement and will not be discharged or cease to have effect
in consequence of any rescission or termination of this Agreement or any
other provisions of this Agreement. However, this Clause 9 includes the
complete and the exhaustive list of all Buyers rights and remedies in case of
a Breach and all the other rights and remedies the Buyer may have in case of
a Breach are waved. 
---|--- 



   9.16 |

Except wilful breaches of Polish criminal law (such as in particular fraud) or
any other wilful misconduct causing a damage to the Group Companies or the
Buyer, the Buyer irrevocably waives and surrenders all its rights and
privileges to pursue any claim and/or complaints (or initiate any other
proceedings), in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any other act or omission related to this Agreement and/or
Companys business, legal or financial matters against any Sellers and/or
Pentas representatives, 

---|--- 
 



Page 27 of 38   advisors, employees as well nominees on the Companys supervisory board
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "Members of Personnel"). For the
avoidance of the doubt, the above-mentioned undertakings are given by the
Buyer for the benefit of each Member of Personnel and can be directly enforced
by each respective Member of Personnel. Pentas nominees on the Companys
supervisory board are Mr. Jan Evan, Mr. Adam Jarmicki and Mr. Rafał Sosna. 

---|--- 



   9.17 | In addition to Clause 9.16, the Buyer undertakes that the
shareholders meeting of the Company will, in a statutory time, i.e. as
regulated by the article 231 of the Commercial Code of Companies, grant to
all persons listed in the last sentence of Clause 9.16 the vote of acceptance
confirming the discharge of their duties (in Polish: _absolutorium_ ). 
---|--- 
 



   9.18 | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary but other than with
respect to the Tax Issue, the Buyer is not responsible for any Breach to the
extent that the existence of the Breach was fairly disclosed in the Due
Diligence Documents or the Disclosure Letter (including its attachments). 
---|--- 



   9.19 | For the avoidance of doubts, all limitations related to
submitting claims and/or the Sellers liability specified in this Agreement
are also applicable to such claims and liability under the Share Transfer
Agreement, and both this Agreement as well as Share Transfer Agreement
constitute an integral part of the Transaction Documents and should be (along
with all the other Transaction Documents) always taken collectively when
interpreting the scope and contents of the Parties rights and obligations. 
---|--- 



   9.20 | For accounting purposes only, any payment made by the Seller
under this Clause 9 shall be treated as a reduction of the purchase price paid
by the Buyer for the Shares, and, if a payment is made to a Group Company,
the relevant Group Company shall treat the payment as a payment made on behalf
of the Buyer as a contribution into the equity of the Group Company. 
---|--- 
 



   10. | CONDUCT OF CLAIMS 
---|--- 



   10.1 | If the Buyer becomes aware of any claim or potential claim by a
third party (a "Third Party Claim") after Completion which is reasonable
likely to result in a claim being made under this Agreement, the Buyer shall
as soon as reasonably practicable give notice of the Third Party Claim to the
Seller and (subject to the Buyer and the Group Companies being indemnified and
secured to the Buyers reasonable satisfaction by the Seller against all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including those of its legal
advisers, incurred in respect of that Third Party Claim) shall: 
---|--- 
 



     | 10.1.1 | ensure that the Seller is given all reasonable facilities
to investigate the Third Party Claim; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.1.2 | not (and ensure that no Group Company shall) admit
liability or make any agreement or compromise with any person, body or
authority in relation to that Third Party Claim without prior consultation
with the Seller; 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 28 of 38  to avoid, resist, dispute, appeal, compromise or defend that Third Party
Claim, and; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.1.1 | appoint lawyers proposed by the Seller and accepted by
the Buyer provided that such acceptation shall not be unreasonably denied. 
---|---|--- 
 



   10.2 | The rights of the Seller under Clause 10.1 shall only apply to a
Third Party Claim if the Seller gives notice to the Buyer in writing of its
intention to exercise its rights within 10 Business Days of the Buyer giving
notice of the Third Party Claim. If the Seller does not give notice during
that period, the Buyer shall be entitled acting reasonably to settle,
compromise, or resist any action, proceedings or claim against the Buyer, the
Company, or any Group Company out of which that Third Party Claim may arise. 
---|--- 



   10.3 | Neither the Buyer nor the Company nor any of their affiliates
shall be required to take any action or refrain from taking any action
pursuant to Clause 10.1 if the action or omission requested would, in the
reasonable opinion of the Buyer, be materially prejudicial to the business of
the Buyer or the Group Companies. 
---|--- 
 



   11. | ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS 
---|--- 
 



     | For a period of two years following the Completion Date, the Buyer
shall procure, and shall procure that the Group Companies, grant the Seller
(and its advisors and auditors), upon reasonable written request and at the
Sellers own costs, access (including the right to take copies) during working
hours to the books, accounts, records as well as any other information and
documents related to the Group Companies (including access to key personnel)
and for periods up until the Completion Date if the Seller can demonstrate
that it needs the information (i) for tax, accounting or similar reasons, in
each case that are mandatory or in line with Pentas tax, accounting or other
relevant practice in preceding years with regards to companies of Pentas
group, (ii) in the course of the Third Party Claim pursuant to Clause 10.1 or
(iii) to investigate the merits of any claim against the Sellers Guarantor
during the two months period referred to in Clause 15.6. 
---|--- 



   12. | ANNOUNCEMENTS 
---|--- 



     |

Save for any announcements required to be made by law or any stock or security
exchange regulation, neither Party shall make or issue any
public announcement or circular or disclosure in connection with the
existence or the subject matter of this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, and each of the Parties shall procure that none of
their subsidiaries shall make or issue any such public announcement or
circular or disclosure, in each case, without the prior written approval of
the other Party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
The Seller hereby approves any announcements the Buyer or any Affiliate of
the Buyer, in the reasonable 

---|--- 
 



Page 29 of 38   opinion of the Buyer, need to make to any current or future creditors of or
debt or equity investors in the Company, the Buyer or any of their Affiliates

any breach of this Agreement. 
---|--- 
 



   13.3 | Clauses 1, 5.6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 shall

---|--- 
 



   15. | BUYERS GUARANTOR; SELLERS GUARANTOR
