Section 2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Mergers (the " _Closing_
") shall occur at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern time), on the third (3rd) Business Day
after all of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and, on the Closing
Date, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) cause articles of merger
with respect to the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") to be duly executed
and filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland
(the " _SDAT_ ") as provided under the MGCL, and (ii) make any other filings,
recordings or publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub
under the MGCL or MLLCA in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at the later of the time the Articles of Merger are accepted

(not to exceed 30 days from the date the Articles of Merger are accepted for
record by the SDAT) as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and
specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time the Merger becomes
effective being the " _Effective Time_ "), it being understood and agreed that
the parties hereto shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing
Date and prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall prepare and, on the Closing

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If the consummation of the Merger prior to the consummation of
the Partnership Merger (and, therefore, the Effective Time occurring prior to
the Partnership Merger Effective Time), as is contemplated by this Agreement,
would cause any of the parties to incur a materially greater amount of
Transfer Taxes than would be incurred if the Merger were consummated following
the consummation of the Partnership Merger (and, therefore, if the Effective
Time were to occur following the Partnership Merger Effective Time), then,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and with the
written consent of Parent and the Company (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the timing of the consummation
of the Merger and Partnership Merger shall be re-ordered so that the Merger
shall occur and be consummated following the consummation of the Partnership
Merger (and, therefore, the Effective Time will occur following the
Partnership Merger Effective Time).

  



  

Section 2.4 _Organizational Documents_. Subject to _Section
6.10_, at the Effective Time, the articles of organization and limited
liability company agreement of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the articles of organization and limited
liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity, until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of such
articles of organization and limited liability company agreement. At the
Partnership Merger Effective Time, the certificate of limited partnership of
the Parent Operating Partnership and the Parent Partnership Agreement, each
as in effect immediately prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time shall
be the certificate of limited partnership and limited partnership agreement
of the Surviving Partnership, until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the applicable provisions of such certificate of limited
partnership and partnership agreement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that, for U.S.

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement be,

on _Section 2.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter be treated as the direct
purchase by Parent Operating Partnership, immediately prior to the
Partnership Merger, of each Person's Company LP Units in exchange for the
shares of Parent Common Stock set forth on _Section 2.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter; provided, that each such Person consent to such
treatment at or prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and Parent
Operating Partnership agrees to report such issuance of Parent Common Stock
consistent with this clause (ii) of _Section 2.5_ , all pursuant to Treasury

Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect

that would have otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of any such shares immediately prior to the
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of,
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal
representatives previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any then-outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall
become fully vested and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
such number of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise deliverable upon such

(assuming a fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by the per share closing price of the Parent
Common Stock on the last completed trading day immediately prior to the

Company Common Stock then-outstanding as a result of the full vesting of the
shares of Company Restricted Stock and the satisfaction of any applicable
income and employment withholding Taxes shall have the right to receive the

Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the

any other amounts or property otherwise payable or distributable to any Person

such Parent Party, Company Party, the Surviving Entity, the
Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment or distribution under the
Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision
of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by a Parent Party, a
Company Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent Party, the Company
Party, the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Partnership or the Exchange Agent,
as applicable.

bond in such reasonable and customary amount as the Surviving Entity may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with

such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

  



  

Section 3.10 _Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal

representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry Shares,
and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Partnership Units exchanged or converted pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock shall receive (aggregating for this purpose all
the shares of Parent Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive
hereunder), in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to
the product of (a) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock,
multiplied by (b) the per share closing price of Parent Common Stock on the
Closing Date on the NYSE, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.

Section 4.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The Company has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly
available basis) to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements
and documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including any amendments or
supplements thereto, from and after June 6, 2014 (collectively, the " _Company
SEC Filings_ "). Except as set forth in _Section 4.7(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented,
if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the
date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became
effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or
supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, no
Company Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Company SEC Filings (as amended,
supplemented or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and
schedules, was prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in

consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are used in the system of
internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are
recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)
transactions are executed only in accordance with management's authorization;
(2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
financial statements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to
maintain accountability for the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries; (3) access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with
management's authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared with
existing assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. The Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls, and the Company has
made available to Parent copies of any material written materials relating to
the foregoing. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by others
within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Company's principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to material information required to be
included in the Company's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.
Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any director or executive
officer of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under
the Exchange Act).

  



  

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on the
Company's most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in
the Company SEC Filings, none of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice since the most recent balance sheet
set forth in the Company SEC Filings made through and including the date of
this Agreement, (iii) described in any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

SEC Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review and the Company has not
received any comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC
Filings since June 6, 2014 which remain unresolved, nor has it received any
inquiry or information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting the
Company which has not been adequately addressed. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of all written comment letters
from the staff of the SEC received since June 6, 2014 through the date of
this Agreement relating to the Company SEC Filings and all written responses
of the Company thereto through the date of this Agreement. None of the
Company SEC Filings is the subject of any confidential treatment request by
the Company.

to be filed with any Governmental Authority (other than the SEC) will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of any applicable Law as to the
information required to be contained therein.

Section 5.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) Parent has filed with, or furnished (on a publicly available
basis) to, the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements and
documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, including any amendments or supplements
thereto, from and after October 27, 2011 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC
Filings_ "). Each Parent SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the
date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became effective
in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of
the date of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor any other
Parent Subsidiary is separately subject to the periodic reporting
requirements of the Exchange Act.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained or
incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Filings (as amended,
supplemented or restated, if applicable), including the related notes and
schedules, was prepared (except as indicated in the notes thereto) in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated, and each such consolidated financial statement presented fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows of Parent and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and for the
respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

  



    

 | 52| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries that are used in the system of
internal accounting controls described in the following sentence are
recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or
accountants, except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on
the system of internal accounting controls. Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including that: (1)
transactions are executed only in accordance with management's authorization;
(2) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
financial statements of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and to maintain
accountability for the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries; (3)
access to such assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
authorization; (4) the reporting of such assets is compared with existing
assets at regular intervals; and (5) accounts, notes and other receivables and
inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are
implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis.
Parent's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parent's internal controls, and Parent has made available to the Company
copies of any material written materials relating to the foregoing. Parent
has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
is defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) designed to
ensure that material information relating to Parent required to be included
in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to Parent's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within those entities, particularly
during the periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act are being prepared, and, to the knowledge of Parent, such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting Parent's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in Parent's periodic reports required
under the Exchange Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary has made any prohibited
loans to any director or executive officer of Parent (as defined in Rule 3b-7
promulgated under the Exchange Act).

  



  

(d) Except as and to the extent disclosed or reserved against on
Parent's most recent balance sheet (or, in the notes thereto) included in the
Parent SEC Filings, none of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities or obligations (i) expressly
contemplated by or under this Agreement, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice since the most recent balance sheet
set forth in the Parent SEC Filings made through and including the date of
this Agreement, (iii) described in any section of the Parent Disclosure
Letter or (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



    

 | 53| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) To the knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Filings is
the subject of ongoing SEC review and Parent has not received any
comments from the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Filings since
October 27, 2011 which remains unresolved, nor has it received any inquiry or
information request from the SEC as to any matters affecting Parent which has
not been adequately addressed. Parent has made available to the Company true
and complete copies of all written comment letters from the staff of the SEC
received since October 27, 2011 through the date of this Agreement relating
to the Parent SEC Filings and all written responses of Parent thereto through
the date of this Agreement. None of the Parent SEC Filings is the subject of
any confidential treatment request by Parent.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Disclosure Documents_.

  



  

(a) None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by
or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the
time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time such document is
amended or supplemented or at the time such document is declared effective by
the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the date it is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company and Parent, at

Meeting, at the time the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC or at the
Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. All documents that Parent is responsible for
filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein,
to the extent relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or other information
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary for inclusion

shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of the Parent Subsidiaries
to, do any of the following:

  



  

(i) amend or propose to amend the Parent Charter or Parent Bylaws

such Parent Subsidiary except as provided in the Parent OPP Agreement, the
Parent Option Plan, and the Parent Restricted Stock Plan; provided, however,
that, notwithstanding the restriction on dividends and other distributions in
this _Section 6.2(c)(iii)_ , Parent and any Parent Subsidiary shall be
permitted to make distributions, including under Sections 857, 858 or 860 of
the Code, reasonably necessary for Parent to maintain its status as a REIT
under the Code and avoid or reduce the imposition of any entity level income
or excise Tax under the Code;

  



  

(iv) acquire or agree to acquire (including by merger, consolidation or
acquisition of stock or assets) any real property, corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, other business organization or any

Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  



   

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

    

 

  



  

(v) take any action that could, or fail to take any action, the
failure of which could, reasonably be expected to cause (A) Parent to fail to
qualify as a REIT or (B) any Parent Subsidiary or Other Parent Subsidiary to
cease to be treated as any of (1) a partnership or disregarded entity for

(vi) fail to maintain all financial books and records in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP (or any interpretation thereof) or make any

for Parent to continue to avoid incurring entity level income or excise Taxes
under the Code or to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code,
including making dividend or other distribution payments to stockholders of
Parent in accordance with this Agreement or otherwise.

Section 6.3 _Preparation of Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholder Meetings_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement in preliminary form (and, in
doing so, shall offer Parent reasonable opportunity to comment upon drafts),
and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form
S-4, which will include the Joint Proxy Statement as a prospectus. Each of
the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x)
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, (y) ensure that the Form S-4 complies in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, and (z) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary
to complete the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all
information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its capital
stock to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement. The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement
shall include all information reasonably requested by such other party to be
included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement,
and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the
other with copies of all correspondence between it and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4
received from the SEC and advise the other party of any oral comments with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 received from the SEC.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the
Joint Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments from the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate and provide the other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response). Parent shall advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of
the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and
Parent and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Parent shall also take any other action required to be
taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or
state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder
in connection with the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and
the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such actions.

  



  

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or
Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary
amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form
S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the information
contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company and
the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall limit the
obligations of any party under _Section 6.3(a)_. For purposes of _Section
4.8_, _Section 5.8_ and this _Section 6.3_, any information concerning or
related to the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Stockholder Meeting will
be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and (unless such information
was materially modified by the Company) any information concerning or related
to Parent or its Affiliates or the Parent Stockholder Meeting will be deemed
to have been provided by Parent.

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter
and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company
Stockholder Meeting and to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities
Act. The Company shall, through the Company Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and solicit and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Company Change
in Recommendation as permitted by _Section 6.5(b)_; provided, however, the
Company's obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be affected by any Company Change in
Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.3(c)_ , if, on a date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is
scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ that the Company Stockholder Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  



  

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Charter and
Parent Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Stockholder Meeting and
to hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall, through the
Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Parent
Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, and solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
the Parent Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 6.3(d)_ , if, on a date for which the Parent Stockholder
Meeting is scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have
the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Parent Stockholder Meeting; _provided_  that the Parent Stockholder Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than (i) 30 days after
the date for which the Parent Stockholder Meeting was originally scheduled
(excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law) or
(ii) 120 days after the record date for the Parent Stockholder Meeting.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its
obligation to submit the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in
connection with the Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval
thereof.

  



    

 | 77| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the
Parent Stockholder Meeting on the same date and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of the Company Parties, on the one hand, and Parent Parties, on the
other hand, shall, and the Company Parties and the Parent Parties shall cause
each of the Parent Subsidiaries and the Company Subsidiaries, respectively,
to, afford to the other parties and to their respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to all of their respective properties, offices, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, each of the
Company Parties and the Parent Parties shall, and the Company Parties and the
Parent Parties shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent
Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish reasonably promptly to the other
parties (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial
or otherwise) concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
parties may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company Parties nor the Parent Parties shall be required by this _Section
6.4_ to provide the other party or the Representatives of such other party
with access to or to disclose information (w) relating to the
consideration, negotiation and performance of this Agreement and related
agreements, (x) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement
with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third
party to such access or disclosure), (y) the disclosure of which would
violate any Law or duty, fiduciary or otherwise ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the withholding party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not
in violation of any Law or duty, fiduciary or otherwise) or (z) that is
subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the
maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-
client, attorney work product or other legal privilege). Each of the parties
hereto will use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the other parties that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder.

  



  

(b) Each of the parties hereto will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information,
including any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, in
confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will
otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.5 _Company Acquisition Proposals._

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement but subject to _Section 6.5(e)_  and _Section 6.5(g)_ , during the
period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m.
(New York City time) on September 22, 2016 (the " _Go Shop Period End Time_
"), the Company Parties and their respective Representatives may and shall
have the right to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, encourage
or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal, offer or other
action that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, including by way of (A) contacting third parties, (B)
broadly disseminating public disclosure or (C) providing access to the
properties, offices, assets, books, records and personnel of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries and furnishing non-public information pursuant to
(but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company has previously or concurrently
furnished, made available or provided access to such non-public information
to the Parent Parties; (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with any Person relating to, or in
furtherance of such inquiries, proposals, offers or other actions or to
obtain, an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, or refrain
from enforcing, any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; and (iv) disclose to the
stockholders of the Company any information required to be disclosed under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of this clause (iv)
such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation if
not accompanied by an express public re-affirmation of the Company
Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Go Shop Bidder_
" shall mean any Person (including its controlled Affiliates and
Representatives) that submits a proposal or offer regarding an Acquisition
Proposal not later than the Go Shop Period End Time that has not been
withdrawn and that the Company Special Committee determines prior to the Go
Shop Period End Time (or in the case of any Acquisition Proposal received
less than two Business Days before the date of the Go Shop Period End Time,
not later than two Business Days after the Go Shop Period End Time), has
resulted in, or would be reasonably expected to result in, a
Superior Proposal. No later than two Business Days after the Go Shop Period
End Time, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each
Go Shop Bidder and provide to Parent (x) a copy of any related Acquisition
Proposal made in writing and any other written material terms or proposals
provided (including, to the extent not included therein, a copy of the
acquisition agreement and any related transaction documents and financing
commitments, if any) to the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (y) a
written summary of the material terms of any related Acquisition Proposal not
made in writing (including any material terms proposed orally or
supplementally).

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except as permitted by, and subject to, _Section 6.5(d)_ ,
_Section 6.5(e)_ and _Section 6.5(g)_ , and except with respect to a Go Shop
Bidder, from and after the Go Shop Period End Time, the Company shall
not, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal,
offer or other action that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person, or furnish to
any Person other than Parent any non-public information, in furtherance of
such inquiries or to obtain an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release any Person
from or fail to enforce any standstill agreement or similar obligation to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iv) withdraw, modify or amend the Company
Recommendation in any manner adverse to the Parent Parties or fail to make
the Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement, (v) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal (any event described in clause (iv) or this clause (v),
whether taken by the Company Board or a committee thereof, a " _Company Change
in Recommendation_ "), (vi) enter into any agreement in principle,
arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement (whether binding or not)
contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or (vii) take
any action to exempt any Person from any takeover statute or
similar restrictive provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws. For
the avoidance of doubt, after the Go Shop Period End Time until the receipt
of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, Company Subsidiaries and
each of their respective Representatives may continue to take any of the
actions described in _Section 6.5(a)_ with respect to any proposals or
offers regarding any Acquisition Proposal submitted by a Go Shop Bidder on or
before the Go Shop Period End Time or with respect to any amended or modified
proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal submitted by a
Go Shop Bidder after the Go Shop Period End Time if the Company Special
Committee has determined in good faith following consultation with its
legal and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal (as may be
amended or modified) is or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ that a Go Shop Bidder shall cease to be a Go Shop Bidder
if the negotiations between the Company and such Go Shop Bidder with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal that resulted in such Go Shop Bidder becoming a Go
Shop Bidder shall have been terminated. The Company agrees that in the event
any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary takes any action
that, if taken by the Company, would constitute a material violation of this
_Section 6.5(b)_ , then the Company shall be deemed to be in violation of
this _Section 6.5(b)_ for all purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Except as permitted by, and subject to, _Section 6.5(b)_ ,
_Section 6.5(d)_ , _Section 6.5(e)_ and _Section 6.5(g)_ , after the Go Shop
Period End Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
and each of their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any
discussions, negotiations or communications with any Person (other than Go
Shop Bidders and the Parent Parties) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or potential Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person (other
than Go Shop Bidders and the Parent Parties).

  



    

 | 80| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) If, from and after the Go Shop Period End Time and prior to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or their respective Representatives receives a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal which has not been initiated, solicited,
encouraged or facilitated in violation of _Section 6.5(b)_ , and which the
Company Special Committee has determined in good faith following consultation
with its legal and financial advisors is or is reasonably expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal, the Company and Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives thereafter may take the following actions
(but only if and to the extent that the Company Special Committee determines
in good faith following consultation with its legal advisors that the failure
to do so would be inconsistent with its duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable Law: (i) furnish, make available or provide access
to non-public information with respect to the Company and Company Subsidiaries
to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and such Person's
Representatives (provided that the Company (A) concurrently or has
previously furnished, made available or provided access to such non-public
information to the Parent Parties and (B) furnishes, makes available or
provides access to such non-public information pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) participate in negotiations regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) disclose to the stockholders of the Company
any information required to be disclosed under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of this clause (iii) such disclosure shall be
deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation if not accompanied by an
express public re-affirmation of the Company Recommendation. From and after
the Go Shop Period End Time, in the event the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any of their respective Representatives receives from a Person (including
a Go Shop Bidder) or group of related Persons (x) an Acquisition Proposal or
an amended or modified proposal or offer with respect to any such Acquisition
Proposal, (y) any request for information relating to the Company or Company
Subsidiaries from a Person who informs the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that it is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal or (z) any
inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of (but in no
event more than 48 hours following) such receipt. Such notification shall
include, to the extent then known, the identity of the parties and a copy of
such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a
written description of the material terms thereof. The Company shall keep
Parent apprised on a current basis of (and in any event no later than 24
hours after) any material developments, discussions and
negotiations concerning, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request,
including by furnishing copies of any documentation and
written correspondence that supplements or amends any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, but subject to the preceding three sentences, nothing herein
shall prohibit the Company, Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from contacting in writing any Person submitting an
Acquisition Proposal (that was not the result of a violation of this _Section
6.5_ ) solely to clarify the terms of the Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Company Board (or the Company Special Committee)
informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
confidentiality agreement that would prohibit it from providing such
information to Parent.

  



  

(e) At any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its legal advisor (and based on the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee) that the failure to do so
would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, (i) upon receipt by the
Company of an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal
(whether or not from a Go Shop Bidder), make a Company Change in
Recommendation (and the Company may so terminate this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_  of this Agreement and enter into an agreement
relating to, or for the implementation of, such Superior Proposal); or (ii)
otherwise make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to a Company
Intervening Event; provided that

  



  

(A) in the case of a Company Change in Recommendation under clause (i) of
this _Section 6.5(e)_ , (1) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from the
Company's breach of its obligations under this _Section 6.5_ , and (2) the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal
and financial advisors (and based on the recommendation of the Company
Special Committee), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and, after consultation with its legal advisor, that the failure of
the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ or make a Company Change in Recommendation, as the case may be,
would be inconsistent with its duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, taking into account all adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement that may be offered by the Parent Parties pursuant to
_Section 6.5(e)(D)_ ;

  



    

 | 81| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(B) in the case of a Company Change in Recommendation under clause (ii) of
this _Section 6.5(e)_ , the Company Board has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its legal advisor (and based on the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee), that failure of the Company to make a Company
Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by the Parent
Parties pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)(D)_ ;

  



  

(C) the Company has notified Parent in writing that the Company Board
intends to make a Company Change in Recommendation or enter into an agreement
related to the Superior Proposal, attaching the most current version of such
agreement (including any amendments, supplements or modifications) to such
notice (a " _Company Change Notice_ "); and

  



  

(D) during the five Business Day period following Parent's receipt of a
Company Change Notice, the Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and,
if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its
respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, negotiate in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (1) such that in circumstances
involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the Superior Proposal ceases
to be a Superior Proposal; provided that any amendment, supplement or
modification to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition
Proposal and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ or make a Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to clause (i)
of this _Section 6.5(e)_ unless the Company has complied with the requirements
of this _Section 6.5(e)_ with respect to each such new Acquisition Proposal
including sending a Company Change Notice with respect to each such new
Acquisition Proposal (except that the new negotiation period under this
_Section 6.5(e)(D)_ shall be three Business Days instead of five Business
Days), and (2) in circumstances not involving an Acquisition Proposal, as may
be proposed by Parent

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, unless
such Company Change in Recommendation is with respect to a Superior Proposal
and the Company terminates this Agreement in accordance with _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ of this Agreement, the Company shall cause the approval of the
Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby to be submitted to a
vote of the Company's stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  



    

 | 82| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) Nothing in this _Section 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company Board or the Company, directly or indirectly, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position

any of the their respective Representatives, shall be obligated to pay or
commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or commitment or incur any
liability or other obligation to such Person (unless expressly required by a
written agreement that was entered into prior to the date hereof with such

(b) The Company Parties shall give prompt notice to the Parent

shall give prompt notice to the Parent Parties, and the Parent Parties shall
give prompt notice to the Company Parties, if, to the knowledge of such
party, the occurrence of any state of facts, change, development, event
or condition would cause, or reasonably be expected to cause, any of the
conditions to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to
be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by the Company Parties or the Parent Parties to
provide such prompt notice under this _Section 6.8(b)_ shall not constitute a

Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall
provide exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for
each Indemnitee, which is at least as favorable in scope and amount to such
Indemnitee as the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided to such Indemnitee by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time in the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws, each of the Company Subsidiaries' respective articles or certificates
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing
documents), or written agreement, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement;  _provided_ that such exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses covers actions at or prior to the Effective Time, including all
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of _Section
6.10(a)_, during the period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on

defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs
or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the
extent such Action arises out of or pertains to (x) any action or omission or
alleged action or omission in such Indemnitee's capacity as a
director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (y) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers; and (ii) pay in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action the expenses (including
attorneys' fees and any expenses incurred by any Indemnitee in connection with
enforcing any rights with respect to indemnification) of any Indemnitee upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee has not met
the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification under Maryland law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent
or the Surviving Entity (i) shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (ii) shall not have any obligation
hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee
shall promptly refund to Parent or the Surviving Entity the amount of all
such expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the
Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the
Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the coverage afforded by the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies and the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each
case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period
of time at or prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers
with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and
retentions that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Company's existing policies and with limits of liability
that are no lower than the limits on the Company's existing policies as long
as the annual premium in the aggregate does not exceed three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual aggregate premium(s) under the Company's existing
policies. If the Company or the Surviving Entity for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the
Surviving Entity shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Company's current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Company's existing
policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent shall provide, or shall cause
the Surviving Entity to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years
after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the
Company's DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier, that is no less favorable in the aggregate than the
existing policy of the Company (which may be provided under Parent's DandO
Insurance policy) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

  



  

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.10_ applies are
intended to be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of each
Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries, administrators or representatives. Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 6.10_.

any Company Subsidiary may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational
or governing documents) of any of the Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving
Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall
be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 6.10_ is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under
any such policies.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section
9.7_ to the contrary, this _Section 6.9_ shall survive the consummation of
the Mergers indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries,
and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in

guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entity's obligations
pursuant to this _Section 6.10_.

shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a

executing and delivering the Parent Reorganization Representation Letter and
Company Reorganization Representation Letter, respectively, and reporting
consistently for all federal, state, and local income Tax or other purposes.
None of Parent or the Company shall take any action, or fail to take any
action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

Section 6.12 _Dividends_. In the event that a distribution with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or the Company OP Units
permitted under the terms of this Agreement has (i) a record date prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) has not been paid as of the Effective Time, the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company OP Units, as applicable,
shall be entitled to receive such distribution from the Company immediately
prior to the time such shares are exchanged pursuant to _Article III_ of this
Agreement. In the event that the Effective Time shall occur after the
dividend record date for Parent Common Stock in the then-current
calendar month, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company OP
Units, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the
Company immediately prior to the time such shares are exchanged pursuant to
Article III of this Agreement equivalent to (i) the Company Distribution Rate

obligation on the part of any party hereto (or any Representatives
thereof), except that the provisions of this _Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ ,
_Section 8.6_ and _ARTICLE IX_ and the definitions of all defined terms

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination, in which case the non-breaching
party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in

Section 8.3 _Termination Fee._

  



  

(a) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated
_:_

_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ , an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional)
or an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not conditional)

concurrently with such termination or within 12 months following the

case whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition
Proposal referred to in the foregoing clause (A), and for purposes of this
_Section 8.3(a)(iii)_ , "50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in the definition
of Acquisition Proposal);

  



  

then, in each such case, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee
or, solely with respect to a termination by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or
_Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ , in each case in connection with the Company entering

account directed by Parent, which payment shall be made (x) within three (3)
Business Days of the Termination Date, in the case of a Termination Fee or Go
Shop Termination Fee, as applicable, payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ ;
(y) concurrently with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of,

to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , or (iii) _Section

or Termination Fee, as the case may be, the Company shall pay, within three
(3) Business Days of the Termination Date, to Parent the Parent's Expenses in
immediately available funds to an account directed by Parent, up to an

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Parent agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ , then

(i) "Go Shop Termination Fee" means $1,200,000.

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these
agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement. In the
event that the Company shall fail to pay the Go Shop Termination Fee, the
Termination Fee or Parent's Expenses or Parent shall fail to pay the
Company's Expenses, as the case may be, when due, the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, shall reimburse Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by
Parent or the Company, as the case may be (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this _Section 8.3_. Further, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ , and, in
order to obtain the payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, for the payment set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , the
Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case
may be, its reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit.
If payable, none of the Go Shop Termination Fee, the Termination Fee or the
Parent Expenses shall be payable more than once pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Company or Parent, as the case may be (the
" _Paying Party_ "), is obligated to pay the Termination Fee or the Go Shop
Termination Fee, as the case may be, to the other (the " _Fee Recipient_ "),
the Paying Party shall pay the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination
Fee, as the case may be, into escrow, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, and
(ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Fee Recipient
without causing the Fee Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)(H) or
856(c)(3)(A)(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the
Fee Recipient's independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the
event the Fee Recipient receives either (A) a letter from the its counsel
indicating that the Fee Recipient has received a ruling from the IRS
described in _Section 8.3(g)_ or (B) an opinion from the Fee Recipient's
outside counsel as described in _Section 8.3(g)_ , an amount equal to the
Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, less the
amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure the Paying Party's
obligation to pay these amounts, it shall deposit into escrow an amount in
cash equal to the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case
may be, with an escrow agent selected by the Fee Recipient and on such terms
(subject to _Section 8.3(g)_ ) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Fee
Recipient and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow by the
Paying Party shall be made by wire transfer at the time the Paying Party is
obligated to pay the Fee Recipient such amount.

  



    

 | 98| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Termination Fee or
the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, in escrow or any
portion thereof shall not be released to the Fee Recipient unless the escrow
agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the
Fee Recipient's independent certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to it without causing it
to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from the Fee Recipient's accountants revising
that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Fee Recipient, or (ii) a letter from the Fee Recipient's counsel indicating
that the Fee Recipient received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt
by it of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may
be, would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or
alternatively, the Fee Recipient's outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Fee Recipient of the Termination
Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case may be, would constitute
Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify the
Fee Recipient as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee, as the case
may be, to the Fee Recipient. The parties hereto agree to amend this _Section
8.3(g)_ and _Section 8.3(f)_ at the request of the Fee Recipient in order to
(x) maximize the portion of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination
Fee, as the case may be, that may be distributed to the Fee Recipient
hereunder without causing the Fee Recipient to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Fee Recipient's
chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section 8.3(g)_  or
(z) assist the Fee Recipient in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this _Section 8.3(g)_. The escrow agreement
shall also provide that any portion of the Termination Fee or the Go Shop
Termination Fee, as the case may be, remaining in escrow on the date that is
five years after the date the Termination Fee or the Go Shop Termination Fee,
as the case may be, was deposited into escrow shall be released by the escrow
agent to the Fee Recipient. Any costs and expenses of the escrow agent shall
be borne solely by the Fee Recipient.

  



  

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, no Termination Fee or expense
reimbursement shall be due to either party in the event of a
termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_.

Law, this Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto

similar governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval and prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
there shall not be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the
amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement
to the holders of Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in
accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval
of the stockholders of the Company or the approval of the stockholders of
Parent without such approval of such stockholders, or (b) any amendment or
change not permitted under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

to the extent an amendment, supplement, waiver or other modification of such
provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be amended,
supplement, waived or otherwise modified without the prior written consent of
the Financing Sources.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with any agreement or

such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

this Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated

deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders
of the Company Common Stock, all Transfer Taxes.

Agreement (except, in the case of termination, as set forth in _Section 8.2_
), and after such time there shall be no liability in respect thereof (except,
in the case of termination, as set forth in _Section 8.2_ ), whether such
liability has accrued prior to or after such expiration of

hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or

jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the

reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit to,
this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and
headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present
or future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be
fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect promptly the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving
Entity and the Surviving Partnership, neither this Agreement nor any rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole
or in part, by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
exhibits and schedules hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  



  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not
intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except for the provisions of _Section 6.10 _(from and after the
Effective Time), which shall be to the benefit of the parties referred to in
such section, and except that the Financing Sources shall be express third
party beneficiaries of _Sections 9.7_ , _9.8_ , _9.10_ , _9.11 _ and _9.12_
(and, in respect to the foregoing Sections, _Section 8.4_ ), each of such
Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and
the Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions
of such Sections. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
_Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other Person. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular
matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance; Non-Recourse_. The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if
available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Party (other than Parent and the Parent Operating Partnership) shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source shall have any rights or claims
against any Company Related Party (other than Parent and the Parent Operating
Partnership) in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Debt Financing
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following consummation of
the Merger, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt
Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. In addition, in no
event will any Financial Source be liable for consequential, special,
exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of profits,
business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortuous nature, in each
case, in any way related to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties
hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the Laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland.
