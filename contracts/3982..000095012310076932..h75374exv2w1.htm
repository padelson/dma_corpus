Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), Seawell Limited, a Bermuda
corporation (&#147;Parent&#148;), and Wellco Sub Company, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;).</DIV>

approved this Agreement and the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the &#147;Merger&#148;), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the &#147;DGCL&#148;);</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have determined that the
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of their

Voting Agreement, of even date herewith (the &#147;Voting Agreement&#148;), with Parent, in the form of
Exhibit&nbsp;A attached hereto; and</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (a)&nbsp;the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), (b)&nbsp;this Agreement will constitute a plan of reorganization and
(c)&nbsp;Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will each be a party to such reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code.</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,

in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
the Merger, all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger

employee benefit plan, program, policy, practice, agreement, Contract or other arrangement,
regardless of whether written, regardless of whether U.S.-based, including any &#147;employee welfare
benefit plan&#148; within the meaning of Section&nbsp;3(1) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;) (including post-retirement medical and life insurance), any

such plan is subject to ERISA), including any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section&nbsp;3(37) of
ERISA) or multiple employer plan (as defined in Section&nbsp;413 of the Code), any employment or
severance agreement or other arrangement, and any employee benefit, bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, profit sharing, vacation, stock, stock purchase, stock option, severance, change of
control, fringe benefit or other plan, program, policy, practice, agreement, Contract, or other
arrangement, regardless of whether subject to ERISA and regardless of whether funded, (i)&nbsp;that
provides benefits to (x)&nbsp;any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any trade or business, regardless of whether incorporated, which is required
to be treated as a single employer together with an entity pursuant to Section&nbsp;414(b), (c), (m)&nbsp;or

any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any liability, whether direct or indirect,
contingent or otherwise. No Company Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension plan or is subject
to Section&nbsp;302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section&nbsp;412 of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan is a

ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate which has
not been satisfied in full and no event has occurred and no connection exists that could

ERISA. The Company has provided or made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
