Pursuant to the Merger, (a) if the right provided for in Section 1.2 is not exercised, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, and (ii) the Bylaws of the Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, or (b) if the right provided for in Section 1.2 is exercised (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in the Merger to conform as nearly as possible to the certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, and (ii) the Bylaws of the Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving

 _Section 1.6_ _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation; Directors of Parent_.

   

 (a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all necessary corporate action so that upon and after the Effective Time the size of the Parent Board is increased to nine members, and four members of the Company Board selected by the Company and approved by Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the "Company Directors") are appointed to the Parent Board to fill the vacancies on the Parent Board created by such increase, it being understood and agreed that the Company Directors shall nominate, and the Parent Board shall appoint, one of the Company Directors as the Chairman of the Parent Board for a term of one year following the Effective Time. Parent, through the Parent Board and subject to the Parent Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent, shall take all necessary action to nominate the Company Directors for election to the Parent Board in the proxy statement or equivalent document relating to the first annual meeting of the stockholders of Parent following the Closing. 

 

 _Section 1.7_ _Effect on Capital Stock_.

   

 (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE I and Section 2.1, each share of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and except for any Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of this Section 1.7, either (i) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Per Share Stock Consideration") or (ii) cash in an amount equal to $4.25 (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"; each of the Per Share Cash Consideration, the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration (as defined herein), the As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration (as defined herein) and the Per Share Stock Consideration is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) "Exchange Ratio" shall mean: (i) 1.15, if the volume-weighted average sale price of the Parent Common Shares on the over-the counter list operated by the Norwegian Securities Dealer Association (the "OTC-List") for the thirty calendar days immediately prior to November 15, 2010 is in excess of NOK 20, or (ii) 1.20, if the volume-weighted average sale price of the Parent Common Shares on the OTC-List for the thirty calendar days immediately prior to November 15, 2010 is equal to or less than NOK 20. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE I and Section 2.1, each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for any Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of this Section 1.7, either (i) a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Stock Consideration multiplied by (B) the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate Number (the "As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration") or (ii) cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by (B) the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate Number (the "As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration"). The number of shares of Company Common Stock (including fractional shares) that would be issuable immediately prior to the Effective Time upon conversion of a share of Company Preferred Stock into shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations of 7% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations") governing such Company Preferred Stock is referred to herein as the "Preferred Stock Conversion Rate Number". The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, the Amendment to the Certificate of Designations attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Amendment") is approved by the requisite holders of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State as promptly as practicable thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if the Amendment is not approved by the holders of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock, then at the Effective Time, (x) all of the shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except for any Dissenting Shares) shall by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive an amount of cash and a number of Parent Common Shares that the holder thereof is entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designations, and (y) appropriate adjustment shall be made to Section 1.8 so that the "Maximum Cash Amount" is reduced by the amount of cash that the holders of the Company Preferred Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to the Certificate of Designations (and in no event shall any of the shares of Company Preferred Stock be deemed to be "No Election Shares" under Section 1.8). 

  

 (d) All of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (x) a certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or 

   ##### 

  

  

(y) non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock represented by book entry ("Book Entry Shares") shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to
receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c), and (iii) any cash to be
paid in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares in accordance with Section
2.1(e). 

   

 (e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock shall be changed or proposed to be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of the occurrence of, or occurrence of a record date with respect to, any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock dividend or distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration to provide the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Shares with the same economic effect as was contemplated by this Agreement prior to giving effect to such event. 

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. At the Effective Time, all Parent Common Shares that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and retired. 

  

 (g) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub then issued and outstanding shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

 _Section 1.8_ _Election Procedures_.

   

 (a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book Entry Shares theretofore representing shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Company Preferred Stock shall pass, only upon proper surrender or transfer of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the Exchange Agent) in such form and having such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (the "Election Form") shall be mailed together with the Proxy Statement or at such other time as the Company and Parent may agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock as of the record date for notice of the Company Special Meeting (the "Election Form Record Date"). 

  

 (b) Each Election Form submitted with respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through 

   ##### 

  

    

appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than any
holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock Election Common Shares"),
(ii) the number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect
to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration
("Cash Election Common Shares") or (iii) that such holder makes no election
with respect to such holders Company Common Stock ("No Election Common
Shares"). Each Election Form submitted with respect to shares of Company
Preferred Stock shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner through
appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Preferred Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock Election
Preferred Shares"), (ii) the number of shares of such holders Company
Preferred Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the As-
Converted Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash Election Preferred Shares") or
(iii) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holders
Company Preferred Stock ("No Election Preferred Shares"). The Cash Election
Common Shares and Cash Election Preferred Shares are referred to
collectively herein as the "Cash Election Shares." The Stock Election Common
Shares and the Stock Election Preferred Shares are referred to collectively
herein as the "Stock Election Shares." The No Election Common Shares and No
Election Preferred Shares are referred to collectively herein as the "No
Election Shares." Any Company Common Stock and any Company Preferred Stock
with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective,
properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., Houston time, on the
33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the
Company and Parent shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that constitute
Dissenting Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed to be No Election
Common Shares or No Election Preferred Shares, as the case may be. 

  

 (c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein. 

  

 (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. With respect to shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by a Certificate, an Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if accompanied by such Certificate (or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificate or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificate), together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock or 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Preferred Stock represented by such Election Form shall become No
Election Shares, and Parent shall cause the Certificates, if any,
representing Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock to be
promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form
upon written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the
Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is
properly made with respect to any or all of the applicable shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the
Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding
such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
Person of any defect in an Election Form. 

  

 (e) Within ten Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the Effective Time as practicable (and in no event more than ten Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock of rights to receive Parent Common Shares or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election Forms as follows: 

   

 (i) _Cash Election Shares Greater Than Maximum Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon the conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Merger is greater than the Maximum Cash Amount, then: 

   

 (1) each Stock Election Common Share and No Election Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and each Stock Election Preferred Share and No Election Preferred Share shall be converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration; 

   

 (2) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process (treating each Cash Election Preferred Share as representing a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate Number), a sufficient number of shares ("Stock Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger in respect of the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares equals as closely as practicable the Maximum Cash Amount, and each share of Company Common Stock that is a Stock Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and each share of Company Preferred Stock that is a Stock Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration; and 

   

 (3) each Cash Election Common Share that is not a Stock Designated Share shall be converted into the right to 

   ##### 

  

   

receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and each Cash Election Preferred
Share that is not a Stock Designated Share shall be converted into the right
to receive As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration. 

   

 (ii) _Cash Election Shares Less Than Maximum Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Merger is less than the Maximum Cash Amount, then: 

   

 (1) each Cash Election Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and each Cash Election Preferred Share shall be converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration; 

   

 (2) (A) if the aggregate cash amount that would be paid in the Merger upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares, the No Election Common Shares (assuming each such share was converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration) and the No Election Preferred Shares (assuming each such share was converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration) is equal to or less than the Maximum Cash Amount, then each No Election Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and each No Election Preferred Share shall be converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration, or (B) if the aggregate cash amount that would be paid in the Merger upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares, the No Election Common Shares (assuming each such share was converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration) and the No Election Preferred Shares (assuming each such share was converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration) is greater than the Maximum Cash Amount, then Exchange Agent shall then select from among the No Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process (treating each No Election Preferred Share as representing a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate Number), a sufficient number of shares (the "Cash Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger in respect of the Cash Election Shares and Cash Designated Shares equals as closely as practicable the Maximum Cash Amount, and each share of Company Common Stock that is a Cash Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and each share of Company Preferred Stock that is a Cash Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration; and 

   

 (3) each Stock Election Common Share and, if clause (B) of the preceding paragraph is applicable, each No Election Common Share that is not a Cash Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and each Stock Election Preferred Share and No Election Preferred Share that 

   ##### 

  

   

is not a Cash Designated Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration. 

   

 (iii) _Cash Election Shares Equal to Maximum Cash Amount_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Merger is equal to the Maximum Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply, and: 

   

 (1) each Cash Election Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration, and each Cash Election Preferred Share shall be converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration; 

   

 (2) each Stock Election Common Share and No Election Common Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, and each Stock Election Preferred Share and No Election Preferred Share shall be converted into the right to receive the As-Converted Per Share Stock Consideration. 

  

 For purposes of this Agreement, "Maximum Cash Amount" shall mean the product obtained by multiplying (x) the Per Share Cash Consideration by (y) 35% of the sum of (1) the Preferred Stock Conversion Rate Number times the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of determining the allocations set forth in this Section 1.8(e), Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to require that any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of the Election Deadline be treated as Cash Election Shares, although no such shares shall be subject to any of the pro rata selection processes contemplated by this Section 1.8(e). 

  

 (f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually determined by Parent and the Company. 

 

 _Section 1.9_ _Equity Awards_. (a) At or prior to the Election Deadline, each holder of an outstanding stock option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, including those issued under the Companys Second Amended and Restated 2006 Incentive Plan, as amended, and the 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), whether or not then exercisable or vested, and whether or not performance-based (each, a "Company Option") shall by written notice to the Company elect to receive, at the Effective Time, either cash or fully exercisable and vested options to purchase Parent Common Shares in accordance with this Section 1.9(a)(i) or (ii) below. At the Effective Time, each Company Option shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted in accordance with the election of the holder thereof

##### 

 

   

into either (i) the right to receive cash, subject to applicable withholding
Tax obligations, in an amount equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any,
of the Per Share Cash Consideration over the per share exercise price of such
Company Option multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (whether or not exercisable or vested immediately prior to
the Effective Time) or (ii) a fully vested and exercisable option to purchase
a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio (with any resulting number of shares
that contains a fraction of a share being decreased to the next whole number
of shares), at an exercise price equal to the quotient of (X) the per share
exercise price of such Company Option divided by (Y) the Exchange Ratio (with
any resulting exercise price that contains a fraction of a cent
being increased to the next whole cent), such option to otherwise have the
same terms and conditions equivalent to such outstanding Company Option;
provided, however, that each such converted option to purchase Parent Common
Shares shall retain its original expiration date notwithstanding
a termination of employment, retirement, death or disability of the holder of
the converted option to purchase Parent Common Shares. Prior to the Election
Deadline, the Company shall provide written notice to each holder of a
Company Option and instructions regarding how to make the election
as described in this Section 1.9(a) in such forms and manner as approved by
Parent whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Promptly following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent a list of all
holders of Company Options and amounts to be paid pursuant to this Section
1.9(a) and no further action shall be required by the holders of such Company
Options. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that
the conversion of any Company Options which are intended to be "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) provided for in this
Section 1.9(a) shall be effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a)
of the Code. 

   

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all restrictions on each share of restricted Company Common Stock then outstanding, including those issued under the Company Stock Plans (each, a "Company Restricted Share"), shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be deemed to have lapsed and each such Company Restricted Share shall then be deemed to be an unrestricted share of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each such unrestricted share of Company Common Stock shall be treated the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions, except that upon vesting the holder may satisfy the applicable withholding Tax obligations by payment by cash or check or by returning to the Surviving Corporation a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock equal in value to that obligation. 

  

 (c) Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreement, the performance goals under each performance share award (the "Company Performance Awards") shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be deemed to have been achieved as of immediately prior to the Effective 

   ##### 

  

    

Time, and at such time each such Company Performance Award shall be deemed to
be an unrestricted share of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
unrestricted shares of Company Common Stock represented by each
Company Performance Award shall be treated the same as, and have the same
rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common
Stock not subject to any restrictions, except that the holder may satisfy the
applicable withholding Tax obligations by payment by cash or check or
by returning to the Surviving Corporation a sufficient number of shares of
Company Common Stock equal in value to that obligation. 

  

 (d) The Company and Parent agree that prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall be permitted under this Agreement to, take all corporate action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.9, including, but not limited to, amending the terms of any Company Stock Plan, any Company Option, Company Restricted Share or Company Performance Award (collectively, "Company Equity Awards") or any award agreement evidencing such Company Equity Award. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company (other than any references relating to a "change in control" of the Company) in each Company Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any Company Equity Awards shall be deemed to refer to Parent, unless Parent determines otherwise. 

  

 (e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall take all action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance under an effective registration statement filed with the SEC a sufficient number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon exercise or vesting of an assumed Company Equity Award. 

  

 (f) As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 1.9, all rights under any Company Equity Award and any provision of the Company Stock Plans providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 1.9, no Person shall have any rights under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof. 

 

 _Section 1.10_ _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock as to which the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a "Dissenting Share"), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the "fair value" of the Dissenting Shares to the extent permitted by, and determined in accordance with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his demand for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock or 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and such shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock , as the case may be, shall
thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and if such forfeiture shall
occur following the Election Deadline, each such share of Company Common
Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest
thereon, the Per Share Cash Consideration, and each such share of Company
Preferred Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest
thereon, the As-Converted Per Share Cash Consideration. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any written demands actually received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock, and an opportunity to participate at Parents own expense in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any claim
with respect to Dissenting Shares without the written consent of Parent.

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Options, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE II, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and shares in uncertificated book entry form representing Parent Common Shares to make pursuant to this ARTICLE II all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Shares as required by ARTICLE I and sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an exchange agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such Exchange Agent to act as agent for payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this ARTICLE II from time to time after the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions consistent with the terms of this Agreement given on or prior to the Closing Date, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock, shares of Company Preferred Stock and Company Options pursuant to this Agreement, as well as the dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e), out of the Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and shares in uncertificate book entry representing Parent Common Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(e)) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund." Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to the Parent Common Shares held by it from time to time hereunder after the establishment of the Exchange Fund for the account of Persons entitled thereto. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or of any Book Entry Share (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of such shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender or transfer of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a Book Entry Share, in each case, together with such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more Parent Common Shares (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Common Shares, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company Preferred Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7 and this ARTICLE II, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c). Such shares and check shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent promptly after the surrender or transfer of Certificates of Book Entry Shares, as the case may be, by the holder of record of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock prior to the Effective Time that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive under this Agreement) may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered or, in the case of any Book Entry Share, transferred, as contemplated by this Section 2.1, each Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or transfer the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate or 

   ##### 

  

    

Book Entry Share, cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Common Shares to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c), or, with respect to any Dissenting Share, the right to demand to be
paid the amount determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL as contemplated by Section 1.10. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Parent Common Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any Certificate that has not been properly surrendered or Book Entry Share that has not been properly transferred with respect to the Parent Common Shares that such holder would be entitled to receive upon proper surrender of such Certificate or transfer of such Book Entry Share. Following surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of any such Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to such holder of Parent Common Shares issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common Shares, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender or transfer and a payment date subsequent to such surrender or transfer payable with respect to such Parent Common Shares. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends or other distributions pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if such Parent Common Shares were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock_. The Merger Consideration issued and paid upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any payments made pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock. 

  

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip of Parent Common Shares representing fractional Parent Common Shares or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or transfer of Book Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Parent Common Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Shares (after taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash rounded to the nearest whole cent (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the final per share offering price (expressed in Norwegian Kroner (NOK), or British Pounds (£), as applicable) of the Parent Common Shares in the Parent Equity Offering, (ii) the exchange rate in U.S. Dollars of one (1) NOK as of the closing date of the Parent Equity Offering, as quoted in The Wall Street Journal on the day following the closing date, and (iii) the fraction of a Parent Common Share which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.7. 

   ##### 

  

    

No cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares shall be paid to a
holder of any Certificate that has not been properly surrendered or
Book Entry share that has not been properly transferred. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent
to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment of
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Common Shares was not
separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Common
Shares. 

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any Parent Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Company Options such amounts as are required to be 

   ##### 

  

    

deducted and withheld under any provision of any Law relating to Taxes,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock or Company Options, as the case may be, in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

 

 _Section 2.2_ _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock previously represented by such Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon.

 _Section 3.9_ _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

   

 (a) Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of all the Company Benefit Plans.

No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate which has not been satisfied in full and no event has occurred and no connection exists that could result in the Company or any ERISA Affiliate incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA.

   ##### 

  

    

reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company; to the extent applicable, the Company Benefit Plans comply in all
material respects with the requirements of ERISA and the Code or with the
Laws of any applicable jurisdiction, and any Company Benefit Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS (or, if applicable, an opinion letter) and
such letter has not been revoked; all required amendments since the issuance
of such favorable determination letter from the IRS have been made and no
amendments have been made that could reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of any of such Company Benefit Plans; the Company Benefit
Plans have been maintained and operated in compliance in all
material respects with their terms; there are no pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened claims against or otherwise involving any Company
Benefit Plan (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course
of the Company Benefit Plan activities) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company; all material contributions required to be made as of
the date hereof to the Company Benefit Plans have been made; neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any material
liability, contingent or otherwise, under Title IV of ERISA that has not
been satisfied in full; and with respect to the Company Benefit Plans or any
"employee pension benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, that
are subject to Title IV of ERISA, there does not exist any accumulated
funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA, regardless of whether waived. 

  

 (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates contributes to, or has an obligation to contribute to, and has not within six years prior to the Effective Time contributed to, or had an obligation to contribute to, (i) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or (ii) any plan funded by a "VEBA" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. 

  

 (d) No Company Benefit Plan maintained by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries provides medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (regardless of whether insured) for employees or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for periods extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service other than coverage mandated by applicable Law. 

  

 (e) All accrued material obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether arising by operation of Law, Contract, or past custom, for compensation and benefits, including, but not limited to, bonuses and accrued vacation, and benefits under Company Benefit Plans, have been paid or adequate accruals for such obligations are reflected on the Company Financial Statements as of the date thereof. 

  

 (f) The execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would not (either alone or in conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment), result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, has reserved the right to amend or

terminate such plan without material liability to any Person except with
respect to benefits accrued in the ordinary course prior to the date of such

 _Section 5.3_ _Acquisition Proposals_. 

   

 (a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents and other representatives (collectively, "Representatives") not to, (i) directly or indirectly initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries with respect to, or the making or submission of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, furnish any non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their 

   ##### 

  

    

respective assets to, or provide access to the properties, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Person that has made an
Acquisition Proposal or in contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining the Company Required Vote, the Company and the Company Board may
take any actions described in clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(a) with respect
to a third party if (w) the Company has received a written Acquisition
Proposal from such third party (and such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.3(a), whether by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives), (x) the
Company gives Parent the notice required by Section 5.3(e), (y) after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors, the Company Board determines
in good faith that such proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to participate
in such negotiations or discussions or to furnish such information or data to
such third party would be likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, provided that the Company shall not
deliver any information to such third party without entering into
a confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an "Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement"), and provided further that the Company makes
available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries that is made available to any other Person or group in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously made
available to Parent as promptly as practicable after its delivery to such
Person. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any similar
disclosure, in either case to the extent required by applicable
Law; provided, however, that compliance with such rules shall not permit the
Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change other than in accordance
with Section 5.3(c) or Section 5.3(c). 

  

 (b) Except as provided herein, none of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board shall (i) withdraw or withhold (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw or withhold (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (iii) and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cause their respective officers, directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents and other representatives not to, execute or enter into any agreement, including any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, (x) relating to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in circumstances contemplated in the penultimate sentence of Section 5.3(a)) (each an 

   ##### 

  

    

"Acquisition Agreement"), or (y) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the Companys compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.6, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if (and only if) (i) a written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of Section 5.3(a), whether by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives) is made to the Company by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iv) the Company provides Parent five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (a "Notice of Acquisition Proposal"), which notice shall include the information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal that is specified in Section 5.3(e), provided that any material revisions to the Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of Acquisition Proposal and an additional two (2) Business Days following the end of such five (5) Business Day period (or any extension thereof pursuant to this proviso) provided under this Section 5.3(c), and (v) at the end of the five (5) Business Day period described in clause (iv) (including any extension of such period required thereunder), the Company Board again makes the determination in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would be likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board, in circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, from effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of Section 5.3(b) if (i) in response to a material development or change in circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable at the date of this Agreement (and which change or development does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel that not making such Adverse Recommendation Change would be likely to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in writing, at least five days in advance of such Adverse Recommendation Change, that it is considering taking such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor and (iii) during such five day period, the Company has considered and, at the reasonable request of Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding, any changes or modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that would allow the Company Board not to make such Adverse Recommendation Change consistent with its fiduciary duties. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The Company agrees that in addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof (but in any event within 24 hours after the Companys receipt thereof), the Company shall advise Parent in writing of any request for information or any Acquisition Proposal received from any Person, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the Company shall promptly provide to Parent a detailed, written summary of all of the material terms, provisions and other information set forth in any materials (including any draft agreements) received by the Company in connection with any of the foregoing and the identity of the Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the parties and price involved and any material changes to any terms and conditions thereof and detailed, written summaries of all of the material terms, provisions or other information set forth in any amended or additional documents received from or provided to any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal). The Company agrees not to release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any such agreement at the request of or on behalf of Parent. 

  

 (f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any _bona fide_ proposal (other than any proposal by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries), whether or not in writing, for the (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets that constitute 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase by any Person or group of equity securities or capital stock of any class of the Company representing 15% or more of the total voting power of the Company (or of the surviving parent entity in any such transaction) or of equity securities or capital stock of any class of any Subsidiary of the Company representing 50% or more of the total voting power of such Subsidiary if the business of such Subsidiary constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar transaction that if consummated would result in any Person or group beneficially owning equity securities or capital stock of any class of the Company representing 15% or more of the total voting power of the Company (or of the surviving parent entity in any such transaction) or equity securities or capital stock of any class of any Subsidiary of the Company representing 50% or more of the total voting power of such Subsidiary if the business of such Subsidiary constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean any written Acquisition Proposal to purchase (x) 50% or more of the outstanding equity securities of the Company pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer or merger, or (y) assets of the Company that comprise 50% or more of the revenues 

   ##### 

  

    

and assets (based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case (A) which a majority of the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors, and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory aspects
of the Acquisition Proposal, any conditions to and the expected timing of
consummation, and any risks of non-consummation, of such
Acquisition Proposal) to be more favorable to the Company and its
stockholders than the transactions contemplated hereby and any alternative
transaction or changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent
pursuant to Section 5.3(c), (B) which is reasonably likely to be consummated
on its terms and (C) which is reasonably capable of being fully financed. 

  

 (g) Immediately after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, and will instruct their respective officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall (i) take the necessary steps to promptly inform its officers, directors, investments bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken in Section 5.3(a) and (ii) request each Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Persons consideration of acquiring the Company or any portion thereof to return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in writing by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf. 

  

 _Section 5.4_ _Access to Information and Properties_. 

   

 (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives of the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other party, at such other partys sole risk and expense, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, Contracts, books, records, data and personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other parties all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other parties may reasonably request. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to review the foregoing information in a manner that does not interfere unreasonably with the operations of the other party or the other partys Subsidiaries and with the prompt discharge by such other partys employees of their duties. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to indemnify and hold the other party and the other partys Subsidiaries harmless from any and all Claims and liabilities, including costs and expenses for the injury to or death of any its representatives and any loss or destruction of any property (including Claims or liabilities for use of any property) resulting directly or indirectly from the action or inaction of any of the Company, Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, or their representatives, as applicable, during any visit to the business or property of the other party prior to the completion of the Merger, whether pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) or otherwise, other than any such Claims and liabilities arising out of or resulting from the negligence or wilful misconduct of the other party or 

   ##### 

  

    

its Subsidiaries. In addition, during such period, the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their customers, suppliers, lenders and other
creditors to be available to the other party, provided that the party seeking
access to the customers, suppliers, lenders and other creditors of the other
party shall consult with the other party prior to contacting such customers,
suppliers, lenders and other creditors and shall not contact any such
customer, supplier, lender or creditor to which the other party shall
have reasonably objected. No party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information if such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize
any attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and
Parent will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. 

  

 (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, with the prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, Parent and its authorized representatives, including engineers, advisors and consultants, lenders and financing sources, may, at Parents sole risk and expense, enter into and upon all or any portion of the Company Real Property in order to investigate and assess, as Parent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate, the environmental condition of the Company Real Property, the Company Assets or the businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent Investigation").

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, (i) the Company shall not be obligated under the terms of this Section 5.4 to disclose to Parent or its representatives, or grant Parent or its representatives access to, information that is within the possession or control of the Company or its Subsidiaries but subject to a valid and binding confidentiality agreement with a third party without first obtaining the consent of such third party, and the Company, to the extent requested by Parent, will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent, and (ii) Parent shall not be obligated under the terms of this Section 5.4 to disclose to the Company or its representatives, or grant the Company or its representatives access to, information that is within the possession or control of Parent or its Subsidiaries but subject to a valid and binding confidentiality agreement with a third party without first obtaining the consent of such third party, and Parent, to the extent requested by the Company, will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent. 

  

 (f) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement, and no party to this Agreement shall be deemed to have made any representation or warranty to the other parties except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable, file Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing. 

  

 (c) Each party shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to take any action to exempt any shareholder of the Company from any such Law. 

  

 (d) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry of, and to cause to be discharged, vacated or terminated, any order, decree, ruling or injunction precluding, restraining, enjoining, delaying or prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Furthermore, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued any order, decree, ruling or injunction, or taken any other action, that would have the effect of restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting, delaying or preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such order, decree, ruling or injunction or other action declared ineffective as soon as practicable. 

  

 (e) Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, (ii) give the other (or the others outside counsel) an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings, (iii) provide the other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) to or with a Governmental Entity relating to the Merger, and (iv) promptly provide each other with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to the Merger. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section 5.5(e) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

and/or directors of the Surviving Corporation shall take or cause to be taken
all such necessary action. 

   

 (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto will, as promptly as reasonably practicable, use their reasonable best efforts to make all necessary filings and notifications and other submissions and applications with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS") under the Exon-Florio Act. The parties shall also consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to the Exon-Florio Act. Such reasonable best efforts with respect to Parent shall not require Parent to agree, in a mitigation agreement for CFIUS approval or any other agreement with a U.S. Governmental Entity related to CFIUS approval, to terms and conditions which would, individually or in aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent or a material adverse effect on any of the following with regard to Parents business in the United States as conducted on the date hereof: its operations, condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets (tangible or intangible), liabilities or results of operations, (y) materially impair Parents control over the Company or Parents business in the United States as conducted on the date hereof, or (z) materially impair Parents ability to compete in the United States through the products and services offered or planned to be offered by the Company or Parent in the United States. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to accept, as a condition to obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of any Governmental Entity, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust (or the imposition of any other conditions or restriction with respect to) any assets or operations of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such action would reasonably be expected to result, after giving effect to the receipt of any reasonably expected proceeds of any divestiture or sale of assets, in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent. 

 

 _Section 5.6_ _Proxy Statement; Form F-4; Stockholders  Meeting_.

   

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and filing with the SEC, in connection with the Merger, a proxy statement (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement"), the F-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and, if necessary, any other statement or schedule relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish the information required to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the F-4 and any such statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, the F-4 and any such statement or schedule, including all amendments and 

   ##### 

  

  

supplements thereto, prior to such documents being filed with the SEC
or disseminated to stockholders of the Company, and shall also give the other
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all
responses to requests for additional information and comments from the SEC
prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the F-4 to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing, and the Company shall as promptly as practicable thereafter mail
the Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The information supplied by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates for inclusion in the F-4 shall not, at the time the F-4 is declared effective, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. The information supplied by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, at the date the Proxy Statement (or any supplement thereto) is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Companys Special Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, or its or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment to the F-4 or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent shall promptly inform the other thereof in writing, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and filing such amendment or supplement with the SEC, use their reasonable best efforts to cause such amendment or supplement to become effective as promptly as possible and, if necessary, mail such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. All documents that the Company or Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the rules and regulations of the NYSE, and applicable Law, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable following the date upon which the F-4 becomes effective (and in no event later than 45 days after such date), a special meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement, including approval of the Amendment (such meeting, including reconvened meeting held following any postponement or adjournment thereof, the "Special Meeting"), and shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.3(c) or (d), (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation") and approval of the Amendment and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption and approval. Notwithstanding any Adverse 

   ##### 

  

  

Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, or any other
fact or circumstance, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders
of the Company at the Special Meeting for the purpose of adopting this
Agreement, with such disclosures as shall be required by applicable Law; 
_provided_ that any such statement or disclosure made that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
statement or disclosure (except that a mere "stop, look and listen"
disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the 1934 Act shall not
constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change), and no Acquisition Proposal
shall be presented to the stockholders of the Company at the Special Meeting
or any other meeting of the Companys stockholders. At any Special Meeting
following any such Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company may submit this
Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation or with a negative
recommendation (although the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board
may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative
recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto. 

  

 _Section 5.7_ _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall each give prompt notice to the other parties hereto of (a) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (b) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. In addition, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any fact, event or circumstance known to the Company that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to the Company, to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any fact, event or circumstance known to Parent that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to Parent, to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

 _Section 5.8_ _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

   

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, subject to applicable Law, comply with the obligations of the Company under the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and officers, in each case as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and disclosed in Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in such capacities ("Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law 

   ##### 

  

  

against any losses, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
or liabilities arising out of or resulting from any threatened or actual
claim, action, investigation, suit or proceeding (a "Claim") that is based in
whole or in part on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and that arises out of or relates to actions or omissions or
alleged actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including any such Claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time, and shall, jointly and severally, pay any
expenses to each Indemnified Party, as incurred, in advance of the final
disposition of any such Claim to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to receive such
advances from Parent or the Surviving Corporation within ten Business Day of
receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of
a request therefor, provided that, if required by applicable Law,
any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification. 

   

 (c) In the event any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any capacity in any Claim based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, any matter, including the transactions contemplated hereby, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties and upon such assumption the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than the reasonable legal expenses (taking into account the reduced role) incurred by one additional counsel of such Indemnified Party to monitor such defense, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for any Indemnified Party reasonably advises the Surviving Corporation that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and such Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to him or her after consultation with the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall as promptly as practicable pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Party, (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.8(c) to pay for only one firm of primary counsel and one firm of local counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (iv) the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.8, upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.8 except to the extent such failure to notify materially 

   ##### 

  

  

prejudices the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporations obligations
under this Section 5.8 shall continue in full force and effect for a period
of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. 

   

 (d) No Indemnified Party shall settle any Claim without the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), nor shall the Surviving Corporation settle any Claim unless (i) all Indemnified Parties against whom such Claim was made have consented to such settlement in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), or (ii) such settlement includes an unconditional general release from the party making the Claim for all Indemnified Parties against whom such Claim was made and does not include any findings of fact or admissions of fault or culpability as to any Indemnified Party against whom such Claim was made. The provisions of this Section 5.8 are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the respective Indemnified Parties. 

  

 (e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, directors and officers liability insurance covering, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred before the Effective Time, on terms and conditions no less favorable to such directors and officers than those in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such period shall not exceed 250% of the per annum rate of premium currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance on the date of this Agreement. In the event that the annual premium for such insurance exceeds such maximum amount, the Company shall purchase as much coverage per policy year as is reasonably available for such maximum amount. 

  

 _Section 5.9_ _Publicity_. On the date this Agreement is executed (or if executed after the close of business in the U.S., prior to the opening of the NYSE on the next day), Parent and the Company shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as may be required by applicable Law, order or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body, national securities exchange or association, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (b) No party shall issue any press release or other public statement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without first providing the other parties with a written copy of the text of such release or statement and obtaining the consent of the other parties to such release or statement, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The consent provided for in this Section 5.9 shall not be required if the delay would preclude the timely issuance of a press release or 

   ##### 

  

  

public statement required by Law or applicable regulations. The provisions of
this Section 5.9 shall not be construed as limiting the parties from
communications consistent with the purposes of this Agreement, including but
not limited to seeking the regulatory and stockholder approvals contemplated
hereby. 

  

 _Section 5.10_ _Financing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and effectuate the Financing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all material developments concerning the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Commitment Letter in any manner that would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter.

   

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and employees to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its advisors and accountants to, provide reasonable and customary cooperation with Parent and its affiliates in connection with the Parent Equity Offering and the arrangement of the Financing and any other financing that Parent, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary to fund the transaction, including providing access to documents, personnel and facilities, participating in meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows, rating agency presentations, the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses, rating agency presentations, other marketing material and similar documents, obtaining comfort letters from the Companys accountants (which comfort letters shall be customary in form, scope and substance), and obtaining legal opinions from the Companys outside counsel (which legal opinions shall be customary in form, scope and substance), as may be reasonably requested by Parent.

Parent shall apply for a listing on either the Oslo Stock Exchange (the "OSE"), or at the option of Parent, the London Stock Exchange (the "LSE"), for all Parent Common Shares, including the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Parent Equity Offering, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such listing prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all material developments concerning the listing on the OSE and the Parent Equity Offering, including, but not limited to, providing access to drafts and final versions of the pre-listing report, the listing application and the prospectus.

  

 _Section 5.12_ _Employee Benefits_.

   

 (a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to individuals who are employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who remain employed with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("Affected Employees"), for a period of one year, employee benefits (i) pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans substantially as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or (ii) pursuant to employee benefit plans, 

   ##### 

  

  

programs, policies or arrangements maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries provided to similarly situated employees of Parent (it being
understood that inclusion of Affected Employees in the employee benefit plans
of Parent or its Subsidiaries may occur at different times with respect to
different plans) on terms no less favorable in the aggregate than the
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. 

   

 (b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Affected Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and determination of the level of benefits under (but not for accrual of defined benefit pension purposes) any employee benefit and compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries for such Affected Employees service with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (or any predecessor entity) to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to, cause its third-party insurance providers or third-party administrators to, (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Affected Employees or their covered dependents under any medical, dental, vision or other welfare benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any comparable Company Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit plan maintained for the Affected Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) provide each Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance or out-of-pocket requirements under any medical, dental, vision or other welfare benefit plans that such employees and their covered dependents are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, fulfill and discharge and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and discharge in accordance with their terms the Company Benefit Plans (as in effect as of the Effective Time); provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent Parent from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plans in accordance with the terms of such plans. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.12 or any other provision of this Agreement shall (i) be construed to create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Affected Employee or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any dependent thereof) or any person other than the parties to this Agreement or any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period or to a particular term or condition of employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any specific employee benefit plans, (iii) be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit or

This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). 

  

 (b) Parent and the Company shall jointly cooperate in connection with the Companys request for the IRS Ruling and shall promptly provide all information in connection with the IRS Ruling request.

Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the certificates described in this Section 5.13(c). 

  

 (d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value-added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time.

VOTING AGREEMENT 

   

VOTING AGREEMENT 

   

 THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of August 12, 2010, between Lime Rock Partners V, L.P., a Cayman Island exempted limited partnership (the " _Stockholder_ "), on the one hand, and Seawell Limited, a Bermuda corporation (" _Sea_ "), on the other hand. 

   

W I T N E S S E T H: 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sea, Wellco Sub Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sea (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Allis Chalmers Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as the same may be amended or supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), providing that, among other things, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ "), each outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") will be converted, at the election of the holder thereof, into either 1.15 common shares, par value $2.00 per share, of Sea (" _Sea Common Shares_ "), subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement, or $4.25 in cash, subject to pro ration as provided in the Merger Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, the Stockholder owns of record and possesses legal title to 19,889,044 shares of Company Common Stock and 36,393 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company_ _Preferred Stock_ "), which on an as-converted basis represents, together with such shares of Company Common Stock, approximately 39.4% of the outstanding Company Common Stock (collectively, such shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock are referred to herein as the " _Subject Shares_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to Sea to enter into the Merger Agreement, Sea has required that the Stockholder enter into this Agreement; 

   

 WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder, and the form and substance of this Agreement, have been approved by the independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company; and 

   

 WHEREAS, Sea is prepared to execute the Merger Agreement and tender it to the Company for execution by the Company upon receipt of this Agreement duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, to induce Sea to enter into, and in consideration of its entering into, the Merger Agreement, and in consideration of the promises and the 

      ##### 

  

    

representations, warranties and agreements contained herein and therein, the
parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: 

   

 1. _Representations and Warranties of the Stockholder_. The Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Sea as of the date hereof as follows: 

   

 (a) _Due Organization; Qualification_. The Stockholder is an exempted limited partnership duly formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws thereof. 

   

 (b) _Authority; No Violation_. The Stockholder has full limited partnership power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of LRP GP V, Inc., the general partner of Lime Rock Partners GP V, L.P., the general partner of the Stockholder, and no other limited partnership proceedings on the part of the Stockholder are necessary to approve this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Sea) this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity and the discretion of the court before which any proceedings seeking injunctive relief or specific performance may be brought. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Stockholder, nor the consummation by the Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Stockholder with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (x) violate any provision of the governing documents of the Stockholder or the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar governing documents of any of the Stockholders affiliates (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (y) violate any statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to the Stockholder or any of the Stockholders affiliates, or any of their respective properties or assets, or (z) violate, conflict with, result in a breach of any provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Subject Shares pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the 

   ##### 

  

    

Stockholder or any of the Stockholders affiliates is a party, or by which
they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected. 

   

 (c) _The Subject Shares_. The Stockholder is the beneficial owner of and has the sole right to vote and dispose of the Subject Shares, free and clear of any Encumbrances whatsoever, except for any Liens which arise hereunder.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, there are no agreements or arrangements of any kind, contingent or otherwise, obligating the Stockholder to sell, transfer (including by tendering into any tender or exchange offer), assign, grant a participation interest in, option, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber, including by operation of law or otherwise (each, a " _Transfer_ "), or cause to be Transferred, any of the Subject Shares, and (ii) no Person (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has any contractual or other right or obligation to purchase or otherwise acquire any of the Subject Shares. Neither the Stockholder nor any of its affiliates is a party to, or otherwise subject to, any Derivative Transaction (as defined herein). Other than the Subject Shares, the Stockholder does not own any equity interests or other securities in the Company. " _Derivative Transaction_ " means the purchase or acquisition or sale or transfer of any derivative security that gives any Person or any of such Persons affiliates the economic equivalent of ownership of an amount of any equity securities of the Company (including the Subject Shares) or any of its Subsidiaries due to the fact that the value of the derivative is explicitly determined by reference to the price or value of such securities, or which provides such Person or any of such Persons affiliates an opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit, or to share in any profit, derived from any change in the value of such securities, in any case without regard to whether (x) such derivative conveys any voting rights in such securities to such Person or any of such Persons affiliates, (y) the derivative is required to be, or capable of being, settled through delivery of such securities, or (z) such Person or any of such Persons affiliates may have entered into other transactions that hedge the economic effect of such derivative. 

   

 (d) _Certain Transactions Involving Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock_. Since January 1, 2010, other than Restricted Stock Units that vest January 29, 2001 granted to John T. Reynolds and Saad A. Bargach, such proceeds to be remitted to Lime Rock Management LP, the Stockholder has not purchased, received, accepted as collateral, sold, transferred, hypothecated, pledged, or exchanged any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, or any options, warrants, or rights to purchase or sell shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, and has not entered into, and is not subject to (regardless of when entered into), any agreement to do any of the foregoing. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation pending, or to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the Stockholder, or any property or asset of the Stockholder, before any Governmental Entity that seeks to delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (f) _No Consents Required_. No consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Person or Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Stockholder in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _Reliance_. The Stockholder understands and acknowledges that Sea is entering into, and causing Merger Sub to enter into, the Merger Agreement in reliance upon the Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

   

 (h) _Finder s Fees._ No investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary is entitled to a fee or commission from Sea, Merger Sub or the Company in respect of this Agreement based upon any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of the Stockholder. 

   

 (i) _Investment Intent, Etc._  

   

 (i) The Stockholder is financially able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Sea Common Shares, has adequate means for providing for its current needs and personal contingencies, and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Sea Common Shares, as the case may be, and can afford a complete loss of its investment. 

   

 (ii) The Stockholder has been provided an opportunity for a reasonable time prior to the date hereof to obtain information concerning the Sea Common Shares, Sea and all other information to the extent Sea possesses such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense. The Stockholder has been given the opportunity for a reasonable time prior to the date hereof to ask questions of, and receive answers from, Sea or its representatives concerning the Sea Common Shares and other matters pertaining to this investment. The Stockholder has not been furnished with any representation, oral or otherwise, in connection with any offering of the Sea Common Shares other than Seas express representations and warranties set forth herein, and the Stockholder is not relying on Sea or its Affiliates with respect to economic considerations involved in this investment.

   ##### 

  

   

 (d) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

   

 (e) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 (g) _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction herein, or the application thereof to any circumstance, shall, to any extent, be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions herein and the application thereof to any other circumstances, shall remain in full force and effect, shall not in any way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the parties hereto shall reasonably negotiate in good faith a substitute term or provision that comes as close as possible to the invalidated and unenforceable term or provision, and that puts each party in a position as nearly comparable as possible to the position each such party would have been in but for the finding of invalidity or unenforceability, while remaining valid and enforceable. 

   

 (h) _Waiver_. Any provisions of this Agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 

   

 (i) _Further Assurances_. The Stockholder will, from time to time, (i) at the request of Sea take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents,

 (k) _Capitalized Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 7. _Stockholder Capacity_. The Stockholder signs solely in its capacity as the beneficial owner of the Subject Shares and nothing contained herein shall limit or affect any actions taken by any officer, director, partner, affiliate or representative of the Stockholder who is or becomes an officer or a director of the Company in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company to the extent such actions are permissible under the Merger Agreement, and none of such actions in such capacity shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this Agreement.
