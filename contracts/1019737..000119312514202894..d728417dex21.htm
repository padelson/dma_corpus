outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the payment of any portion of the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect thereto, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit of
loss with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Escrow Agent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Person for any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Requirements
of Laws. If any Company Stock Certificate has not been surrendered before
five (5) years after the Effective Time (or immediately before such earlier
date on which the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of any such
Company Stock Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body), any such Per Share Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by Requirements of Laws, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



17 2.7. _Estimated Cash Closing Consideration; Consideration Spreadsheet;
Adjustment._  

(a) Attached as _Schedule 2.7(a)_ is a spreadsheet (the " _Consideration
Spreadsheet_ ") which sets forth all of the following information, as of the
Closing Date: (i) the names of all the holders of Company Common Stock and
Company Options and their respective addresses; (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such Persons and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Options held by such Persons; (iii) the
exercise price per share of each Company Option; (iv) the Fully Diluted
Company Share Number, (v) a good faith estimate by the Company of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital (such estimate, the " _Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital_ ") as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and based
thereon, a calculation of the estimated Cash Closing Consideration (the "
_Estimated Cash Closing Consideration_ "), including each of the components
thereof, and the Estimated Cash Closing Consideration Per Share; (vi) the
amount of Estimated Cash Closing Consideration payable to each holder of
Company Common Stock and to each holder of a Company Option (before deduction
for any Tax withholding); and (vii) the Securityholder Percentage of each
Securityholder.

 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to the Securityholder Representative an unaudited statement (the "
_Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_ ") which sets forth ParentÂ’s good
faith calculations of (i) the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), and (ii) the Cash Closing Consideration
based on the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, which shall include only
the categories of assets and liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiary,
shown on _Schedule 2.7(b)_.

 

(c) Promptly following receipt of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, the Securityholder Representative may review the same and, within
thirty (30) days after the date of such receipt, shall deliver to Parent a
certificate signed by the Securityholder Representative either accepting such
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or setting forth each of
the Securityholder RepresentativeÂ’s objections to the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement (the " _Statement of Objections_ ") and the amount
of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Unresolved Objections_
"), together with a complete and reasonably detailed list of the reasons
therefor and calculations which, in the Securityholder RepresentativeÂ’s view,
are necessary to eliminate the Unresolved Objections. If the Securityholder
Representative does not deliver the Statement of Objections within such 30-day
period, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, including the amount
of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital shown thereon, shall be
final and binding on all parties hereto for purposes of this Agreement but,
subject to _Section 8.6(d)_, shall not limit the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

(d) If the Securityholder Representative delivers the Statement of Objections
within such 30-day period, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall
use their reasonable efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed
Adjustments_ ") the Unresolved Objections and, if the Securityholder
Representative and Parent so resolve all the Unresolved Objections, the
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement, including the amount of the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital shown thereon, as adjusted by the Agreed
Adjustments, shall be final and binding on all parties hereto for purposes of
this Agreement but, subject to _Section 8.6(d)_, shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement.

 



18 (e) If any Unresolved Objections are not resolved by the Agreed Adjustments
within the twenty (20) day period next following such 30-day period, then
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall submit the remaining
Unresolved Objections that have not been resolved by the Agreed Adjustments to
Deloitte and Touche LLP (or to such other national accounting firm acceptable
to the Securityholder Representative and Parent) and such firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "), acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, shall be
directed by Parent and the Securityholder Representative to resolve such
remaining Unresolved Objections (based solely on the presentations by Parent
and by the Securityholder Representative as to whether such remaining
Unresolved Objections have been determined in a manner consistent with this
Agreement) as promptly as reasonably practicable and by delivering written
notice to each of Parent and the Securityholder Representative setting forth
its resolution of such remaining Unresolved Objections. The Accounting Firm
shall only decide the specific remaining Unresolved Objections and its
decision must be within the range of values assigned to such item in the
Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement and the Statement of Objections,
respectively. The Accounting Firm shall be requested to make a determination
as soon as practicable and within thirty (30) days (or such other time as the
parties hereto shall agree in writing) after its engagement. The Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement, including the amount of the Final Closing Date
Net Working Capital shown thereon, after giving effect to any Agreed
Adjustments and to such resolution by the Accounting Firm, shall be final and
binding on all parties hereto for purposes of this Agreement but, subject to 
_Section 8.6(d)_, shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

(f) The parties hereto shall make available to Parent, the Securityholder
Representative and, if applicable, the Accounting Firm, such books, records
and other information as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to
prepare or review the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement or any
Unresolved Objections submitted to the Accounting Firm, including work papers
prepared by Parent, the Securityholder Representative and their respective
accountants to the extent that they relate to the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement, _provided_ that such access shall be in a manner that does
not interfere with the normal business operations of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Business. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
hereunder shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative, on the other hand, in proportions inverse to the relative
extent to which they prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportions and allocation shall be determined by the Accounting Firm.

 

(g) If the amount of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, is less than the amount of the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, then the Securityholder
Representative shall pay to Parent (first from the Advance Amount and, if such
payment is greater than the Advance Amount, from Securityholders), within
seven (7) days after such determination, an amount of cash equal to the
excess of the amount of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital over
such amount of the Closing Date Net Working Capital. If the amount of the
Final Closing Date Net Working

 



19  Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.7_, exceeds the
amount of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital (such amount, the "
_Positive Adjustment Amount_ "), then Parent shall, within seven (7) days
after such determination, (A) deposit with the Escrow Agent to then pay to
each Securityholder holding Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, an amount equal to such SecurityholderÂ’s Securityholder
Percentage of the Positive Adjustment Amount and (B) pay to the Surviving
Corporation, for further distribution, net of applicable withholding Tax, to
each Securityholder holding Company Options immediately prior to the
Effective Time, an amount equal to such SecurityholderÂ’s Securityholder
Percentage of the Positive Adjustment Amount. Any payments pursuant to this
_Section 2.7(g)_ shall be an adjustment to the Cash Closing Consideration.

2.8. _Contingent Payment_.

 

(a) _Calculation of Contingent Payment_.

 

(i) The aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and Option Consideration
shall include an additional payment in cash, if any, to be made by Parent to
the Securityholders in the manner described herein (any such payment being a "
_Contingent Payment_ ") based on the performance of the Surviving Corporation
and the Subsidiary during the period beginning on and including November 1,
2014 and ending on and including October 31, 2015 (the " _Additional Period_
") to be determined as set forth in this _Section 2.8_.

 

(ii) The Contingent Payment shall be equal to the excess, if any, of (A) the
sum of (x) an amount equal to the product of 0.36 and the revenue of the
Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiary recognized by the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to the Agreed Accounting Principles for the Additional
Period and (y) an amount equal to the product of 5.7 and the EBITDA (as
defined below) of the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiary for the
Additional Period, over (B) the amount of the Cash Closing Consideration
(prior to any adjustment thereto pursuant to _Section 2.7_).

 

(iii) As used herein, " _EBITDA_ " means the earnings of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiary, on a consolidated basis for the Additional
Period before expenses for interest, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization, as determined consistently with (x) the Income Statement Format
on _Exhibit E_ and (y) the provisions of this  _Section 2.8_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any of the following items are included in calculating
EBITDA for purposes of this _Section 2.8_, such items shall be added back for
purposes of such calculation: (A) any unpaid Selling Expenses, (B) the fee to
be paid to RDN pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)(i)_, (C) any payments to Option
Holders pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, (D) any Losses or Expenses for which a
Parent Group Member was indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.1_, (E) any
expenses not incurred during or related to the Additional Period, (F) any
extraordinary gains or losses in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles and (G) prior to October 31, 2015, any Excess
Capital Expenditures but only to the extent consented or agreed to by Parent
and the Company CEO pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)(iv)(C)_.

 



20 (iv) Payments charged by the Surviving Corporation to Parent or its Affiliates
or charged by Parent or its Affiliates to the Surviving Corporation, in each
case pursuant to the Services Agreement shall be included in the determination
of the Contingent Payment, as provided in the Services Agreement. During the
Additional Period (A) the Surviving Corporation shall be charged by Parent a
referral fee of two percent (2%) of all client revenue of the Surviving
Corporation, as and when received, solely attributable to sales leads from the
staff of Parent or any of its Affiliates outside of the Surviving
Corporation, including the sales leads provided to the Surviving Corporation
prior to Closing listed on _Schedule 2.8(a)(iv)_ , and (B) the Surviving
Corporation shall be credited with a referral fee of two percent (2%) of all
client revenue of Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiary), as and when received, solely attributable to
sales leads from the staff of the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary to
Parent or such Affiliates (including such sales leads provided by staff of the
Surviving Corporation to the Alleviant practice group of ParentÂ’s Healthcare
Practice (" _Alleviant_ ") for physician-based revenue cycle
outsourcing engagements) and (C) if the Company CEO determines that during
the Additional Period the Surviving Corporation needs to incur capital
expenditures in excess of an amount equal to 3.2 percent (3.2%) of the total
gross client fees actually billed or billable by the Surviving Corporation
during the Additional Period (the " _Excess Capital Expenditures_ "), then the
Company CEO shall notify Parent of such determination and the Company CEO and
Parent shall review and discuss such Excess Capital Expenditures. The Company
CEO and Parent shall agree upon appropriate adjustments to the calculation of
the Contingent Payment to reflect such Excess Capital Expenditures that relate
to long term growth objectives. To the extent any costs incurred by the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary that are attributable to the
Additional Period are directly related to supporting practices or businesses
of Parent other than the Business, such as specified software
development projects, such costs shall not be included in determining EBITDA
for the Additional Period; provided Parent and the Company CEO specify any
such material costs and agree in advance to the exclusion of such costs from
the determination of EBITDA or such costs are otherwise accounted for in the
Services Agreement.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes
of determining the Contingent Payment, (A) the Surviving Corporation shall
track the vacation days actually used during the Additional Period for those
employees of the Surviving Corporation who as of the Closing Date
are designated as participants in the CompanyÂ’s discretionary time off plan
(" _DTO Plan_ ") in order to determine the aggregate vacation expense during
the Additional Period if such employees did not participate in the DTO Plan
and (B) the Surviving Corporation shall recognize vacation expense for such
employees assuming that the DTO Plan had not been implemented and such
employees did not participate in the DTO Plan.

 

(b) _Determination of Contingent Payment_.

 

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the end of the Additional Period, Parent
shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholder Representative an unaudited
statement which sets forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the aggregate
Contingent Payment, if any, to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.8_ (the "
_Contingent Payment Statement_ "). Promptly 

 



21  following receipt of the Contingent Payment Statement, the Securityholder
Representative may review the same and, within thirty (30) days after such
receipt, shall deliver to Parent a certificate signed by the Securityholder
Representative either accepting the Contingent Payment Statement or setting
forth each of the Securityholder RepresentativeÂ’s objections to the Contingent
Payment Statement and the amount of the Contingent Payment, if any, (the "
_Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections_ "), together with a complete and
reasonably detailed list of the reasons therefor and calculations which, in
the Securityholder RepresentativeÂ’s view, are necessary to eliminate the
Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections. If the Securityholder Representative
does not so object within such 30-day period, the Contingent Payment
Statement, including the amount of the Contingent Payment, if any, shown
thereon shall be final and binding on all parties hereto for purposes of this
Agreement but shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

(ii) If the Securityholder Representative so objects within such 30-day
period, Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall use their
reasonable efforts to resolve by written agreement (the " _Agreed Contingent
Payment Adjustments_ ") the Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections and, if
the Securityholder Representative and Parent so resolve all the Unresolved
Contingent Payment Objections, the Contingent Payment Schedule, including the
amount of the Contingent Payment, if any, shown thereon, as adjusted by the
Agreed Contingent Payment Adjustments, shall be final and binding on all
parties hereto for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement.

 

(iii) If any Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections are not resolved by the
Agreed Contingent Payment Adjustments within the twenty (20) day period next
following such 30-day period, then Parent and the Securityholder
Representative shall submit the remaining Unresolved Contingent Payment
Objections that have not been resolved by the Agreed Contingent
Payment Adjustments to the Accounting Firm and the Accounting Firm shall be
directed by Parent and the Securityholder Representative to resolve such
remaining Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections (based solely on the
presentations by Parent and by the Securityholder Representative as to
whether such remaining Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections have been
determined in a manner consistent with this Agreement) as promptly as
reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice to each of Parent and
the Securityholder Representative setting forth its resolution of such
remaining Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections. The Contingent Payment
schedule, including the amount of the Contingent Payment, if any, shown
thereon, after giving effect to any Agreed Contingent Payment Adjustments and
to such resolution by the Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding on all
parties hereto for purposes of this Agreement but shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

(iv) The parties hereto shall make available to Parent, the Securityholder
Representative and, if applicable, the Accounting Firm, such books, records
and other information as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to
prepare or review the

 



22  Contingent Payment Schedule or any Unresolved Contingent Payment Objections
submitted to the Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm
hereunder shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative, on the other hand, in proportions inverse to the relative
extent to which they prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportions and allocation shall be determined by the Accounting Firm.

(c) _Payment of Contingent Payment and RDN Fee_.

 

(i) On or prior to the later of (A) ninety (90) days after the end of the
Additional Period and (B) five (5) days following the final and binding
determination of the amount of such Contingent Payment pursuant to this
_Section 2.8_, Parent shall (x) pay to RDN the fee, if any, which is due from
the Company to RDN as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (provided that at least four (4) business days prior to the date for
payment of the Contingent Payment, Parent shall confirm with the
Securityholder Representative in writing the amount of such fee), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account in the United States
specified by RDN in writing to Parent at least two (2) business days prior to
the date for payment of such fee, and (y) subject to subsection (ii) of this
_Section 2.8(c)_, (I) pay or cause the Escrow Agent to pay to each
Securityholder holding Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time, an amount equal to the such SecurityholderÂ’s Securityholder
Percentage of the amount, if any, of the Contingent Payment (less the amount
of such fee payable to RDN), which is due pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 2.8_ and (II) pay, and cause the Surviving Corporation to pay,
through the Surviving CorporationÂ’s payroll system in the case of Option
Holders who are or were employees of the Company, to each Securityholder
holding Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount
equal to such SecurityholderÂ’s Securityholder Percentage of the amount, if
any, of the Contingent Payment (less the amount of such fee payable to RDN)
which is due pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.8_, net of
applicable withholding Tax, with any such payments to Option Holders who are
not current or former employees of the Company to be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account in the United States specified by
such Securityholder in writing to Parent at least two (2) business days prior
to the date for payment of the Contingent Payment.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have the right to offset or
set-off against and withhold a portion of the Contingent Payment, if any,
which may be due pursuant to this Agreement in an amount equal to any unpaid
claims made by any Parent Group Member pursuant to  _Article VIII_;
_provided_ that (A) the entire Escrow Account has been disbursed or is subject
to claims pursuant to _Article VIII_, and (B) if the Securityholder
Representative has disputed such unpaid claims, Parent shall, in lieu of such
set-off, deposit the amount of such unpaid claims into the Escrow Account to
be held, invested, reinvested and disbursed in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

 



23 (d) _Conduct of the Business during the Additional Period_.

 

(i) Parent acknowledges that the SecurityholdersÂ’ opportunity to receive the
Contingent Payment pursuant to this Agreement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent acknowledges that it owes
the Securityholders a duty of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the
conduct of the Business and the Surviving Corporation during the Additional
Period, and each of the Key Securityholders and the Company CEO acknowledges
that the Key Securityholders and the Company CEO owe Parent a duty of good
faith and fair dealing with regard to the conduct of the Business and the
Surviving Corporation during the Additional Period. During the Additional
Period (A) except as otherwise provided herein, each of the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiary will be operated only in the ordinary course
(provided that the parties recognize and agree that the Business may be
modified and actions may be taken or not taken from time to time to reflect
changing business and market conditions and other circumstances; provided that
if either Parent or the Company CEO believes that any material modifications
or actions are necessary to respond to such changes, Parent and the Company
CEO shall agree on such changes prior to making such material modifications or
taking such material actions) and in compliance with all applicable legal,
regulatory and compliance requirements for each of the Surviving Corporation
and the Subsidiary, as well as all legal, regulatory and compliance
requirements, policies and procedures of Parent which are generally applicable
to businesses owned by Parent and its Affiliates, and (B) the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiary will each be operated in such a manner so as to
allow for the accurate calculation of the Contingent Payment, including the
determination of revenue and EBITDA of the Surviving Corporation and the

(ii) During the Additional Period, the Surviving Corporation will be managed
by Michael Halberda as the chief executive officer of the Surviving
Corporation, as long as he remains employed by the Surviving Corporation, or
his successor, if any (the " _Company CEO_ "). If Michael Halberda (or any
successor to him as Company CEO) is no longer employed by the Surviving
Corporation or is otherwise unwilling or unable to serve as Company CEO during
the Additional Period, then the successor to the Company CEO will be (A)
Jayson Yardley, as long as he remains employed by the Surviving Corporation,
or (B) if Jayson Yardley is no longer employed by the Surviving Corporation or
is otherwise unwilling or unable to serve as Company CEO during the
Additional Period, an individual designated by Parent, subject to the approval
(which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Securityholders by

Securityholders). During the Additional Period, the Company CEO may not be
terminated by the Surviving Corporation or Parent without Cause (as defined in
the employment agreement with the Company CEO).

material actions outside the ordinary course, Parent and the Company CEO shall
agree on such actions prior to taking such actions.

 

(iv) During the Additional Period, the Surviving Corporation shall be allowed

and procedures of Parent and its Affiliates in effect from time to time.

 

(v) During the Additional Period (A) all hospital-based revenue cycle
outsourcing client engagements for Parent or its Affiliates (including the

the Company CEO shall determine whether to pursue and accept any particular
such engagement, (B) if any hospital-based revenue cycle outsourcing
engagement performed by the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary includes
physician-based revenue cycle outsourcing services, Alleviant shall act as
the subcontractor for the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, as
applicable, to provide such services and the revenue recognized by the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary in respect of such engagement shall be
reduced by the amount of such subcontracting expenses, (C) the Surviving
Corporation, the Subsidiary and the rest of ParentÂ’s Healthcare Practice will
reasonably cooperate in order to support the marketing of the hospital-based
revenue cycle outsourcing client engagements of the Surviving Corporation or

on the use of such resources from time to time, (G) if Parent or its
Affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiary) sells or
licenses the business intelligence or analytics tools of the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiary to non-Surviving Corporation or non-Subsidiary
clients, as applicable, Parent or such Affiliate will receive a sales
commission at an agreed on rate for reseller commissions, and the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiary shall recognize the revenue for such sales and
the expense for such sales commission and (H) the Surviving Corporation, and
to the extent applicable, the Subsidiary, shall customize and provide support
to Alleviant, for use in AlleviantÂ’s practice, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
Metrix work flow and organizational development tools pursuant to an agreed
upon Schedule and work plan; _provided_ that for purposes of determining the

be charged any costs or expenses related to providing such customization and
support.

nor the Subsidiary will be merged or combined with another practice or
business of Parent or Affiliates, (B) there will be no material change in the
service offerings of the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary from the
offerings on the date hereof, _provided_ that (I) Parent may require the
Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary to discontinue or terminate any such
offering so long as Parent and the Company CEO agree upon the manner in which
such offering is discontinued or terminated so as to (x) not adversely affect
the Surviving CorporationÂ’s or the SubsidiaryÂ’s business relationship with the
clients to which such offering was provided and (y) minimize any adverse
effect on the Surviving CorporationÂ’s or the SubsidiaryÂ’s ability to generate
revenue and EBITDA during the Additional Period, and (II) the Surviving
Corporation and the Subsidiary shall make adjustments to the Business pursuant
to, and shall calculate the Contingent Payment in accordance with, the plan

above, Parent and the Company CEO may decide to make acquisitions relating to,
or other investments in, the Business (such as development of new tools, or
recruiting and hiring of new personnel) which would reasonably be expected to
either materially increase or materially decrease the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
or the SubsidiaryÂ’s ability to generate revenue and EBITDA during the
Additional Period, and in such cases Parent and the Company CEO shall agree in
advance upon appropriate adjustments to the calculation of the Contingent
Payment to reflect the expected increase or decrease, as the case may be, (D)
notwithstanding clauses (A) and (B) above, Parent and the Company CEO may
decide to undertake significant new comprehensive revenue cycle management
assignments which could materially decrease the Surviving CorporationÂ’s or

in such cases Parent and the Company CEO shall agree in advance upon
appropriate adjustments to the calculation of the Contingent Payment
to reflect the expected decrease and (E) the Surviving Corporation will not
sell or otherwise transfer any material assets used in the conduct of the
Business, other than sales or transfers in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

(vii) During the Additional Period, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation) shall, without the prior written
consent of the Securityholder Representative, conduct any transaction between
the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent or
any Affiliate of Parent (other than the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiary), on the other hand, other than pursuant to the Services Agreement
or as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement.

based on, or otherwise linked to, employment with the Surviving Corporation
or the Subsidiary. Each Key Securityholder hereby

 



26  (i) confirms that the payment of the Estimated Cash Closing Consideration
complies with the foregoing requirements and (ii) agrees that at the time of
any payment of any Contingent Payment and, otherwise upon request by Parent
from time to time after Closing, the Securityholder Representative (on behalf
of the Securityholders) shall confirm its compliance with the foregoing
requirements and provide Parent with any documentation reasonably requested
by Parent.

52 ARTICLE VII

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

7.1. _Covenant Not to Compete or Solicit Business_.

 

(a) In furtherance of the Merger by virtue of the transactions contemplated
hereby and to more effectively protect the value and goodwill of the
Surviving Corporation and the Business, each of the Individual Key
Securityholders covenants and agrees that, for a period ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither such Individual Key Securityholder
nor any of his Affiliates will:

(i) directly or indirectly (whether as principal, agent, employee consultant,
independent contractor, partner or otherwise) own, manage, operate, control,
participate in, perform services for, or otherwise carry on, a business
competitive with the Business, the Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation in
the Restricted Geographic Area, including for or with any client or customer
of the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary (it being understood by the
parties hereto that the Business is not limited to any particular region of
the Restricted Geographic Area and that the Business may be engaged
in effectively from any location in the Restricted Geographic Area); or

(ii) induce or attempt to persuade any employee, consultant, agent, supplier,
client or customer of the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary to terminate
such employment, agency or business relationship in order to enter into any
such relationship on behalf of any other business organization in competition
with the Business or hire or retain any employee or any former employee who
was an employee of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary
within the immediately preceding twelve month period;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this _Section 7.1_ shall
prohibit any Individual Key Securityholder or his Affiliates from owning not
in excess of 5% in the aggregate of any class of capital stock of any
corporation if such stock is publicly traded. Each Key Securityholder also
covenants and agrees that such Key Securityholder will not, and will not
permit any of such Key SecurityholderÂ’s Affiliates to, divulge or make use of
any Trade Secrets or other confidential information of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Subsidiary or the Business other than to disclose
such secrets and information to Parent or its Affiliates or other than in the
ordinary course of the Business after the Closing.

(b) If any Individual Key Securityholder or any Affiliate of an Individual
Key Securityholder violates any of the obligations under this _Section 7.1_,
Parent may proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages or other
relief as a court may deem appropriate. Each Individual Key Securityholder
acknowledges that a violation of this _Section 7.1_ may cause Parent
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money damages.
Each Individual Key Securityholder therefore agrees that in the event of any
actual or threatened violation of this _Section 7.1_, Parent shall be
entitled, in addition to other remedies that it may have, to a temporary
restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against
such Individual Key Securityholder or such Affiliate of such Individual Key
Securityholder to prevent

 



53  any violations of this _Section 7.1_, without the necessity of posting a
bond. The prevailing party in any action commenced under this _Section 7.1_
shall also be entitled to receive reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and court costs.
It is the intent and understanding of each party hereto that if, in any action
before any court or agency legally empowered to enforce this _Section 7.1_,
any term, restriction, covenant or promise in this _Section 7.1_ is found to
be unreasonable and for that reason unenforceable, then such term,
restriction, covenant or promise shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable by such court or agency.

7.2. _Taxes_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_. Each Key Securityholder jointly and severally
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to _Article VIII_ each Parent
Group Member from and against any and all Losses and Expense incurred by such
Parent Group Member in connection with or arising from (A) all Taxes imposed
on the Company or the Subsidiary or for which either the Company or the
Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of a
Company Group (including Taxes for which the Company or the Subsidiary may be
liable pursuant to Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.1502-6 or similar provisions of state,
local or foreign law as a result of having been a member of a Company Group
and any Taxes resulting from the Company or the Subsidiary ceasing to be a
member of any Company Group), and (B) all Taxes imposed on the Company or the
Subsidiary, or for which the Company or the Subsidiary may otherwise be
liable, for any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date
and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period
up to and including the Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any
extraordinary transaction occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing at
the direction of Parent shall be treated by the Company, the Securityholders
and Parent for all federal income tax purposes as occurring at the beginning
of the day following the Closing Date. Whenever it is necessary to determine
the liability for Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiary for a Straddle
Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiary for
the portion of the Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date, and
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be
determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable years
or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other
which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and items
of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Company for the Straddle
Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a
"closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company were
closed at the close of the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation and personal property, real property
and other similar Taxes, shall be apportioned between such two taxable years
or periods on a daily basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the
avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Taxes shall not be indemnified by any
Securityholder.

(i) Each Key Securityholder shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
_Article VIII_ shall indemnify and hold harmless each Parent Group Member from
and against any and all Losses and Expenses incurred by such Parent Group
Member in connection with or arising from any gains Tax, sales Tax, use Tax,
stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



54 (ii) Except as provided for in clause (B) below and except to the
extent shown as an asset (or liability reduction) on the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement, if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent
Group Member receives a credit with respect to, or refund of, any Tax for
which any Key Securityholder is liable under this Agreement, Parent shall pay
over to the Securityholder Representative for distribution to the
Securityholders the amount of such refund or credit within fifteen (15) days
after receipt. In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a
payment has been made to the Securityholder Representative by Parent is
subsequently reduced or disallowed, the Securityholder Representative shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent (in accordance with the provisions of 
_Section 7.2(c)_) for any Tax by reason of the reduction or disallowance in
an amount not to exceed the amount actually paid by Parent to the
Securityholder Representative.

 

(A) If Parent, the Company or the Subsidiary becomes entitled to a refund or
credit of Taxes for which any Securityholder is liable under paragraph (a) to
indemnify Parent, the Company or the Subsidiary, and such refund or credit is
attributable to the carryback of losses, credits or similar items from a
taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date and is attributable
to the Company or the Subsidiary, then except as provided in _Section 7.6_,
any Securityholder shall not be entitled to the amount of such refund or
credit, nor shall such Securityholder be obligated under the
preceding sentence to pay Parent the amount of such refund or credit.

(B) For purposes of this _Section 7.2_, Tax refunds shall include any
interest that is paid as part of the payment of such refunds, reduced by the
increase in the original payeeÂ’s federal, state, local, foreign or other Taxes
payable attributable to such interest after taking into account
any offsetting deductions or credits.

(b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Securityholder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the
Company or the Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the Securityholder Representative shall timely remit
(or cause to be remitted first from the Escrow Account) any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns, and Parent shall file or cause to be filed when
due all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Company or the Subsidiary for Straddle Periods and Parent shall timely remit
(or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Parent
will sign (after it has a reasonable opportunity to review and comment) and
file or cause to be timely filed any Tax Returns otherwise required to be
filed by the Securityholder Representative after the Closing Date pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence (including to claim the carryback of any
net operating losses) that are required to be signed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (which Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice (except for claiming Transaction Tax Deductions)
and provided to Parent by the Securityholder Representative pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence) and will provide a copy of such Tax Returns
and evidence of the timely filing of same to the Securityholder
Representative, which shall pay to Parent the amount of the applicable Taxes.

 



55 (ii) The Key Securityholders (first from the Escrow Account), on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall reimburse the other for any Taxes
for which any Key Securityholder or Parent is liable pursuant to paragraph (a)
of this _Section 7.2_ but which are remitted in respect of any Tax Return to
be filed by the other party pursuant to this paragraph (b) upon the written
request of the party entitled to reimbursement setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount owed by the Key Securityholders or Parent, as the
case may be, but in no event earlier than one (1) day prior to the due date
for paying such Taxes.

(c) _Contest Provisions_.

 

(i) Parent shall notify the Securityholder Representative in writing upon
receipt by Parent, any of its Affiliates, the Company or the Subsidiary of
notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits or assessments for which the Key Securityholders may be required to
indemnify Parent Group Members pursuant to paragraph (a) of this  _Section
7.2_, provided that failure to comply with this provision shall not affect
ParentÂ’s right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent a Key
Securityholder has been prejudiced by such failure.

 

(ii) The Securityholder Representative shall have the sole right to represent
the CompanyÂ’s or the SubsidiaryÂ’s interests in and make all decisions in
connection with any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
to Tax liabilities for which the Securityholders may be required to indemnify
Parent Group Members pursuant to paragraph (a) of this _Section 7.2_ and
which relate to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to
employ counsel of the Securityholder RepresentativeÂ’s choice at the
SecurityholdersÂ’ expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Securityholder Representative nor any Securityholder nor any Affiliate of any
Securityholder shall be entitled to settle, either administratively or after
the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the liability for Taxes of any Parent Group
Member, the Company, the Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof for any period
after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent shall have the
sole right to represent the CompanyÂ’s or the SubsidiaryÂ’s interests in and
make all decisions in connection with any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to Straddle Period Tax Returns, and to employ counsel of
ParentÂ’s choice at its expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent
nor any Affiliate of Parent shall be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the liability for Taxes
of any Securityholder Group Member, the Company or any Affiliate thereof for
any period including the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
the Securityholder Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 



56 (d) _Tax Return Amendments_. Without the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, Parent shall not amend or permit the amendment of any Tax Returns
of the Company or the Subsidiary for taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or for any Straddle Period, and shall not extend or
permit the extension of any statute of limitations with respect to such Tax
Returns.

(e) The Key Securityholders and parent shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns in respect of the Company, including maintaining and making available
to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving
all disputes and audits or defending any claim or assessment with respect to
all taxable periods relating to Taxes. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Taxes for which any Key Securityholder may be liable under this
_Section 7.2_.

7.3.  _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting under
any employee benefit plan of Parent, employees of the Surviving Corporation
shall receive service credit for service with the Company prior to the Closing
to the same extent such credit was granted under a Company Plan prior to the
Closing Date, including the applicability of minimum waiting periods for
participation in such plans. Except as provided in the last sentence of
_Section 2.8(d)(ii)_, nothing in this Agreement shall create any obligation
on the part of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue the
employment of any employee for any period following the Closing Date and
nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from altering, amending or terminating any of its employee benefit plans, or
the participation of any of its employees in such plans, at any time.

(b) Effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
the Company and the Subsidiary shall each take all action required to
terminate any and all of the retirement plans sponsored or maintained by the
Company or the Subsidiary including the Cymetrix Corporation Retirement Plan.
Parent agrees and acknowledges that the form and substance of such
resolutions have been reviewed and approved by Parent. Parent agrees and
acknowledges that evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of such
termination was delivered to Parent no later than the day prior to the
Closing Date.

7.4. _Collection of Receivables_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to collect the accounts and notes receivable
and work in process reflected in the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement (the " _Receivables_ ") in accordance with the billing and
collection practices presently applied by the Company in the collection of
its accounts and notes receivable, except that with respect to any particular
Receivable, the Surviving Corporation may make any adjustment, concession or
settlement which in the good faith judgment of the Company CEO is commercially
reasonable, except that the Surviving Corporation shall not commence
litigation to effect collection without the prior written consent of Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In connection with the
collections by the Surviving Corporation, if a payment is received from an
account debtor who has not designated the invoice being paid thereby, such
payment shall be applied to the earliest invoice outstanding with respect to
indebtedness of such account debtor, except for those invoices which are
subject to a dispute to the extent of such dispute.

 



57 (b) Parent shall, on or before twenty (20) days after the beginning of each
calendar month commencing with the second complete calendar month following
the Closing Date, deliver to the Securityholder Representative a written
report of the aggregate amount of the Receivables and the aggregate amount of
cash collections of the Receivables during the period from the Closing Date
through the date of such report.

(c) After giving effect to all adjustments, concessions and settlements made
and collection fees incurred, (i) if the Surviving Corporation has not
collected, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, an
amount equal to the excess of the Receivables over the allowance for doubtful
accounts shown on the Closing Date Net Working Capital Schedule (such excess
being referred to herein as the " _Net Amount of Receivables_ "), then the
Securityholder Representative shall pay to the Surviving Corporation
(first from the Advance Amount and, if such payment is greater than the
Advance Amount, from Securityholders) an amount equal to (x) the Net Amount of
Receivables _minus_ (y) the amount collected in cash (after giving effect to
the items set forth above by the Surviving Corporation during such 180-day
period in respect of the Receivables, and (ii) if the Surviving Corporation
has collected, within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date, an
amount in excess of the Net Amount of Receivables (such excess being referred
to herein as the " _Excess Receivables Amount_ "), then Parent shall (A)
deposit with the Escrow Agent to then pay to each Securityholder holding
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal
to such SecurityholderÂ’s Securityholder Percentage of the Excess Receivables
Amount, and (B) pay to the Surviving Corporation, for further distribution,
net of applicable withholding Tax, to each Securityholder holding Company
Options immediately prior to the Effective Time, an amount equal to such
SecurityholderÂ’s Securityholder Percentage of the Excess Receivables Amount;
_provided_ that the aggregate deposited or amount so paid pursuant to this
clause (ii) shall not exceed $225,000. Promptly after any payment pursuant to
clause (i) of this _Section 7.4(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall assign
to the Securityholder Representative the right to collect any Receivables
which were not so collected by the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, after the Closing Date, any Key Securityholder shall receive any
remittance from any account debtors with respect to the Receivables (other
than with respect to Receivables assigned to the Securityholder Representative

Claim would have a material adverse effect on the business or reputation of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent), then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Person Claim. In any such
case the Indemnitor shall cooperate in connection therewith and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, the Securityholder

69  matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Business prior to
the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded by Parent upon receipt of
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours. The
Securityholder Representative shall be solely responsible for any costs or
expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section 9.6_. If Parent shall
desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of
such six-year period, Parent shall, prior to such disposition, give the
Securityholder Representative a reasonable opportunity, at the Securityholder
RepresentativeÂ’s expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as
the Securityholder Representative may select.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Parent and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to any books and records (other
than books and records described on _Schedule 9.6_ ) relating to the Company,
the Subsidiary or the Business which any Securityholder or any of their
Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date. Such access shall be afforded
by each Securityholder and its Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours. Parent shall be solely responsible
for any costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this  _Section 9.6_.
If any Securityholder or any of its Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any
of such books and records (other than books and records described on _Schedule
9.6_ ) prior to the expiration of such six-year period, such Securityholder
shall, prior to such disposition, give Parent a reasonable opportunity, at
ParentÂ’s expense, to segregate and remove such books and records as Parent may
select.

 

9.7. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement and the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among any of the
parties hereto including the letter of intent, dated December 16, 2013, as
amended, by and among Parent, the Company, Michael Halberda, Jeffrey MacDonald
and Riordan, Lewis and Haden Equity Partners. This Agreement shall not
be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument signed by
the Securityholder Representative and by Parent.

9.8.  _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the remainder
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or any
other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be unreasonable.

9.9.  _Schedules_.

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the matters reflected in the
Schedules are not necessarily limited to the matters required by this
Agreement to be disclosed in the Schedules, (ii) the Schedules may include
certain items and information solely for informational purposes for the
convenience of the parties and (iii) the disclosure by the Key
Securityholders of any matter in the Schedules shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment by the Key Securityholders that the matter is
required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is
material. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules are not intended to imply that such amounts are within or
outside the ordinary course of business for purposes of this Agreement.

 



70 (b) If and to the extent any information required to be furnished in any
Schedule is contained in any other Schedule, such information shall be deemed
to be included in all Schedules to the extent that the relevance of any such
information to any other Schedule is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure without further investigation.

(c) The Key Securityholders have disclosed the information contained in the
Schedules solely for purposes of the Agreement, and no information contained
therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any party thereto to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Requirements of
Laws or breach of any agreement.

 

9.10. _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived, or the
time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties entitled to
the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently
authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is
authorized in writing by an authorized representative of such party.
The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right
of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver
of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any
other or subsequent breach.

 

9.11. _Expenses_. Each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident
to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and any related
agreements and to its performance and compliance with all agreements and
conditions contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with,
including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and
accountants;  _provided_ , _that_ except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the Company, the
Subsidiary and the Securityholders in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of counsel and accountants, are to be treated as Selling
Expenses to the extent unpaid at the Closing.

 

9.12. _Execution in Counterparts; Facsimile or Electronic Signatures_. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement, and shall become binding when two or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the Securityholder Representative and Parent. Any signature page delivered by
fax or electronic mail shall be binding to the same extent as an original
signature page. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, any party who
delivers such a signature page shall deliver an original counterpart to any
party who requests it.

9.13. _Enforcement of Agreement_. In the event of an action at law or in
equity between the parties hereto to enforce any of the provisions hereof, the
unsuccessful party to such litigation or proceeding shall pay to the
successful party all costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred therein by such successful party on trial and
appeal as adjudged by the court, and if such successful party or parties shall
recover judgment in any such action or proceeding, such costs, expenses and
attorneysÂ’ fees may be included as part of such judgment.

 



71 9.14. _Further Assurances_. From time to time following the Closing,
each party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, to the other parties such other instruments of conveyance and
transfer as a party may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to
more effectively consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and, in the case of any licenses, certificates, approvals, authorizations,
agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other commitments (a) which
cannot be transferred or assigned effectively without the consent of third
parties which consent has not been obtained prior to the Closing, to cooperate
with each other party at its request in endeavoring to obtain such consent
promptly, and if any such consent is unobtainable, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure to the Security Corporation the benefits thereof
in some other manner, or (b) which are otherwise not transferable or
assignable, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure to the
Surviving Corporation the benefits thereof in some other manner (including
the exercise of the rights of the Company thereunder). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign any license, certificate, approval,
authorization, agreement, contract, lease, easement or other commitment if an
attempted assignment thereof without the consent of a third party thereto
would constitute a breach thereof.

 

9.15. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law
provisions) of the State of Illinois, except to the extent the laws of the
State of Delaware are mandatorily applicable to the Merger.

 

9.16. _Time is of the Essence_. With respect to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

9.17. _Representation by Counsel_. Each of the Key Securityholders hereby
acknowledges (i) that he, she or it has consulted with or has had the
opportunity to consult with independent counsel of his, her or its own choice
concerning this Agreement and has been advised to do so, and (ii) that he, she
or it has read and understands the Agreement, is fully aware of its legal
effect and has entered into it freely based on his, her or its own judgment.

9.18. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each Key Securityholder, Securityholder
Representative, Parent and Merger Sub hereby irrevocably submit in any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby to the jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the
jurisdiction of any court of the State of Illinois located in Chicago and
waive any and all objections to jurisdiction that they may have under the
laws of the State of Illinois or the United States.

 



72 9.19. _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) Any dispute, controversy or claim (including any dispute arising under
_Article VIII_ of this Agreement but excluding (i) any dispute, controversy
or claim by Parent arising under _Section 7.1_, (ii) any dispute, controversy
or claim arising under _Section 2.7_, which shall be resolved pursuant to
_Section 2.7_ and (iii) any dispute, controversy or claim arising under
_Section 2.8_, which shall be resolved pursuant to _Section 2.8_), whether
based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal
theory (a " _Dispute_ ") between any Securityholder Group Member, on the one
hand, and any Parent Group Member, on the other hand, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any obligations hereunder or the relationship of
the parties under this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the
procedures described in this Section and, if necessary, _Section 9.20_. The
parties hereto agree to establish an internal hierarchy to facilitate
resolution of these issues as set forth below:

(b) Upon written request of either Parent, on the one hand, or the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, each will appoint a
designated representative whose task it will be to meet for the purpose of
endeavoring to resolve such Dispute.

(c) The designated representatives shall meet as often as the parties
reasonably deem necessary to discuss the Dispute in an effort to resolve the
Dispute without the necessity of any formal proceeding. During the
discussions, all reasonable requests by a party to another party for non-
privileged information reasonably related to the Dispute shall be honored in
order that each party may be fully advised of the other partyÂ’s position.

 

(d) Formal proceedings for the resolution of a Dispute may not be commenced
until the earlier of:

 

(i) the designated representatives concluding in good faith that amicable
resolution through continued negotiation of the Dispute does not appear
likely; or

(ii) the expiration of the fifteen (15) day period immediately following
the initial request to negotiate the Dispute;

_provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 9.19_ will not be construed to
prevent a party from instituting formal proceedings earlier to avoid the
expiration of any applicable limitations period, to preserve a superior
position with respect to other creditors or to seek temporary or preliminary
injunctive relief pursuant to  _Section 9.19_ or _Section 9.20_.

9.20. _Arbitration_.

 

(a) If resolution of the Dispute still cannot be achieved as contemplated by
_Section 9.19_, the Dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration
conducted in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with the then current
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS as modified by the
following provisions of this Agreement:

 

(b) If the amount in dispute exceeds $100,000, three neutral arbitrators shall
be selected by the parties from the JAMS panel list in accordance with the

selection of one neutral arbitrator by the parties shall be from the JAMS
panel list in accordance with appointment rules of the JAMS.

 

(c) The arbitration process shall be conducted on an expedited basis by the
JAMS office located in Chicago, Illinois. Proceedings in arbitration shall

filing of the Dispute. All hearings, unless otherwise agreed to by the
parties, shall be held in Chicago, Illinois.

(d) The arbitrator(s) may in his, her or their discretion order a pre-hearing
exchange of information, including production of documents, exchange of
summaries of testimony or exchange of statements of position or depositions.

 

(e) The arbitration proceedings and all testimony, filings, documents and
information relating to or presented during the arbitration proceedings shall
be disclosed exclusively for the purpose of facilitating the arbitration
process and for no other purpose and shall be deemed to be information subject
to the confidentiality provisions of _Section 9.2_ of this Agreement. 

(f) The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be made in a written opinion
containing a concise analysis of the basis upon which the award was made.

(g) A judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof.

 

(h) The parties agree to equally split, as between the Key Securityholders, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, split the cost of any
arbitration, including the administrative fee, the compensation of the
arbitrator(s) and the expenses of any witnesses or proof produced at the
direct request of the arbitrator(s).

 

(i) The parties shall each bear all their own costs and expenses, irrespective
of which party is the prevailing party in the arbitration.

 

(j) Notwithstanding the agreements contained in _Section 9.19_ and this
_Section 9.20_, either party may apply to a court having jurisdiction to (i)
enforce this agreement to arbitrate, (ii) seek provisional injunctive relief
so as to maintain the status quo until the arbitration award is rendered or
the controversy is otherwise resolved, (iii) avoid the expiration of any
applicable limitations period, (iv) preserve a superior position with respect
to other creditors, or (v) challenge or vacate any final judgment, award or
decision of the arbitrator(s) that does not comport with the express
provisions of subparagraph (l) below.

(k) The arbitrator(s) are only authorized to, and only have the consent of the
parties to, interpret and apply the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
accordance with the governing law. The arbitrator(s) are not authorized to,
and shall not, order any remedy not permitted by this Agreement and shall not
change any term or condition of this Agreement, deprive either party of any
remedy expressly provided hereunder or provide any right or remedy that has
not been expressly provided hereunder. In the event that the arbitrator(s)
exceed their authority under this Agreement and violate this provision,
either party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to vacate the
arbitration award on the grounds that the arbitrator(s) exceeded their
authority.

 

(l) The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 through 14 except as
modified hereby, shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this
_Section 9.20_.

 



74 (m) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to continue
performing their respective obligations under this Agreement while the
Dispute is being resolved unless and until such obligations are terminated or
expire in accordance with the provisions hereof.

 

9.21. _Conflicts; Privileges_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that the Company and the Securityholder Representative have retained
Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP (" _KMR_ ") to act as their counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that KMR has not acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and that no other party to this Agreement or Person has the status of a
client of KMR for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result
thereof. Parent hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Surviving Corporation and any of its Affiliates) and the Securityholder
Representative or any Key Securityholder, KMR may represent the Securityholder
Representative or any Key Securityholder in such dispute even though the
interests of the Securityholder Representative or such Key Securityholder may
be directly adverse to Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation), and even though KMR may have represented
the Surviving Corporation in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
Parent (i) hereby waives, on behalf of itself and the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Affiliates, any claim they have or may have that KMR has a
conflict of interest in connection with or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation, and (ii) agrees that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) and the
Securityholder Representative or any Key Securityholder, KMR may represent the
Securityholder Representative or such Key Securityholder in such dispute even
though the interest of the Securityholder Representative or such Key
Securityholder may be directly adverse to Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) and even though KMR
may have represented the Surviving Corporation in a matter substantially
related to such dispute. Parent further agrees that, as to all communications
among KMR, the Surviving Corporation, the Key Securityholders and the
Securityholder Representative or any of their Affiliates or representatives
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all
other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to the Securityholder
Representative and may be controlled by the Securityholder Representative and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The
Securityholder Representative, the Surviving Corporation and Parent further
agree that KMR and its partners and employees are third-party beneficiaries
of this _Section 9.21_.

9.22. _Judicial Procedure_. Nothing in  _Sections 9.19_ or _9.20_ shall be
construed to prevent any party from seeking from a court of competent
jurisdiction a temporary restraining order or other temporary or preliminary
relief pending final resolution of a Dispute pursuant to such _Sections
9.19_ or _9.20_.

9.23. _Securityholder Representative_. Each of the Securityholders hereby
irrevocably constitutes, designates and appoints Michael Halberda as the sole
representative, agent and attorney for and on behalf of each Securityholder
and each Securityholder Group Member (the " _Securityholder Representative_
") to (a) represent and act for it, him or her for all purposes relating to,
make any and all determinations and agreements in connection with, and take or
refrain from taking any other actions for and on his, her or its behalf
pursuant to, this Agreement,

 



75  any Securityholder Ancillary Agreement (other than the Amended and Restated
Employment Agreements and the Non-Competition Agreements), any Company
Ancillary Agreement or any Parent Ancillary Agreement, (b) give and receive
notices and communications, organize or assume defense of third-party claims,
agree to, negotiate, or enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to third-party claims including pursuant to _Article VIII_ and
_Sections 9.19_ and _9.20_ , (c) take or refrain from taking any other actions
specified in this Agreement, any Securityholder Ancillary Agreement (other
than the Amended and Restated Employment Agreements and the Non-Competition
Agreements), any Company Ancillary Agreement or any Parent Ancillary Agreement
to be taken by any Securityholder, the Securityholder Representative or
any Securityholder Group Member, (d) authorize releases from the Escrow
Account, and (e) to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, any
Securityholder Ancillary Agreement (other than the Amended and Restated
Employment Agreements and the Non-Competition Agreements), any Company
Ancillary Agreement or any Parent Ancillary Agreement. Any decision, act,
consent, agreement or instruction of the Securityholder Representative shall
constitute a decision, act, consent, agreement or instruction of each
Securityholder and each Securityholder Group Member and shall be
final, binding and conclusive and Parent may rely upon the same. This
appointment and grant of power and authority is coupled with an interest and
is in consideration of the mutual covenants made herein and is irrevocable and
shall not be terminated by any act of the Securityholders or by operation of
law, whether by death or incapacity of any Securityholder or by the occurrence
of any other event. Each Securityholder hereby consents to the taking of any
and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be
taken or made by Securityholder Representative pursuant to this _Section
9.23_. If Michael Halberda or any successor to such person as the
Securityholder Representative dies or is unwilling or unable to serve as the
Securityholder Representative, then the Securityholders hereby agree that
Jeffrey MacDonald shall be appointed as the successor to act as the
Securityholder Representative. Notices or communications to or from the
Securityholder Representative hereunder shall constitute notice to or from
each of the Securityholders. Each Securityholder shall, in proportion to such
SecurityholderÂ’s respective Securityholder Percentage (other than any matters
involving less than all of the Securityholders for which the applicable
Securityholders shall bear their respective pro rata share of such costs and
expenses), pay or reimburse the Stockholder Representative, upon presentation
of an invoice, for all costs and expenses of the Stockholder Representative
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel to the
Stockholder Representative) in connection with: (i) the enforcement of this
Agreement and/or any Securityholder Ancillary Agreement (other than
the Amended and Restated Employment Agreements and the Non-Competition
Agreements), any Company Ancillary Agreement or any Parent Ancillary Agreement
and/or the protection or preservation of the rights of each Securityholder
and/or the Securityholders against Parent, or any of their respective assets,
and (ii) any amendment, modification or waiver of any of the terms of this
Agreement and/or any Securityholder Ancillary Agreement (other than the
Amended and Restated Employment Agreements and the Non-Competition
Agreements), any Company Ancillary Agreement or any Parent Ancillary Agreement
(whether or not any such amendment, modification or waiver is signed or
becomes effective) (collectively, the " _Securityholder
Representative Expenses_ "). Such amounts shall first be paid out of an
advance amount equal to One Million Dollars ($1,000,000)

 



76  (together with any interest thereon, the " _Advance Amount_ "), which will
be delivered by Parent to the Securityholder Representative at Closing as a
deduction from the Estimated Cash Closing Consideration and which the
Securityholder Representative may maintain in a separate account for
application under this _Section 9.23_. Any portion of the Advance Amount
remaining after final settlement of the Contingent Payment pursuant to
_Section 2.8_ and payment of the Securityholder Representative Expenses shall
be distributed to the Securityholders in proportion to their respective
Securityholder Percentages. In addition, the Securityholder Representative
may reduce any amounts distributed under the Escrow Agreement to the
Securityholders for any amounts due by the Securityholders under this _Section
9.23_. The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable to
any Securityholder for any action or omission taken or omitted to be taken by
the Securityholder Representative in good faith under this Agreement, and each
Securityholder, in proportion to their respective Securityholder Percentages
(other than any claims involving less than all of the Securityholders for
which the applicable Securityholders shall bear their respective pro rata
share of such costs and expenses), for itself and for his, her or its heirs,
executors, legal representatives and assigns, hereby agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Securityholder Representative from and against any and all
claims that may arise against the Securityholder Representative by reason of
the Securityholder RepresentativeÂ’s actions or inactions hereunder in its
capacity as the Securityholder Representative (except in the case of fraud or
intentional or willful misconduct on the part of the Securityholder
Representative) or against the Securityholder Representative, in its capacity
as such, by reason of such SecurityholderÂ’s fraud, misrepresentation, breach
of representation or warranty or non-fulfillment of any obligation of such
Securityholder contained in this Agreement. In the event any Securityholder
(a " _Defaulting Securityholder_ ") fails to indemnify the Securityholder
Representative within sixty (60) days of the date of demand by the
Securityholder Representative for such indemnity, the other Securityholders
shall, in proportion to their respective Securityholder Percentages (other
than any claims involving less than all of the Securityholders for which the
applicable Securityholders shall bear their respective pro rata share), make
such indemnity payment and shall be subrogated to the rights of the
Securityholder Representative against the Defaulting Securityholder to the
extent of such payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, if any of the loans made by the Company to directors, officers or
employees described in _Section 3.2(k)_ are not repaid within seven (7) days
after the Closing Date, the Securityholder Representative shall purchase from
the Surviving Corporation, using funds from the Advance Amount, each such
loan which is not so repaid, for an amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount thereof.
