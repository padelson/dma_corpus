 (a) Not later than the Closing Date, the Seller shall establish an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with an independent financial institution willing to serve as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Save with respect to any claims pursuant to _Section 4.1_, such account shall serve as Purchaser\'s sole recourse following the Closing Date with respect to all claims under or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. At the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver the Escrow Amount in cash to the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow Account.

For the avoidance of doubt, following the release of any amounts owed to Purchaser from the Escrow Account, Purchaser shall have no rights to any funds remaining in the Escrow Account thereafter or with respect to any Claims giving rise to the release of funds to the Purchaser from the Escrow Account. The Purchaser acknowledges that Seller plans to liquidate, dissolve and distribute all assets (including the Purchase Price) promptly upon Closing and, in the absence of any claims pursuant to _Section 4.1_, agrees to take no action that would impair, impede or delay the foregoing. 

  

      

  7.2 _Dispute Resolution_.

  

  

 (a) One of the persons listed on _Annex 7.2_ shall serve as the expert (the " _Expert_ ") for purposes of dispute resolution hereunder. Promptly following the date hereof the parties shall contact each of such persons to confirm their willingness to serve as Expert hereunder, shall provide such persons with a copy of this Agreement and enter into a customary engagement letter with such person to so serve if so requested (not to provide for a retainer in excess of $20,000 per person). Any such retainer shall be borne equally by the parties. In the event that any such person cannot so confirm, the parties shall promptly jointly select another renowned international arbitrator for the list acting reasonably. 

  

 (b) On or before the 75th calendar day following the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Notification Date_ "), the Purchaser shall notify the Seller, in a single writing and in reasonable detail, of any Claims (the " _Purchaser\'s Notification_ "). Within two (2) calendar days thereafter, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with its preliminary view on each of the items raised in the Purchaser\'s Notification and with any claims it may have against the Purchaser relating to this Agreement that it chooses to bring under the process set out in this Section (the " _Seller\'s Notification_ "). Immediately after delivery of the Seller\'s Notification, the Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve any disagreements with respect to items included in the Purchaser\'s Notification or the Seller\'s Notification. It is agreed and understood that in no event shall either Party be entitled to delay under this section, including any delay in making the Expert Submissions. Failing such a resolution, any disagreements shall be definitively resolved by the Expert, who shall be instructed to render his or her decision by the specified date (the " _Decision Date_ "), as hereinafter set forth in this _Section 7.2_. No later than the 5th calendar day following Purchaser\'s receipt of the Seller\'s Notification (i.e. on the 80th day following the Closing Date), the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit to the first person named in _Annex 7.2_ , as the Expert, their aggregate position on all items raised in the Purchaser\'s Notification or the Seller\'s Notification (i.e., a single number that represents the value of all such items), together with any other documents reasonably relevant to the disputed items that they would like to submit to the Expert, in each case with a copy (delivered not later than 9.00 a.m., London time, on the following calendar day) to the other Party and its lawyers (the " _Expert Submissions_ "). The Expert shall be instructed that the Decision Date shall be the 89th calendar day following the Closing Date, i.e. that he must render his decision by no later than 5 p.m. in London, England on such date. The Expert upon rendering his or her decision by the 89th calendar day after the Closing Date shall be entitled to a success fee of $100,000 which shall be borne by the loser of the arbitration. The Experts shall be utilized in the order listed on _Annex 7.2_. In the event that any person listed on _Annex 7.2_ is unable, unavailable or unprepared to act as the Expert when designated to do so pursuant to the foregoing, such person shall not be so designated and instead the next person on _Annex 7.2_ shall on the same day be designated as the Expert. The Parties shall be precluded from, and hereby waive any right to, directly or indirectly, delay or extend, or seek to delay or extend, the timeframe for the above described process for any reason including grounds of unfairness, insufficient time or insufficient record. The Purchaser shall cause the Group Companies to provide the Expert, the Seller and the accountants of the Seller access to all information (including personnel) that may be relevant to a determination under this Section, upon reasonable request, at all times following the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances shall the above process extend beyond the 89th calendar day following the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) The Expert shall be permitted to assess all relevant facts and circumstances with respect to a dispute properly submitted to him or her and the Parties shall, and shall cause the Group Companies, to comply with all requests for personnel and documents by the Expert. The Expert may use whatever process including submissions from or appearances by the Parties (or others, to the extent possible) as the Expert requires. If and to the extent legal (or accounting) issues are in 

  

      

  
  

dispute or are otherwise relevant in the judgment of the Expert, the Expert
may consult with a lawyer or law firm (or accountant or accounting firm) in
Switzerland (as well as, if the Expert deems appropriate, in the United
Kingdom or United States), all of whom shall be independent of the Parties.
However, in rendering its decision and any award with respect to any item, the
Expert shall only be permitted to choose between the Seller\'s and the
Purchaser\'s respective single amounts set forth in the Expert Submissions,
and shall not be permitted to render a decision that does not conform in all
respects with either Seller\'s or Purchaser\'s respective amounts sought.

  

 (d) The cost of involving the Experts, including any costs incurred by the Experts pursuant to this clause _Section 7.2_, shall be paid by the loser of the arbitration proceeding. 

  

 (e) Any amounts payable to the Seller as a result of the procedures set forth in this _Section 7.2_ shall be paid upon order by the Expert within two (2) Business Days of the relevant final determination in the manner set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_. Any amounts due to Purchaser as a result of the award under this _Section 7.2_ shall only be payable to Purchaser from the Escrow Account. 

  

 (f) For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any claim by Seller for all or a portion of the Purchase Price, Default Interest, any other interest accrued hereunder, and/or any other amounts to be paid to the Seller under or relating to this Agreement may be brought in Seller\'s discretion to the Expert, an arbitration under _Section 11.4_ or in the courts generally and shall not be subject to the limitations applicable to Purchaser\'s ability to recover.  

  

  

 7.3 _Indemnity_. 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date the Seller shall have no liability in respect of this Agreement, except for fraud or any intentional and material breach of a covenant. Upon the Closing, all covenants of the Seller shall terminate except as otherwise set forth below. 

  

 (b) Save with respect to any Claims pursuant to _Section 4.1_, Purchaser\'s sole and exclusive remedy or recourse with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or under this Agreement shall be to make a claim for Purchaser\'s direct Loss (a " _Claim_ ") against the Escrow Account and, subject to the other limitations provided herein and in the Escrow Agreement. A Claim may only be for: 

    

 (i) a breach of warranty to the extent that such breach is shown to be material and to have been made with scienter by Seller; 

  

 (ii) a breach of the covenants set out in _Sections 3.2 and 3.3 _to the extent that such breach is shown to be intentional and material; or 

  

 (iii) any breach of _Section 3.1_. 

    

The resulting compensation for Loss shall be determined either by agreement
of the Parties or by decision of the Expert pursuant to _Section 7.2_. The
adjustment of all such Claims, as so determined, is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Determined Claim Amount_ ", and shall be an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

  

Save with respect to any Claims pursuant to _Section 4.1_, in no event shall
the Purchaser have any claim in respect of any of the foregoing or otherwise
against any source other than the Escrow Account.

  

In addition to any Determined Claim Amount, the loser of the arbitration
proceeding shall pay to the other Party a penalty (as a discouragement to
bringing losing claims) equal to 50% of the difference between the respective
amounts sought in the Party\'s Expert Submissions.

  

      

  
  

 (c) Purchaser\'s right to compensation hereunder shall be subject to the following limitations: 

    

 (i) Compensation shall be available for any individual Claim only to the extent that compensable Loss on such Claim exceeds CHF 3.5 million (the " _De Minimis Amount_ "); and for all Claims only to the extent that compensable loss on such Claims exceeds CHF 15 million; 

  

 (ii) Compensation for all Claims shall in no event exceed the Escrow Amount; 

  

 (iii) all Claims shall be reduced to the extent that Purchaser, the Group Companies or any of their respective affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, other than the Seller) have a claim in respect thereof such as a claim against a third party, any applicable insurance or any related tax benefit such as loss deductions, refunds or losses carried forward, but only to the extent that recoveries in respect of such claim or benefit could reasonably be expected to be realized in due course by the Purchaser or the Group Companies and taking into account differences in the likely timing of the underlying Loss and the date such recovery is likely to be realized; 

   

 (iv) no compensation shall be available to Purchaser with respect to any Claim to the extent that such Claim arises from an act, event, default, omission, transaction or arrangement of the Seller or the Purchaser prior to Closing Date occurring at the request of the Purchaser or its affiliates or in connection with the performance of this Agreement; and 

  

 (v) no Claim shall be compensable without proof by the Purchaser that as a result of the underlying breach of warranty or covenant the Purchaser has paid more for the Shares than it otherwise would have paid. 

   

  

 7.4 _Exclusion of Further Remedies_. 

  

 Save with respect to any Claims under _Section 4.1_, the Parties agree that the Purchaser\'s right to an adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement supersede and replace any statutory rights, warranties or guaranties of the Purchaser under applicable law, and that Purchaser\'s right to an adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be the exclusive remedy available to the Purchaser. Any claims resulting from statutory Purchaser\'s rights, warranties or guaranties are herewith excluded to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

  

 7.5 _No Double Relief_. 

  

 All remedies, including the claim for specific performance under this Agreement, shall be cumulative and not alternative, except as expressly agreed to the contrary between the Parties. The Purchaser, however, shall not be entitled to any compensation for a Claim to the extent that the fact or circumstance giving rise to such adjustment (other than fraud) benefited the Group or benefited any Group Company\'s ability to recover from a third party. 

  

 7.6 _Mitigation_. 

  

 The Purchaser (following the Closing Date) shall use and shall cause the Group Companies to use reasonable best efforts to mitigate and minimize the amount of loss relating to any Claim (including without limitation by offering Seller opportunity to cure). 

  

 7.7 _Matters Arising Subsequent to this Agreement_. 

  

 The Seller shall not be liable under this Agreement in respect of any matter to the extent that the same would not have occurred but for: 

  

  

 (a) _Agreed matters_ : Any matter or thing done or omitted to be done pursuant to and in compliance with this Agreement or otherwise at the request in writing or with the approval in writing of the Purchaser.

 (c) _Accounting and Taxation Policies_ : Any change in accounting or taxation policy, bases or practice of the Purchaser or any of the Group Companies introduced or having effect after Signing. 

  

 (d) _Purchaser\'s Act or Omission_ : Any voluntary act or omission by the Purchaser or the Company after Signing (including but not limited to omission of appropriate insurance coverage policies in order to maintain insurance at level prior completion of this Agreement). 

  

  

 7.8 _Survival_. 

   

 The warranties of Seller shall not survive the Closing Date (the foregoing shall be without prejudice to any right to bring a Claim under this _Section 7_ following the Closing Date). 

  

Section 8. _Conditions Precedent._

  

 8.1 _Conditions to the Obligations of the Parties_. 

  

 The obligations of the Parties to consummate the purchase and sale of the Shares are subject to:

 8.2 _Election to Extend_. 

  

  

 (a) In the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1 _have been satisfied or waived at any time before the 45th Day, then: 

    

 (i) the Purchaser shall have the option (to be exercised by delivering written notice to the Seller) to delay Closing until the 45th Day (or such earlier date as it may notify to the Seller in writing with at least 3 Business Days\' notice) in order to continue to work on the US GAAP Financial Statements; and 

   

 (ii) as from the Unconditional Date until the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller interest on an amount equal to the Purchase Price less the Deposit at a rate of 12 per cent. per annum, such interest to be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed; _provided_ , that such interest shall not be payable if the Closing occurs on the Business Day immediately following the Unconditional Date. 

    

 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ have been satisfied or waived, Closing shall take place no later than the 45th Day regardless of whether the US GAAP Financial Statements have been signed off and presented to the Purchaser. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no conditions to Closing, constructive or otherwise, after the Unconditional Date.

If such conditions have not been fulfilled or waived by the 45th Day (or by such later date as the Parties may mutually agree in writing), then on the calendar day following the 45th Day either the Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be, may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect, save that if either of such conditions has not been fulfilled by such date as a result of a Party failing to use all reasonable endeavours to procure the satisfaction of any such condition or has materially breached any of their covenants under this Agreement, such Party shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated, then, save for the operative provisions in this _Section 8.3_ and _Section 11_: (i) all other provisions shall cease to be effective; and (ii) no Party shall have any rights against the other Party hereunder except in respect of any material breach of a covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a termination of this Agreement other than as a result of Seller\'s breach of covenant, Seller shall be entitled to retain the Deposit in addition to any rights it may have to recover at law; _provided_ , that if this Agreement is terminated and Purchaser has not materially breached any obligation hereunder, and the Closing did not occur solely by virtue of failure to satisfy the condition set out in _Section 8.1(b)_, then the Seller shall return the Deposit to the Purchaser upon such termination.
