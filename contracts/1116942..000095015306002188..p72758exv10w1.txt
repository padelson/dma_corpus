requisite consent is obtained therefor and the same is transferred and assigned
to Purchaser, the Parties shall cooperate with each other, upon written request
of Purchaser, in endeavoring to obtain for Purchaser, at no cost to Sellers or
any of their Affiliates, an arrangement with respect thereto to provide for
Purchaser substantially comparable benefits therein, and Purchaser agrees to
indemnify Sellers and their respective Affiliates in respect of all Liabilities

         (c) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to the Real Property
Leases, Equipment Leases, Intellectual Property Licenses, Assumed Contracts,
Contracts, Permits or rights and that such consents have not been and may not be
obtained. Purchaser agrees that neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates
shall have any liability whatsoever arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any consents that may have been or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the default under, or
acceleration or termination of, any Real Property Lease, Equipment Lease,
Intellectual Property License or Assumed Contract, Contract, Permit or right, as
a result thereof. Purchaser further agrees that no representation, warranty or
covenant of Sellers contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached, and
no condition to Purchaser's obligations to close the transactions contemplated

default, acceleration or termination; or (ii) any lawsuit, action, claim,
proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any
Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any
such default, acceleration or termination.

purchase price of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars
($225,600,000) (the "Gross Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.8 (as so adjusted, the "Aggregate Purchase Price"). The Gross Purchase
Price shall be allocated as described in Section 2.9.

         (b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,

writing to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing.

         (a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than
ten (10) days following the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to
Purchaser (i) a statement of

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

the Working Capital at the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the Business
Accounting Principles (the "Working Capital Statement"), and (ii) a calculation
of the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Conveyed Companies and of the
Asset Selling Entities to the extent actually transferred to Purchaser at the
Closing Date (the "Cash Statement"), Purchaser shall give representatives of
Sellers access, during normal business hours, to the premises, books and records
and appropriate personnel of the Business and the Conveyed Companies for
purposes of the preparation of the Working Capital Statement.

         (b) Purchaser and Purchaser's accountants and financial and other
advisors may make reasonable inquiries of Sellers and/or their accountants
regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Working Capital
Statement and the Cash Statement arising in the course of such review. Purchaser
and Purchaser's accountants shall complete their review of the Working Capital
Statement and the Cash Statement within fifteen (15) days after the delivery
thereof to Purchaser. Promptly following completion of their review (but in no
event later than two (2) Business Days following the conclusion of such fifteen
(15) day period), Purchaser shall submit to Sellers a letter regarding its
concurrence or disagreement with the accuracy of the Working Capital Statement
and/or the Cash Statement; provided that if Purchaser submits a letter of
disagreement, such letter will specify the items of the Working Capital
Statement and/or the Cash Statement with which it disagrees. Unless Purchaser
delivers a letter disagreeing with the accuracy of the Working Capital Statement
and/or the Cash Statement, including a description of the specific items of the
Working Capital Statement with which it disagrees, within two (2) Business Days
following the conclusion of such fifteen (15) day period, the Working Capital
Statement and the Cash Statement shall be final and binding upon the Parties.
Following delivery of such a letter so disagreeing, Sellers and Purchaser shall
attempt in good faith to resolve promptly any disagreement as to the computation
of any item in the Working Capital Statement and/or the Cash Statement, and any
items as to which there is no disagreement shall be deemed agreed. If a
resolution of such disagreement has not been effected within ten (10) days (or
longer, as mutually agreed by the Parties) after delivery of such letter, then
Sellers and Purchaser shall submit any disagreement regarding the Working
Capital Statement and/or the Cash Statement (a "Disputed Item") to the Los
Angeles, California office of Ernst & Young (the "Accountant") for
determination. The determination of the Accountant with respect to any Disputed
Item shall be completed within ten (10) days after the appointment of the
Accountant and shall be determined in accordance with this Agreement, and shall
be final and binding upon the Parties. With respect to each Disputed Item, the
Accountant shall adopt a position that is either equal to Purchaser's proposed
position, equal to Sellers' proposed position, or between the positions proposed
by Sellers and Purchaser. Working Capital as finally determined in accordance
herewith shall be referred to as "Closing Date Working Capital" and Cash and
Cash Equivalents of the Conveyed Companies and of the Asset Selling Entities to
the extent actually transferred to Purchaser at the Closing Date, as finally
determined in accordance herewith, shall be referred to as "Closing Date Cash
and Cash Equivalents." The fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant shall be
borne and paid by the Party that the Accountant determines to be least correct
(in net dollar terms) in the aggregate in its determination of the Disputed
Items.

         (c) If the Closing Date Working Capital is less than Sixty Million

Working Capital. If the Closing Date Working Capital exceeds Seventy Million
Dollars ($70,000,000), then Purchaser shall be obligated to pay, or cause to be
paid, to Sellers the amount of any such excess within five (5) Business Days
after the determination of the Closing Date Working Capital. Purchaser shall
also be obligated to pay to Sellers the amount of the Closing Date Cash and Cash
Equivalents within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Closing
Date Cash and Cash Equivalents. Any such payments shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated in writing by Purchaser
or Sellers, as the case may be. Any payment made pursuant to this Section 2.8(c)
shall be made with interest (such interest to be calculated on the basis of a

such amount from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to
eight percent (8%) per annum.

            Section 2.9. Purchase Price Allocation.

         (a) Sellers and Purchaser (i) have agreed to the allocation of the
Gross Purchase Price as set forth on Schedule 2.9(a)(i) (the "Section 2.9(a)(i)
Allocation"), (ii) shall agree prior to the Closing to an allocation of the
Assumed Liabilities to be set forth on Schedule 2.9(a)(ii) (the "Section
2.9(a)(ii) Allocation"), and (iii) shall agree within forty-five (45) days after
Closing as set forth below on a further allocation among the Purchased Assets
sold by each Asset Selling Entity (that incorporates, reflects and is consistent
with the Section 2.9(a)(i) Allocation and the Section 2.9(a)(ii) Allocation) to
be set forth on Schedule 2.9(a)(iii) (the "Section 2.9(a)(iii) Allocation").
Each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall (a) be
bound by the Section 2.9(a)(i) Allocation, the Section 2.9(a)(ii) Allocation and
the Section 2.9(a)(iii) Allocation (collectively the "Allocations") for purposes
of determining any Taxes; (b) prepare and file, and cause its Affiliates to
prepare and file, their respective Tax Returns on a basis consistent with the
Allocations; and (c) take no position, and cause its Affiliates to take no
position, inconsistent with the Allocations on any applicable Tax Return or in
any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or otherwise, in each case except to
the extent required pursuant to a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)
of the Code). In the event that any of the Allocations is disputed by any Taxing
Authority, the Party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the
other Parties hereto, and Sellers and Purchaser agree to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to defend such Allocation in any audit or similar proceeding.
Sellers and Purchaser agree that Purchaser shall prepare the Section 2.9(a)(iii)
Allocation. Purchaser shall provide Sellers with a copy of Purchaser's proposed
Section 2.9(a)(iii) Allocation within forty (40) calendar days after the
Closing. Sellers shall notify Purchaser of any disagreement within five (5) days
of Sellers' receipt of Purchaser's proposed Section 2.9(a)(iii) Allocation. The
Parties shall endeavor to resolve any such disagreement in good faith. To the
extent that there is any post-Closing payment pursuant to the determination of
Closing Date Working Capital or Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, the
amount of such payment shall be allocated to the Equity Interests or the
Purchased Assets, as applicable, to which the item relates on a gross basis (for
the avoidance of doubt, such items may be positive or negative without regard to
whether the adjustment pursuant to Section 2.8, is positive or negative) and
shall be further allocated among the Purchased Assets in the same proportions as
the Section 2.9(a)(iii) Allocation to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

         (b) If Sellers and Purchaser fail to agree on the Section 2.9(a)(iii)
Allocation, such matter shall be resolved pursuant to the procedures provided in
Section 6.11.

            Section 5.3. Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Certain Governmental
Matters.

         (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each
of the Parties agrees to cooperate and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary for it to do under applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, including the satisfaction of the respective
conditions set forth in Articles VII and VIII. Each of the Parties will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or transfer any and all Permits and
any and all licenses, consents and approvals of all third parties, and make all
necessary filings under the Connecticut Transfer of Establishments Act, Conn.
Gen. State 22a-134 et seq. (the "Transfer Act") and Section 22a-6o of the
Connecticut General Statutes (the "Permit Transfer Statute"), as are necessary
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limitation of the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to post any
security deposit or parent guarantee reasonably requested by the lessor(s) of
any Leased Real Property in connection with the assignment of the lease thereof
to Purchaser and the release of Sellers and their Affiliates from any liability
or obligation

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

thereunder following the Closing. All fees and expenses incurred by the Parties
in connection with obtaining such Permits and such licenses, consents and
approvals shall be borne by the Party incurring such costs and treated in
accordance with Section 11.8. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
Parties shall take all actions necessary to obtain such Permits and such
licenses, consents and approvals including (i) entering into negotiations with
any Governmental Authority, (ii) promptly complying with (or properly seeking to
reduce the scope of) all formal or informal requests for additional information
or documentary material received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from any
Governmental Authority, (iii) promptly making proposals to any Governmental
Authority, and (iv) keeping the other Parties informed of any material
communication with any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the

actions listed in clauses (i)-(iv) of this Section 5.3(a) which would reasonably
be expected to materially and adversely impact the Business.

         (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees
to assume any and all obligations of Sellers under the Transfer Act for the
current ongoing environmental activities at the Stafford and Staffordville, CT
facilities and in this regard agrees to submit all appropriate documentation to
the appropriate Governmental Authority to assume such obligations. Purchaser
also agrees that it will assume any and all obligations under the Transfer Act
that arise from execution of this Agreement and the transferred facilities
located in the State of Connecticut, including the filing of appropriate
documentation with appropriate Governmental Authorities and designating itself
or any entity controlled by Purchaser that meets the definition of "Party
associated with the transfer of an Establishment" as defined in Conn. Gen. Stat.
Section 22a-134(7), as the Certifying Party. Also, with the exception of
non-transferable permits and general permits, any environmental permits for
facilities located in Connecticut will need to be transferred pursuant to the
Permit Transfer Statute. At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing,
Purchaser shall submit a completed Permit Transfer Form and all required
documentation to the applicable Governmental Authorities in order to obtain such
Governmental Authority's approval to transfer the environmental Permits.

         (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties
shall, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof, make any filings with the Federal Trade Commission and
the Department of Justice as may be required pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the acquisition of the Equity Interests and the Purchased Assets, and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, by Purchaser. Purchaser shall pay all
filing fees required by the HSR Act; provided, that if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(a), or 10.1(d), or by Sellers pursuant to
Section 10.1(b) or 10.1(c), then Sellers shall promptly reimburse Purchaser for
fifty percent (50%) of all such HSR Act filing fees.

         (d) Each of the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another,
and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Competition Laws. Each of the Parties will
(i) promptly notify the other Party of any written communication to that Party
from any Governmental Authority located in the U.S. and, to the extent
practicable, outside of the U.S. and, subject to applicable Law, if practicable,
permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any such Governmental Authority and

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

incorporate the other Party's reasonable comments, (ii) not agree to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion with any such Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably practicable,
it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend, and
(iii) furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
written communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and any such Governmental Authority or its
respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

         (e) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other
proceeding is commenced which threatens or questions the validity or legality of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the Parties agree to cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to defend against such claim, action, suit,
investigation or other proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued
in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted,
and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

            Section 5.4. Non-EU Business Employees and Employee Benefits.

         (a) With respect to any Non-EU Business Employee, within a reasonable
period of time (but not less than seven (7) days) prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall offer employment to each Non-EU Business Employee (or, in the
case of Non-EU Business Employees employed by Conveyed Companies, to cause such
Conveyed Companies to offer to continue the employment of each of their Non-EU
Business Employees), commencing as of the Closing Date, in the same job or
position and the same or similar location (for these purposes, "same or similar
location" means any location within twenty (20) miles of such employee's current
work location) as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (x) at a
rate of pay at least equal to, (y) with severance entitlements substantially
comparable to, and (z) with other employee benefits and terms and conditions of
employment (including benefits pursuant to qualified and non-qualified
retirement and savings plans, medical, life insurance, disability, dental and
pharmaceutical plans and programs, deferred compensation arrangements, but
excluding equity-based and incentive compensation plans), substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the rate of pay, severance entitlements and
other employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment, respectively,
provided to the Non-EU Business Employee, or to which the Non-EU Business
Employee would be entitled upon commencing employment with the applicable Asset
Selling Entity, Conveyed Company or applicable Affiliate of Sellers, immediately
prior to the Closing Date; provided that, for purposes of this Section 5.4,
policies for holidays, paid vacation and sick days shall not be considered
employee benefits or terms and conditions of employment for periods commencing
after December 31, 2006; and provided, further, that Purchaser shall not be
deemed in breach of the foregoing covenant as a result of any failure by
Sellers, during the term of the Transition Services Agreement - Employee
Benefits and Payroll Services, to provide any services thereunder as to which
the applicable vendor consent is not obtained, unless such failure is the result
of Purchaser's unreasonable withholding of consent to any alternative means of
providing such services, as contemplated by Section 2 of such Transition
Services Agreement. For purposes of this Section 5.4, "pay" shall include base

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

salary or wages plus any commission, premium pay, overtime and shift
differentials. Purchaser, at the time it extends such employment offers, shall
provide appropriate information regarding employment terms and conditions to the
Non-EU Business Employees, which shall conform in all respects to the provisions
of this Section 5.4. Each Non-EU Business Employee who accepts such offer of
employment or continued employment shall become an employee of Purchaser or its
Affiliates on the Closing Date and is referred to herein as a "Transferred
Employee," and all such employees collectively are referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees." Purchaser acknowledges that by purchasing the capital
stock of the Conveyed Companies, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall employ all
Non-EU Business Employees of the Conveyed Companies commencing as of the Closing
Date, and such Non-EU Business Employees shall be Transferred Employees for
purposes of this Agreement. For a period of at least one (1) year following the
Closing Date, Purchaser covenants and agrees to, or to cause its Affiliates to,
maintain unchanged and continue to provide each Transferred Employee with the
pay, severance and benefits described in this Section 5.4(a).

         (b) With respect to Transferred Employees employed in the U.S.,
Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided, effective commencing on the
Closing Date, health benefits coverage to all such Transferred Employees.

         (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, have in effect for at least one (1)
year following the Closing Date severance and retention plans, practices and
policies applicable to all Transferred Employees on the Closing Date that are
not less favorable than such practices and policies in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date with respect to such employees, and Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates from any severance or
retention liabilities or obligations with respect to such employees effective on
and after the Closing Date; (ii) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, ensure that all Transferred Employees who were notified of their target
bonuses (under the Management Incentive Plan, Sales Incentive Plan and/or
Performance Based Plan of Sellers or their Affiliates) for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2006, and who meet the performance targets, if any,
established at the time of such notification, receive annual bonuses at least
equal to such targets; and (iii) for periods commencing after December 31, 2006,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, ensure that all Transferred
Employees are provided with equity-based and incentive compensation, paid
vacation, sick days and paid time off on terms and conditions at least as
favorable as those provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates.

         (d) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its Affiliates to: (i) honor, pay, perform and satisfy any and all liabilities,
obligations and responsibilities to, or in respect of, each Transferred Employee
arising under the terms of any employment, consulting, retention, severance,
change-of-control or similar agreement disclosed on any of Sellers' Schedules to
this Agreement, and in accordance with the terms thereof in effect on the
Closing Date; (ii) assume, honor and be solely responsible for paying, providing
and satisfying when due (A) all vacation, personal days, sick pay and other paid
time off for Transferred Employees accrued but unused as of the Closing Date, on
terms and conditions not less favorable than the terms and conditions in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date but only to the extent such liabilities
are properly reflected in the Working Capital Statement, and (B) with respect to
periods commencing on and after the Closing Date, all compensation

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

(including salary, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive compensation,
overtime, premium pay and shift differentials), vacation, personal days, sick
pay and other paid time off, benefits and benefit claims, severance and
termination pay, notice and benefits under all applicable Laws and under any
plan, policy, practice or agreement and all other Liabilities, in each case
accruing, incurred, or arising as a result of employment or separation from
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, with respect to Transferred
Employees. Sellers shall be solely responsible for paying and providing
long-term disability benefits with respect to any Non-EU Business Employee and
any former employee of the Business who is receiving long-term disability
benefits under any plan or program as of the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold Sellers and their Affiliates harmless from any Losses arising
out of or related to obligations of Purchaser under this Section 5.4(d).

         (e) Each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the Tyco
International (US) Inc. Retirement Savings and Investment Plan (the "TII Savings
Plan") shall cease to be an active participant under such plan effective as of
the Closing Date and all account balances shall be vested. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall have, or shall cause its Affiliates to have, in
effect a defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code and that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the
meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code with terms and conditions substantially
comparable to those provided under the TII Savings Plan (the "Purchaser Savings
Plan") in which Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate. As soon
as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days, following the Closing Date,
the TII Savings Plan shall transfer to the Purchaser Savings Plan, and Purchaser
agrees to cause the Purchaser Savings Plan to accept, upon Sellers providing
sufficient information to Purchaser regarding the accounts (including promissory
notes evidencing all outstanding loans and subject to any qualified domestic
relations orders pursuant to Section 414(p) of the Code), the account balance
(which account balance shall have been credited with any earnings attributable
to the period from the Closing Date to the date of transfer, and reduced by any
benefit or withdrawal payments made in respect of such Employees during such
period) of each Transferred Employee under the TII Savings Plan as of the date
next preceding the date of transfer to the trustee designated under Purchaser's
401(K) Plan and evidence from Sellers that the TII Savings Plan is qualified
under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. Such transfer shall be subject to
Sellers' receipt of evidence satisfactory to them that the Purchaser Savings
Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, which evidence
may include a current determination letter from the IRS indicating that the
Purchaser Savings Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the
Code. Following such transfer, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, assume all Liabilities of Sellers and their Affiliates under the TII Savings
Plan to provide benefits to or on behalf of the Transferred Employees to the
extent of the account balances so transferred, and neither the TII Savings Plan
nor Sellers or their Affiliates shall have any obligation to Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or with respect to any Transferred Employee with respect thereto.

         (f) Following the Closing Date: (i) Purchaser shall ensure that no
waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with respect to any pre-existing
conditions, evidence of insurability or good health or actively-at-work
exclusions are applicable to any Transferred Employees or their dependents or
beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans, as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA, in which such Transferred Employees may be eligible to participate (other
than to the extent applicable under Benefit Plans prior to Closing); and (ii)
Purchaser shall

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred by the
Transferred Employees up to (and including) the Closing Date shall be
specifically applied for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments
or limitations on coverage under any such welfare benefit plans. Purchaser shall
be responsible under its employee welfare benefit plans for all amounts payable
by reason of claims incurred by Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries at any time after the Closing Date. Sellers shall
remain responsible for any welfare benefit claims incurred by Business Employees
prior to the Closing Date under Benefit Plans and any medical insurance benefit
claim incurred prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt "medical
insurance benefit claims" shall not include claims for workers compensation
benefits, short-term disability benefits, sick pay benefits, or supplemental pay
benefits. A claim shall be deemed incurred when the service is performed for
medical claims and when a hospital stay commences for hospitalization.

         (g) Promptly following Closing, Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser (or
cause Purchaser to be reimbursed) for its costs incurred to provide Retention
Payments in an amount equal to the product of (x) the aggregate Retention
Payments, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days elapsing between June 29, 2005 and the Closing Date (but not to exceed
547), and the denominator of which is 547. In the event that Purchaser pays to
any Transferred Employee, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date, any retention bonus amount in excess of the foregoing Retention Payments,
Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for such additional retention payments in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000.

         (h) Purchaser shall have in effect, or cause to be in effect, as of the
Closing Date, flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan
qualifying under Section 125 of the Code (the "Purchaser Cafeteria Plan") that
provides benefits to Transferred Employees substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to those provided by the flexible spending reimbursement accounts
under the cafeteria plans in which such Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate as of the date hereof (the "Tyco Cafeteria Plan"). As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause to be transferred to
Purchaser an amount in cash equal to the excess of the aggregate accumulated
contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts under the Tyco
Cafeteria Plan made during the year in which the Closing Date occurs by the
Transferred Employees over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made for such
year from such accounts to such Transferred Employees; provided, that, if the
aggregate payouts from the flexible spending reimbursement accounts made during
the year in which the Closing Date occurs to such Transferred Employees exceed
the aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts for such year by such
employees, Purchaser shall cause such excess to be transferred to Sellers as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, subject to Sellers' providing
sufficient information to Purchaser regarding the accounts and the account
balances of the participants (including a copy of each participant's election,
the dollar value of the annual election, the amounts contributed as of the
Closing and the amounts paid to the participants as of the Closing). Purchaser
shall cause such amounts to be credited to each such Transferred Employees'
corresponding accounts under the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan in which such
employees participate following the Closing Date. Subject to Sellers' complying
with the provisions of this Section 5.4(h), on and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for all claims for
reimbursement by Transferred Employees, whether incurred

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of
the Closing Date, which claims shall be paid pursuant to and under the terms of
the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers and their Affiliates from any and all claims by or with respect to
Transferred Employees for reimbursement under the Tyco Cafeteria Plan that have
not been paid in full as of the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to cause the
Purchaser Cafeteria Plan to honor and continue through the end of the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs the elections made by each Transferred
Employees under the Tyco Cafeteria Plan in respect of the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date.

         (i) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice,
including severance, vacation and paid time-off plans, policies or practices,
sponsored or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall
recognize, for all Transferred Employees from and after the Closing Date, credit
for all service with the Asset Selling Entities, the Conveyed Companies and
their respective predecessors, prior to the Closing Date for all purposes
(including eligibility to participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence
benefits, benefit accrual, early retirement subsidies and severance).

         (j) Purchaser and Sellers will cooperate to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 5.4, including informing and consulting with employee
representatives prior to the Closing Date in accordance with, and at such time
or times as shall be required under, applicable requirements of Law. Purchaser
and Sellers shall cooperate and consult with one another as necessary as to the
content of such information and consultation. In addition, Sellers and their
Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in allowing Purchaser
access to the Business Employees for interviews on a mutually convenient basis
prior to the Closing Date, as reasonably requested by Purchaser to the extent
permitted by applicable requirements of Law (including without limitation any
employee consents).

         (k) Nothing in this Section 5.4 shall confer upon any Business Employee
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, and such Business
Employees are not intended to be, and shall not be deemed to be, third-party
beneficiaries of any such provisions.

         (l) Sellers shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates
harmless from any and all joint and several "controlled group liability" under
the Code or Title IV of ERISA incurred by Purchaser as a result of the
acquisition of the Business as if such "controlled group liability" were covered
by the provisions and conditions of Section 9.1(a)(i).

            Section 5.5. EU Business Employees.

         (a) With respect to any EU Business Employees, the Parties agree that
the purchase of the Business of any EU Asset Selling Entity pursuant to this
Agreement will constitute a "relevant transfer" for the purposes of the Transfer
Regulations and, accordingly, Purchaser or any relevant Affiliate of Purchaser
shall employ each such EU Business Employee with effect from the Closing Date,
as provided in the Transfer Regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to the EU Business Employees, such transfer shall be on terms and
conditions of employment that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the terms and conditions of employment provided to the EU Business Employees
immediately prior to the

                                      -50-
<PAGE>

Closing Date and in any event not less favorable than the terms and conditions
of employment provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Affiliates. For a period of at least one (1) year following the Closing Date,
Purchaser covenants and agrees to, or to cause its Affiliates to, maintain
unchanged and continue to provide each EU Business Employee with the terms and
conditions of employment described in this Section 5.5(a).

         (b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their
Affiliates from any and all Losses incurred after the Closing Date as a result
of, arising out of, or in connection with (i) the EU Business Employees before
the Closing Date in respect of any breach of the information and consultation
provisions of the Transfer Regulations by Purchaser or any Affiliate of
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser; (ii) any claim by an EU Business
Employee (whether or not such EU Business Employee resigns and/or objects to
becoming employed by Purchaser under the Transfer Regulations) that any EU Asset
Selling Entity is in breach of contract of employment and/or in breach of any
statutory employment rights because of any change in, or any plans of Purchaser
(or any relevant Affiliate of Purchaser) to change, any terms and conditions of
employment or working conditions of any EU Business Employee after the Closing
Date and (iii) the EU Business Employees on and after the Closing Date.

         (c) If the contract of employment of any EU Business Employee is found
(or alleged) not to have effect after the Closing Date as if originally made
with Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that (i) in consultation with Sellers, it will
within seven (7) days of being informed in writing of such finding or allegation
make to the relevant EU Business Employee an offer to employ him or her under a
new contract of employment to take effect on the release and termination
referred to below, and (ii) any such offer made by Purchaser will be on terms
and conditions which taken as a whole do not differ in any material way from the
terms and conditions of employment of that EU Business Employee immediately
before the Closing Date (save as to the identity of the employer). Upon that
offer being made (or at the time the offer should have been made if no offer is
made) the relevant EU Asset Selling Entity shall release the relevant EU
Business Employee from his or her obligations, and terminate the employment of
the relevant EU Business Employee from the Closing Date until such termination
and the termination of such employment.

            Section 5.6. Certain Dividends, Etc. Notwithstanding any provision
herein to the contrary (including Section 5.2), each Conveyed Company will be
permitted, to the fullest extent allowed by Law, to distribute to Sellers or any
one (1) or more of its or Sellers' designated Affiliates, at any time prior to
the Closing, its Cash and Cash Equivalents.

            Section 5.7. Bulk Transfer Laws. Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers
have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action required to comply with
any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or similar Laws. Purchaser shall
not withhold any portion of the Gross Purchase Price based on such
non-compliance. Sellers hereby agree to indemnify Purchaser for all Liabilities
(including any Tax liabilities) resulting from non-compliance with any such
Laws, except to the extent specifically accounted and reserved for in the
calculation of Closing Date Working Capital.

            Section 5.8. Sellers' Marks. Within thirty (30) days after the
Closing, Purchaser shall cause each division of the Business and each Conveyed
Company (each, a

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

"Purchased Division") to change its name to a name that does not include "Tyco,"
"Tyco Electronics," "TEPCG," "TPCG," any of Sellers' Marks or any derivatives
thereof or anything confusingly similar thereto. Except as otherwise permitted
by this Section 5.8, Purchaser, each Affiliate thereof, the Purchased
Division(s), and their respective directors, officers, successors, assigns,
agents, or representatives shall not register, or attempt to register, and shall
not directly or indirectly use, in any fashion, including in signage, corporate
letterhead, business cards, internet websites, marketing material and the like,
or seek to register, in connection with any products or services anywhere in the
world in any medium, any Intellectual Property that includes, is identical to or
is confusingly similar to, any of the trademarks, service marks, domain names,
trade names or other indicia of origin set forth on Schedule 5.8 or any other
indicia of origin characterized as an Excluded Asset under this Agreement
(collectively, "Sellers' Marks"), nor shall any of them challenge or assist any
third party in opposing the rights of Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers
anywhere in the world in any such Intellectual Property. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall any of the Transferred Intellectual Property be deemed
to constitute Intellectual Property that includes, is identical to, or is
confusingly similar to, any of Sellers' Marks. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, except during the six (6) month period immediately following the Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Section 5.8, no right or grant is provided for
herein for Purchaser or any Purchased Division to (i) use the Sellers' Marks
alone or in combination with any other mark, name or term or (ii) grant
sublicenses to the Sellers' Marks for any purpose whatsoever. Subject to the
restrictions set forth herein, Sellers hereby grant to Purchaser effective as of
the Closing Date, a personal, nonexclusive, royalty-free license for six (6)
months after the Closing Date, (x) to use tools, dies and molds acquired by
Purchaser hereunder which carry one (1) or more of the Sellers' Marks to be
cast, struck or molded into Inventory and (y) to use the name "TPCG" solely in
connection with the domain name "TPCG.net"; provided that Purchaser shall not
advertise or otherwise publicize such use. Purchaser shall in any event phase
out such use of such tools, dies and molds as soon as is reasonably practicable,
and, in particular, shall if practicable remove the cast for such marks from
each such tool, die or mold on the first occasion after the Closing Date when
such tool, die or mold is refurbished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers
hereby grant to Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date a royalty-free
license to use Sellers' Marks and Purchaser will not be required to remove
associated branding thereof only with respect to Inventory as of the Closing
Date. Such limited license shall terminate six (6) months after the Closing Date
regardless of whether or not Inventory branded with Sellers' Marks remain in
Inventory of Purchaser or any Purchased Division. All use of Sellers' Marks as
permitted hereunder shall inure to the benefit of Sellers. Except as otherwise
permitted by this Section 5.8, Purchaser shall ensure that promptly following
the Closing Date, any hypertext links to Internet websites operated by Sellers
or their Affiliates and any other use of Sellers' Marks are removed from any
Internet web sites operated by any Purchased Division or included in the
Purchased Assets.

            Section 5.9. Post-Closing Information. For a period of three (3)
years following the Closing (or, with respect to Tax matters, until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations), upon reasonable written
request delivered to Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, such Party shall, and
such Party shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, (a) afford to the other
Party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
the properties, books and records and employees of such Party and its applicable
Affiliates with respect to the Conveyed Companies, the Purchased Assets, the
Equity Interests, and the Business to the extent necessary to prepare or defend
any judicial or administrative proceeding related to

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

the Conveyed Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Equity Interests or the
Business, or to enable such Party and its Representatives to satisfy their
financial reporting and tax planning and preparation obligations and (b)
preserve copies of such books and records. From and after the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing (or, with respect to Tax matters, the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations), neither Party shall be obligated to
preserve copies of such books and records, other than such books and records
with respect to which the other Party has requested a copy on or prior to such
third (3rd) anniversary, in which case such copies shall be provided to the
requesting Party at such requesting Party's cost.

            Section 5.10. Replacement of Parent Guarantees and Letters of
Credit.

         (a) Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with each other and
use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to terminate each of the
parent company guarantees and letters of credit listed on and described on
Schedule 5.10(a) hereto (respectively, the "Parent Guarantees" and "LOCs")
effective as of the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the beneficiary of each Parent
Guarantee and LOC, effective as of the Closing, to accept a substitute guarantee
or such other form of assurance (including a letter of credit or other cash
collateral) as may be reasonably requested by the beneficiary of each such
Parent Guarantee or LOC.

         (b) To the extent Sellers and Purchaser are unable to terminate or
replace a Parent Guarantee or LOC or obtain the beneficiary's consent to the
substitution therefor prior to the Closing as contemplated in Section 5.10(a),
Sellers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts (and to cause their
Affiliates to use their commercially reasonable efforts) to maintain each such
Parent Guarantee or LOC in place until the expiration of the then current term
of the underlying Contract or other obligation supported by each such Parent
Guarantee or LOC in accordance with its terms (it being understood that after
each such expiration, Sellers and/or their Affiliates shall have no obligation
to renew any such Parent Guarantee or LOC). Purchaser shall have a continuing
obligation after the Closing to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have
any such Parent Guarantee or LOC terminated or replaced in a manner consistent
with the last sentence of Section 5.10(a).

            Section 5.11. Post-Closing Obligations. (a) Purchaser shall not,
without the prior written consent of Sellers, enter into any amendment,
modification or waiver of any Real Property Lease that could extend the term
thereof beyond its then-current term, with respect to any Real Property Lease as
to which the landlord has not granted consent, where required, to the transfer
of such lease in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Seller (or one of its Affiliates other than the Conveyed Companies)
remains the leasing party, or a guarantor, or is otherwise secondarily liable
for the obligations of the lessee, under such lease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Real Property Lease that involves a
month-to-month tenancy and with respect to which any Seller (or any of its
Affiliates other than the Conveyed Companies) remains the leasing party, or a
guarantor or is otherwise secondarily liable, in no event shall Purchaser or its
Affiliates extend such Real Property Lease (or otherwise continue or renew such
month-to-month tenancy) later than the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date.

determine that any assets included in the Purchased Assets remain in the
physical possession of Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including any
personal property or other assets constituting Purchased Assets that are
physically located at any of the real property described on Schedule
2.3(a)(xvi)), then, within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request
from Sellers describing in reasonable detail the nature and location of such
Purchased Assets, Purchaser shall, at Purchaser's cost and expense, remove or
cause the removal of such Purchased Assets from Sellers' possession and any
premises of Sellers (during normal business hours and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with Sellers' operation of their respective businesses or
cause damage to their respective properties).

on the Closing Date and ending on the second (2nd) anniversary thereof, none of
Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates within the Tyco Electronics

Agreement plans to operate which is in competition with the Business, as
conducted on the Closing Date; provided that no Seller nor any of its Affiliates

   Act of 1934, as amended, of any Person to the extent that such acquisitions
   do not result in such Seller or any of its Affiliates owning in the aggregate
   five percent (5%) or more of any class of such securities;

               (ii) acquiring (through merger, stock purchase or sale of all or
   substantially all of the assets or otherwise) ownership of or any equity

   any business that competes with the Business are not more than twenty percent
   (20%) of such Person's total annual revenues (based on the most recent full
   fiscal year revenues of such Person; and provided, further, that if such
   annual revenues are in excess of twenty percent (20%), then such Seller or
   its Affiliate shall be permitted to acquire such competing business and such
   Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliate to enter into a definitive
   agreement to divest the competing business within twelve (12) months of the
   closing of such acquisition ; or

any time prior to two (2) years from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly,

independent contractor or otherwise) of any of the Transferred Employees without
Purchaser's prior written consent, unless the employment of such Transferred
Employee was terminated by Purchaser prior to such solicitation or (b) hire in

any of its Affiliates.

obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
payment of the Gross Purchase Price at the Closing, so long as each of the
conditions contained in Article VII are satisfied, or capable of being
satisfied, at the Closing.

                                   TAX MATTERS

            Section 6.1. Allocation of Taxes. The Parties shall, unless
prohibited by applicable Law, close the taxable period of the Conveyed Companies
as of the close of the Closing Date. Where not so permitted and with respect to
Taxes attributable to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the
Business, the portion of any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period to be allocated
to the Pre-Closing Portion of a Straddle Period shall be deemed (x) in the case
of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (without regard to net income), to
be the amount of such Taxes of the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, such as real property Taxes, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Portion of
the Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days
in the entire Straddle Period or (y) in all other cases, equal to the amount
that would be payable if the taxable period ended on and included the Closing
Date.

            Section 6.2. Responsibility for Preparation and Filing of Tax
Returns.

         (a) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, within applicable
statutory limits, all Tax Returns (including any amendments thereto) due
(including extensions) after the Closing Date with respect to (x) Tax Returns of
the Conveyed Companies and (y) Tax Returns (other than Tax Returns for Income
Taxes of the Asset Selling Entities) attributable to the ownership or operation
of the Purchased Assets or the Business for any taxable period. Purchaser shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes required by applicable Tax Law with respect
to such Tax Returns; provided that Sellers shall pay to Purchaser or its
designee, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date any such Tax is due
(taking into account valid extensions) to the applicable Taxing Authority (the
"Due Date"), the amount for which Sellers are allocated pursuant to Section 6.1
or any Tax with respect to a Pre-Closing Period with respect to the taxable
period covered by any such Tax Return. All such Tax Returns required to be filed
by Purchaser or a Conveyed Company pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) shall be
furnished by Purchaser to Sellers, for Sellers' review and approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld) at least
thirty (30) days prior to the Due Date for filing such Tax Return. Purchaser
shall revise such Tax Returns prior to filing to reflect any good faith comments
of Sellers given to Purchaser within

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

fifteen (15) days of Sellers' receipt of the draft Tax Return; provided, that in
the event that the Tax Return's Due Date is within four (4) months after the
Closing Date, then such time periods shall be reasonably reduced and the Parties
shall act expeditiously so that the Tax Return may be filed on a timely basis;
provided, further, that to the extent that Purchaser does not agree with
Sellers' comments, the Parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such
disagreement and, failing that, any such disagreement shall be resolved,
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to the procedures provided
in Section 6.11. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Sellers, which such
consent shall be at the sole discretion of Sellers, all such Tax Returns (i)
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice, (ii) shall not
include any change in any method of accounting and (iii) shall not include any
Tax election that is inconsistent with past practice.

         (b) Purchaser agrees that, to the extent it is able to do so under
applicable Law, Purchaser or any of its relevant Affiliates shall file any
amended Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period reasonably
requested by any Seller with respect to which such Seller is liable for any
Taxes pursuant to this Agreement (provided that such amended Tax Return is not
reasonably expected to cause a material adverse effect on Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates). Sellers will be responsible for any costs associated with the
preparation and filing of any amended Tax Return pursuant to this Section
6.2(b); provided that nothing in this Section 6.2(b) or in any other provision
of this Agreement shall require Purchaser or any of its relevant Affiliates to
carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit with respect to Purchased
Assets or of a Conveyed Company arising in a Post-Closing Period. Purchaser will
cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to cooperate, fully and at Sellers' expense,
with Sellers and their counsel in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall not seek to amend a Tax Return that
relates to a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period of a Conveyed Company or that
is attributable to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the
Business for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period without the prior written
consent of Sellers, which consent may be withheld in their sole discretion.

         (c) Sellers agree that, to the extent they are able to do so under
applicable Law, Sellers or any of their relevant Affiliates shall file any
amended Tax Return as reasonably requested by Purchaser relating to Taxes
described in Section 5 of the Transition Services Agreement - Employee Benefits
and Payroll Services for the period between the Closing and the Expiration Date
of such agreement (provided that such amended Tax Return is not reasonably
expected to cause a material adverse effect on Sellers or any of their
Affiliates). Purchaser will be responsible for any costs associated with the
preparation and filing of any amended Tax Return pursuant to this Section 6.2(c)
(including any costs for interest or penalties resulting from any such amended
Tax Return); provided that nothing in this Section 6.2(c) or in any other
provision of this Agreement shall require Sellers or any of their relevant
Affiliates to carry forward any item of loss, deduction or credit with respect
to Purchased Assets or of a Conveyed Company arising prior to Closing. Sellers
will cooperate, and cause their Affiliates to cooperate, fully and at
Purchaser's expense, with Purchaser and its counsel in connection therewith.

            Section 6.3. Tax Proceedings.

         (a) Each Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall provide to the other notice within at least ten (10) days of any pending
or threatened Tax

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

Proceeding as to which it receives written notice from a Taxing Authority
related to any Taxes for which it is indemnified by the other Party. Such notice
shall contain factual information (to the extent known) describing any asserted
liability for Taxes in reasonable detail and shall be accompanied by copies of
any notice and other documents it has received from any Taxing Authority in
respect of any such matters. Failure to deliver such notice in accordance with
this Section 6.3(a) will not relieve the other Party of any of its obligations
under this Agreement except to the extent such Party is materially harmed by
such failure (and then only to such extent).

         (b) The Seller to which the Tax relates shall be entitled to assume and
control (including as to settlements) Tax Proceedings (x) relating to any
Pre-Closing Period of a Conveyed Company or (y) attributable to the ownership or
operation of the Purchased Assets or the Business for any Pre-Closing Period,
and shall provide written notice to Purchaser whether it elects so to control
any such Tax Proceeding not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by such
Seller of written notice of such Tax Proceeding; provided, that in the case of
any Tax Proceeding relating to any Conveyed Company, if a Seller elects to
control such Tax Proceeding, then such Seller shall be obligated to (i) consult
with Purchaser in good faith regarding such Tax Proceeding and (ii) copy
Purchaser on all correspondence with any Governmental Authority relating to such
Tax Proceeding. A Seller may settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of any Tax
Proceeding that such Seller elects to control pursuant to this Section 6.3(b)
without the consent of Purchaser, unless such settlement, compromise or other
disposition would impose any obligation or Liability upon Purchaser for which
Purchaser is not fully indemnified hereunder, in which case such settlement,
compromise or other disposition shall require Purchaser's prior consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld).

         (c) Purchaser shall be entitled to assume and control (including as to
settlements) Tax Proceedings (i) relating to Transfer Taxes, (ii) for Straddle
Periods and Post-Closing Periods of the Conveyed Companies, (iii) attributable
to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or the Business for any
Straddle Period or Post-Closing Period (other than with respect to Income Taxes
of the Asset Selling Entities) or (iv) covered by Section 6.3(b) for which a
Seller has not provided timely written notice to Purchaser to the effect that
such Seller elects to exercise Seller's right to assume control pursuant to
Section 6.3(b); provided, that (x) Sellers shall have the right, at their own
expense, to participate fully in the conduct of such Tax Proceeding and consult
with Purchaser regarding any such Tax Proceedings; (y) Purchaser shall provide
Sellers with a timely and reasonably detailed account of each stage of such Tax
Proceeding and a copy of all documents (or portions thereof) relating to such
Tax Proceeding and (z) any settlement or other disposition of any such Tax
Proceedings described in clause (i) or (ii) above may only be made with the
consent of the appropriate Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld. Any dispute regarding the settlement or other disposition of any such
Tax Proceeding shall be resolved, consistent with clause (z) above, pursuant to
the procedures provided in Section 6.11.

            Section 6.4. Tax Indemnity.

         (a) Sellers, jointly and severally, shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and against all Losses that Purchaser
incurs arising from or out of or related to (without duplication):

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

                  (i) all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes) with respect to the
   Conveyed Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods and, with respect to any
   Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes for such Straddle Period allocated
   to the Pre-Closing Portion pursuant to Section 6.1, except in each case to
   the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital;
   provided that Sellers shall not indemnify Purchaser for such Taxes to the
   extent that such Taxes arise from or relate to a Clawback Event of any of
   Purchaser, the Conveyed Companies or any of their Affiliates;

                  (ii) any and all Liabilities for Taxes retained by Sellers
   pursuant to Section 2.5(e), except to the extent that such Taxes are
   reflected in the Closing Date Working Capital;

                  (iii) any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
   warranty of Sellers contained in Section 3.15; and

                  (iv) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Sellers
   contained in this Article VI;

provided that Sellers shall not indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates pursuant
to this Section 6.4(a) to the extent such Losses are incurred or arise out of or
are related to any action taken or failed to be taken by Purchaser, the Conveyed
Companies or their Affiliates on or after the Closing Date.

         (b) Purchaser, the Conveyed Companies and their respective Affiliates
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their
respective Affiliates from and against all Losses that Sellers or their
Affiliates incur arising from or out of or related to (without duplication):

               (i) all Taxes with respect to the Conveyed Companies for all
Post-Closing Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Taxes for such Straddle Period not allocated to the Pre-Closing Portion
pursuant to Section 6.1;

               (ii) any and all Liabilities for Taxes assumed by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.4(e);

               (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser
contained in this Article VI;

               (iv) any Transfer Taxes; and

               (v) any action taken or failed to be taken by Purchaser, the
Conveyed Companies or their Affiliates on or after the Closing Date.

         (c) As set out in Section 6.12, it is understood and agreed by the
Parties that any payments made pursuant to this Article VI are intended to be
treated for Tax purposes as adjustments to the Gross Purchase Price. However, in
the event that a reimbursement of Tax made pursuant to this Article VI is
subjected to Tax by a Taxing Authority, other than amounts recharacterized as
interest by such Taxing Authority ("Tax Detriment"), then the amount for

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

which the indemnifying Party is responsible shall be increased by an amount such
that the indemnified Party, on a net after-Tax basis, receives an amount equal
to the amount of the Tax claim; provided, that this Section 6.4(c) shall not
apply to interest paid to a Tax indemnified Party by reason of Section 6.12.

            Section 6.5. Refunds and Credits. To the extent any determination of
Tax liability of Purchaser or its Affiliates, whether as the result of an audit
or examination, a claim for refund, the filing of an amended return or
otherwise, results in any refund of Taxes (other than (x) any refunds (or
reductions in cash payments of Taxes) that were specifically accounted for in
Closing Date Working Capital or (y) any refunds for Transfer Taxes) (i) relating
to any Pre-Closing Period or any Pre-Closing Portion of a Straddle Period of the
Conveyed Companies or (ii) attributable to the ownership or operation of the
Purchased Assets or the Business for any Pre-Closing Period or any Pre-Closing
Portion of a Straddle Period ("Sellers' Refunds"), any such refund shall belong
to Sellers and Purchaser shall promptly pay any such refund, and the interest
actually received thereon, to Sellers upon receipt thereof by Purchaser. Any and
all other refunds shall belong to Purchaser. Any payments made under this
Section 6.5 shall be net of any Taxes payable with respect to such refund,
credit or interest thereon (taking into account any actual reduction in Tax
liability realized upon the payment pursuant to this Section 6.5).

            Section 6.6. Section 338 Elections. Purchaser shall have the right
to make, or to cause its Affiliates to make, elections under Section 338(g) of
the Code (each such election, a "Section 338 Election") with respect to the
purchase and sale, for U.S. federal Tax purposes, of the shares of either
Conveyed Company. Each Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other,
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, (i) treat the Section 338
Elections as valid, (ii) file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
Section 338 Elections, and (iii) take no position contrary thereto, except to
the extent required pursuant to a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)
of the Code).

            Section 6.7. Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Transfer Taxes shall be borne by Purchaser. Each of
Sellers and Purchaser (on its own behalf and with respect to the Conveyed
Companies) shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it in respect of Transfer Taxes, and shall pay
(or cause to be paid) to the applicable Taxing Authorities the Transfer Taxes
shown to be due and payable on such Tax Returns. Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns, and Purchaser shall
reimburse Sellers for any Transfer Taxes that Sellers pay pursuant to this
Section 6.7 and reasonable costs associated with preparing and filing such Tax
Returns.

            Section 6.8. Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreement or
similar arrangement between any Seller or any of their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any Conveyed Company, on the other hand, shall be terminated with
respect to the Conveyed Company prior to the Closing.

            Section 6.9. Resale or Other Exemption Certificates. At the Closing
(or within such reasonable time thereafter as may be necessary for Purchaser to
prepare the resale or other exemption certificates), Purchaser shall prepare and
execute (and use commercially

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

reasonable efforts to provide, to the extent within Purchaser's possession or
knowledge, tax identification or registration numbers and any other information,
in all cases specifically and reasonably requested by Sellers in connection
with) any resale exemption certificates or other applicable exemption
certificates for all states and localities identified by Sellers on Schedule 6.9
as jurisdictions in which Inventory is to be transferred, but only to the extent
that such exemption is available under, and such resale exemption certificates
or other applicable exemption certificates have been prepared in compliance
with, applicable Laws.

            Section 6.10. Assistance and Cooperation in Tax Matters. After the
Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to cooperate, with each other and with each other's
agents, including accounting firms and legal counsel, in connection with Tax
matters relating to the Conveyed Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Equity
Interests and the Business including (i) the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return, (ii) determining the liability for and amount of any Taxes due or the
right to and amount of any refund of Taxes, (iii) examinations of Tax Returns
and (iv) any administrative or judicial proceedings in respect of Taxes assessed
or proposed to be assessed. Such cooperation shall include making available by
Sellers and Purchaser to each other all information and documents in their
possession relating to the Conveyed Companies, the Purchased Assets, the Equity
Interests or the Business as provided in Section 5.9. Sellers and Purchaser also
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make available to the
other, as reasonably requested and available, personnel responsible for
preparing, maintaining and interpreting information and documents relevant to
Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.10 to the contrary, Sellers
shall not have to cooperate or provide Purchaser access to any information and
documents in their possession relating to Income Taxes for any Asset Selling
Entity, and, except to the extent solely relating to Taxes attributable to a
Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser shall not have to cooperate or provide Sellers
access to any information and documents in its possession relating to Income
Taxes of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than a Conveyed Company).
Sellers shall provide Purchaser copies of any Tax Returns (in the possession of
any Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller) of a Conveyed Company. Any information
or documents provided pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall be kept confidential
by the Party receiving the information or documents, except as may otherwise be
necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in connection with any
administrative or judicial proceedings relating to Taxes. Purchaser shall
reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates for its allocable share of any and all
reasonable fees, costs, or expenses paid or incurred by Sellers or their
Affiliates related to the defense of an audit or other similar proceeding with
respect to Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible under this Agreement.
Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for its allocable share of
any and all reasonable fees, costs, or expenses paid or incurred by Purchaser or
its Affiliates related to the defense of an audit or other Tax Proceeding (or
preparation of a Tax Return) with respect to Taxes for which any Seller is
responsible under this Agreement or refunds to which any Seller is entitled
hereunder. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser
shall not be required to provide any Person with any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return (or copy thereof or information with respect thereto) that
includes Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (other than providing pro forma
information relating solely to the Conveyed Companies or the Purchased Assets).

            Section 6.11. Dispute Resolution. If Sellers and Purchaser fail to
agree on the resolution of any of the matters in Section 2.9 or this Article VI
that states that the procedures

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

of this Section 6.11 shall apply, then such matter shall be referred to a law or
accounting firm (the "Arbiter") for binding arbitration. Sellers and Purchaser
shall mutually agree on an Arbiter that is unrelated to any Party to this
Agreement. In the event that Sellers and Purchaser cannot agree on an Arbiter,
Sellers and Purchaser each shall select a law or an accounting firm, and the two
(2) firms selected shall mutually select a third law or accounting firm,
unrelated to any Party to this Agreement, to act as the Arbiter. The choice of
an Arbiter by the two (2) firms pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
binding on the Parties. Within thirty (30) days of the selection of the Arbiter,
Sellers and Purchaser shall deliver to the Arbiter copies of any schedules or
documentation which may reasonably be required by the Arbiter to make its
determination. The Arbiter shall render a determination within sixty (60) days
of its selection. Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall pay to the
other Party the amount determined by the Arbiter within thirty (30) days of the
date on which the Arbiter makes its determination. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Section 6.10, the Arbiter may, at its sole discretion, amend the
procedures contained herein. The determination of the Arbiter shall be final and
binding on all parties. The costs incurred in retaining the Arbiter shall be
shared equally, fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser. In the event that a Tax Return is required to be filed under
applicable Tax Law prior to the time that the Arbiter has resolved any
disagreement relating thereto, the Party required under applicable Tax Law to
file such Tax Return shall be entitled to do so.

            Section 6.12. Payment. All amounts required to be paid to a Party
under this Article VI shall be paid in Dollars and translated from local
currency at the spot rate. If a Party (the "Payor") fails to make a payment due
and owing under this Article VI to the other Party or any of its Affiliates (the
"Payee") within thirty (30) days of the date prescribed by this Article VI (or,
if earlier, the date that the Payee paid the applicable Taxing Authority a Tax
for which the Payor was responsible), then the Payor shall pay to the Payee
interest (such interest to be calculated on the basis of a year of three hundred
sixty (360) days and the actual number of days elapsed) on such payment from and
including the date on which such payment was due, but excluding the day the
Payor makes such payment, at a rate equal to eight percent (8%) per annum. In
the event that any payment under this Article VI is subject to withholding tax,
the Payor shall withhold such Tax and pay such Tax over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority and shall pay the Payee such additional amounts as are
necessary so that the net amount received by the Payee after deduction of
withholding Tax with respect to such payment and with respect to such additional
amounts is equal to the amount that would have been received if no such
withholding had been made. Such additional amounts shall be reduced by the
amount of any Tax Benefit actually realized in cash to the Payee from the
payment of such withholding Tax.

            Section 6.13. Survival. Notwithstanding any other provision to the
contrary, the rights and obligations provided for in this Article VI shall
survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation (or such later date as may be necessary to resolve any claim as to
which notice has been given prior to such date).

            Section 6.14. Adjustment. All amounts paid, or caused to be paid, by
one Party or its Affiliates to another Party or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement (other than interest in accordance with Section 6.12) shall be treated
by the Parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Gross Purchase Price to
the extent permitted by Law.

                                      -64-
<PAGE>

            Section 6.15. Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold from the
Gross Purchase Price any amount that Purchaser is required to withhold under
applicable Tax Law or other Taxes imposed on any Seller or any of their
Affiliates, and any such withheld amount shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid hereunder. In furtherance thereof, Purchaser shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Gross Purchase Price ten percent
(10%) of the amount of the Gross Purchase Price allocable to any "United States
real property interest" within the meaning of the Code (unless documentation
from the applicable Taxing Authority (or, in the case of Code Sections 897 and
1445, from Sellers and their Affiliates) reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Purchaser is received by Purchaser at or prior to the Closing).

Affiliates incurring or suffering net Losses of more than Seventeen Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($17,500,000), (it being expressly acknowledged and
agreed by the Parties that such amount shall not be deemed a proxy or standard
for determining whether a "Material Adverse Effect" has occurred for any purpose
of this Agreement), and each Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser a
certificate of a duly authorized officer of such Seller, dated the Closing Date,
to such effect.

            Section 7.2. Performance of Agreements. Sellers shall have

            Section 9.1. Indemnification by Sellers.

         (a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this
Article IX and except as set forth in Article VI which shall govern with respect
to the matters expressly set forth therein, Sellers shall jointly and severally
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates from and
against any and all Losses to the extent arising or resulting from (i) any
Retained Liability, (ii) any breach by any Seller of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) the failure of any representation
or warranty made by a Seller in this Agreement to be true and correct on the
Closing Date with the same effect as though such representations and warranties
had been made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent such
representations and warranties expressly relate to a date prior to the Closing
Date (in which

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of
such earlier date), in each such case disregarding all qualifications and
exceptions contained therein relating to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
words of similar import, (iv) any Loss from Environmental Conditions not
referenced in or evident from the information included on Schedule 3.10,
including any costs for investigation, assessment, monitoring, testing,
excavation, clean-up, treatment and disposal costs and the expenses, costs and
fees of consultants, attorneys, contractors, laboratories, drillers, haulers and
disposal facilities, provided that any claim for such Loss (A) is made in
accordance with this Article IX, (B) is made prior to the earlier of (x) the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) with respect to any claim
for indemnification in respect of a Loss relating to a particular parcel of Real
Property, the date on which Purchaser shall have transferred or disposed of such
Real Property to any Person that is not an Affiliate of Purchaser or agreed to
indemnify or otherwise be liable to any such Person in respect of any
Environmental Condition relating to such Real Property, (C) is due to
requirements of a Governmental Order and (D) is not related to a change in use
of any Real Property which results in a use different from the use of the Real
Property on the Closing Date. Any payment made to Purchaser by Sellers pursuant
to the indemnification obligations under this Section 9.1(a) shall constitute a
reduction in the Aggregate Purchase Price hereunder. Sellers obligations
pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section 9.1(a) shall expire upon the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date.

         (b) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers shall not have any
liability under any provision of this Agreement for any Loss to the extent that
such Loss relates to actions taken by Purchaser or any other Person (other than
Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries in breach of this Agreement) after the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss for which Purchaser is
reasonably likely to seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a).

            Section 9.2. Indemnification by Purchaser.

         (a) From and after the Closing, subject to the provisions of this
Article IX and except as set forth in Article VI which shall govern with respect
to the matters expressly set forth therein, Purchaser shall defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates from and against any and all
Losses to the extent arising or resulting from (i) any Assumed Liability or any
Liability of a Conveyed Company, (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, (iii) the failure of any
representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement to be true and
correct on the Closing Date with the same effect as though such representations
and warranties had been made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent
such representations and warranties expressly relate to a date prior to the
Closing Date (in which case such representations and warranties shall be true
and correct on and as of such earlier date), in each such case disregarding all
qualifications and exceptions contained therein relating to materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or words of similar import, (iv) the assignment and
transfer to Purchaser of any material Non-Assignable Contract to the extent that
any requisite consent or approval with respect thereto shall not have been given
prior to the Closing, (v) events occurring on or after the Closing Date in
connection with the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Equity Interests
including the use, ownership, possession, operation or occupancy of any Leased
Real Property or Real Property, the Intellectual Property of the Business, the
Purchased Assets or the Equity Interests from and after the Closing Date, or
(vi) any Parent Guarantee or LOC that remains outstanding after the Closing.

                                      -68-
<PAGE>

         (b) Sellers shall take and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss for which a Seller
is reasonably likely to seek indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a).

                  Section 9.3. Indemnification Procedure.

         (a) Except as set forth in Article VI, promptly after the incurrence of
any Losses by any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.1 or
9.2 (an "Indemnified Party"), including any claim by a third party described in
Section 9.4, which could reasonably be expected to give rise to indemnification
hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Party from which
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") a certificate (the
"Certificate"), which Certificate shall:

                  (i) state that the Indemnified Party has incurred or
   anticipates it will incur Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled
   to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

                  (ii) specify in reasonable detail the basis for any
   anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of
   warranty, breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and
   a good faith estimate of the amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to
   be entitled hereunder; provided that the failure to provide a Certificate in
   accordance with this Section 9.3(a) shall not affect the obligations of an
   Indemnifying Party unless it is actually materially prejudiced thereby,
   subject, however, to the time limits specified in Section 9.5.

         (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification request of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or
claims specified in any Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such
Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice of objection to such
effect, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection, and the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the sixty (60) day
period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
objection, attempt to agree upon a resolution of such claims to which the
Indemnifying Party shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall succeed in reaching agreement on a resolution of any of
such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall promptly
prepare and sign a settlement agreement setting forth such resolution. Should
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any
particular claim or claims or amount or amounts within such time period, then
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall submit such dispute to a
court of competent jurisdiction as set forth in Section 11.10.

         (c) Claims for Losses specified in any Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within forty-five (45) days of
receipt of such Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a settlement agreement
of the nature described in Section 9.3(b), and claims for Losses the validity
and amount of which have been the subject of judicial determination as described
in Section 9.3(b), or shall have been settled with the consent of the
Indemnifying Party as described in Section 9.4, are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as "Agreed Claims." Within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any

                                      -69-
<PAGE>

Agreed Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party an
amount equal to the Agreed Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to the bank account or accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice
to the Indemnifying Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such
payment.

            Section 9.4. Third-Party Claims.

         (a) Except as set forth in Article VI, if a claim by a third party is
made against any Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnification hereunder for any Loss under this Article IX,
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such claim; provided that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect
the obligations of the Indemnifying Party unless it is actually materially
prejudiced thereby, subject, however, to the time limits specified in Section
9.5. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, by
notice to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days' of the
Indemnifying Party's receipt of notice of the third party claim, to conduct and
control, through counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) of
its choosing, such third party claim (a "Third-Party Claim"), and the
Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle the same; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified Party advance notice of any
proposed compromise or settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall not
compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
participate in, but not control, the defense of any such action or suit through
counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party; provided, that the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. So long as the
Indemnifying Party has agreed to undertake, conduct and control the settlement
or defense of any Third Party Claim and is contesting such claim in good faith,
no Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim for which it
is seeking indemnification hereunder without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against a
Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as
provided above or otherwise, then (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend against such Third Party Claim and the portion of any Third Party
Claim as to which the defense by the Indemnified Party is unsuccessful (and the
reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such defense) shall be a liability
of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to participate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party
Claim.

         (b) The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the defense or
prosecution of any Third-Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the
retention and the provision of any records and information of the Indemnifying
Party that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and (ii) the
making available of employees on a mutually convenient and commercially
reasonable basis for providing additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

            Section 9.5. Survival Periods.

         (a) All representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement (with the exception of the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.6(b)

                                      -70-
<PAGE>

and 3.6(c) which, as provided in such Section, shall automatically expire upon
delivery of the Audited Financial Statements) or any certificate or instrument
delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing for a period of
thirteen (13) months immediately following the Closing Date, except that: (i)
the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.10 ("Environmental
Matters") shall survive the Closing until the third (3rd) anniversary thereof,
(ii) the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.15 ("Taxes")
shall survive the Closing until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and (iii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.2 ("Corporate Authority; Binding Effect"), Section 3.3(b)
("Conveyed Companies; Capital Structure"), and Section 3.19 ("Title to Assets")
shall survive forever. The Closing shall not in and of itself constitute a
waiver by any Party of any rights it may have with respect to any obligations of
the other Parties. In the event that an Indemnified Party provides written
notice in accordance with Section 9.3 or Section 9.4 to the Indemnifying Party
within the applicable period of time set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 9.5(a), and such claim shall not have been finally resolved before the
expiration of the applicable period referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 9.5(a), any representation or warranty that is the basis for such claim
shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity only as to such
specific claim (but as to no other claim) until such claim is finally resolved.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no period of time within which
notice of or a claim for indemnity against a Seller must be provided by
Purchaser with respect to those items set forth in Sections 9.1(a)(i) or (ii) or
a claim for indemnity against Purchaser must be provided by a Seller with
respect to those items set forth in Sections 9.2(a)(i) or (ii).

         (b) This Section 9.5 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the
Parties contained in this Agreement which by its terms contemplates performance
after the Closing, and shall not extend the applicability of any covenant or
agreement of the Parties contained in this Agreement which by its terms solely
relates to the period between the date hereof and the Closing.

            Section 9.6. Limitation of Liability.

         (a) In no event shall (i) Sellers be liable for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iii) (except if in connection with any breach of the
representations and warranties in Section 3.25) for any claim unless and until
the aggregate of all such claims result in total Losses which are incurred or
suffered by Purchaser that exceed Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($3,750,000) (the "Deductible"), in which case Purchaser shall be
entitled to indemnification for only such Losses that are in excess of the
Deductible; provided, that neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall have any
right to indemnification with respect to any individual Loss that is less than
Sixty-Five Thousand Dollars ($65,000), and no such Loss shall be taken into
account in determining whether, or to what extent, the Deductible has been met
or exceeded; (ii) the aggregate liability of Sellers pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(iii) (except if in connection with any breach of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.19 and Section 3.25) exceed an aggregate amount of
Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) (the "Cap"), (iii) Sellers be liable
for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iv) for any individual Loss in an
amount less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (such amount, the
"Environmental Deductible"), in which case Purchaser shall be entitled to
indemnification only for the amount of such Loss in excess of the Environmental
Deductible, (iv) Sellers be liable for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(iv) in an amount that, together with all other Losses for which

                                      -71-
<PAGE>

Purchaser is entitled to indemnification hereunder, is greater than the Cap or
(v) the aggregate liability of Sellers pursuant to Sections 9.1(a) exceed the
Aggregate Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible shall be
disregarded (and Sellers shall therefore be liable for all Losses, subject to
the Cap) for all Losses to the extent resulting or arising from any breach, as
of the date hereof, of any Article III representation or warranty that is
disclosed subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Closing.

         (b) In no event shall (i) Purchaser be liable for indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iii) for any claim unless and until the aggregate of
all such claims result in total Losses which are incurred or suffered by Sellers
that exceed the Deductible, in which case Sellers shall be entitled to
indemnification for only such Losses that are in excess of the Deductible, (ii)
the aggregate liability of Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iii) exceed the
Cap, and (iii) the aggregate liability of Purchaser pursuant to Sections
9.2(a)(ii) exceed the Aggregate Purchase Price.

         (c) Any indemnification due by any Indemnifying Party shall be limited
to the actual amount of Losses sustained by the Indemnified Party,
notwithstanding the fact that the Indemnifying Party's obligation may result
from a set of facts constituting more than one (1) breach of a warranty,
representation or covenant hereunder.

            Section 9.7. Losses Net of Insurance, Etc. The amount of any Loss
for which indemnification is provided under Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 6.4 shall be
net of (i) any accruals or reserves for such Loss included in the determination
of the Closing Date Working Capital, (ii) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party for such Loss from any third party, and (iii) any insurance
proceeds or other cash receipts or sources of reimbursement received by the
Indemnified Party as an offset against such Loss (each source described in
clauses (ii) and (iii), a "Collateral Source") and (iv) an amount equal to the
present value of the Tax Benefit, if any, attributable to such Loss.
Indemnification under this Article IX shall not be available unless the
Indemnified Party first uses commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery
from all Collateral Sources. The Indemnifying Party may require an Indemnified
Party to assign the rights to seek recovery pursuant to the preceding sentence;
provided, that the Indemnifying Party will then be responsible for pursuing such
claim at its own expense. If the amount to be netted hereunder in connection
with a Collateral Source from any payment required under Sections 9.1 or 9.2 is
determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise
required to be paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such
determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay
pursuant to this Article IX had such determination been made at the time of such
payment, and any excess recovery from a Collateral Source shall be applied to
reduce any future payments to be made by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
Section 9.1 or 9.2.

            Section 9.8. Other Limitations. Purchaser shall not be entitled to
indemnification with respect to a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of Sellers contained in Article III if and to the extent that any of
Kenton Alder, Steve Richards, Shane Whiteside, Jeanette Newman, Guilda Javaheri
or Clay Swain (i) had actual knowledge prior to the date hereof of the events or
conditions constituting or resulting in such breach of such representation or
warranty, and (ii) could reasonably be expected to have ascertained that Losses
would result from such events or conditions.

<PAGE>

            Section 9.9. Sole Remedy/Waiver. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that, in the event the Closing occurs, the remedies provided for in this
Agreement shall be the Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any breaches of
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement (other than in the
event of fraud). Each Party hereto further acknowledges and agrees that its
obligations to fulfill the covenants, undertakings and agreements set forth in
this Agreement applicable to it are unique and that any breach or threatened
breach of any of its obligations under any such covenants, undertakings and
agreements may result in irreparable harm and substantial damages to the other
Party. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by any Party
of any covenant, undertaking or agreement set forth in this Agreement, the other
Party shall have the right, in addition to exercising any other remedies at law
or in equity which may be available to it under this Agreement or otherwise, to
obtain injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies in
any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the breach, and/or to prevent
the continuance of any breach, of any such covenant, undertaking or agreement,
together with an award or judgment for any and all damages, losses, liabilities,
expenses and costs incurred by the non-breaching party as a result of such
breach or threatened breach. Each Party expressly waives any requirement based
on any statute, rule or procedure, or other source, that any other Party post a
bond as a condition of obtaining any of the above-described remedies.

                                   TERMINATION

            Section 10.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

         (a) by written agreement of Purchaser and Sellers;

         (b) by either Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other
hand, by giving written notice of such termination to the other Party, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to November 3, 2006 (the "Drop Dead
Date"); provided, that neither Sellers, on the one hand, nor Purchaser, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(b) if the failure to consummate the Closing by the Drop Dead Date
shall be due to the failure of such Party(ies) to have fulfilled any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

         (c) by either Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other
hand, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental
Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such Governmental Order or other action shall
have become final and nonappealable;

         (d) by Purchaser if any of the representations or warranties of Sellers
contained in this Agreement are inaccurate or untrue to the extent that any such
inaccuracy or untruth would cause the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 7.1 or if Sellers have failed to discharge and fulfill any of their
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to the

                                      -73-
<PAGE>

extent that any such failure would cause the failure of the condition set forth
in Section 7.2, and such inaccuracy or failure has not been cured within thirty
(30) days after written notice of such failure, inaccuracy or untruth has been
given to Sellers; provided that, in the event of any dispute between the Parties
as to whether Purchaser is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(d), unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, such termination shall
not be effective until so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction before
which Purchaser shall sustain the burden of proof of such entitlement; or

         (e) by Sellers if any of the representations or warranties of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement are inaccurate or untrue to the extent that any such
inaccuracy or untruth would cause the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 8.1 or if Purchaser has failed to discharge and fulfill any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to the extent that any such
failure would cause the failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.2, and
such inaccuracy or failure has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
written notice of such failure, inaccuracy or untruth has been given to
Purchaser; provided that, in the event of any dispute between the Parties as to
whether Sellers are entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(e), unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, such termination shall
not be effective until so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction before
which Sellers shall sustain the burden of proof of such entitlement.

            Section 10.2. Effect of Termination.

         (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 10.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become void and have no
effect, and no Party shall have any Liability to the other Party or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers or employees, except for the
obligations of the Parties contained in this Section 10.2 and in Section 5.1
("Information and Documents"), Section 11.1 ("Notices"), Section 11.6 ("Public
Disclosure"), Section 11.7 ("Return of Information"), Section 11.8 ("Expenses")
and Section 11.10 ("Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial"), and
except that nothing herein will relieve any Party from Liability for fraud or
any intentional breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination.

         (b) In the event this Agreement shall be terminated and at such time
any Party is in material breach of or material default under any term or
provision hereof, such termination shall be without prejudice to, and shall not
affect, any and all rights to damages that the other Party(ies) may have
hereunder or otherwise under applicable Law.

                                   ARTICLE XI

Agreement which will remain in full force and effect for the term provided for

any written agreement among the Parties that expressly provides that it is not

confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Sellers, or their successors or
permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement;
provided, that any Affiliates of Sellers that have provided Parent Guarantees
shall be third-party beneficiaries of the obligations of Purchaser set forth in
Section 5.10.

            Section 11.6. Public Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each of Purchaser and Sellers agree that, except as may be
required to comply with the requirements of any applicable Laws and the rules
and regulations of each stock exchange upon which the securities of such Party
is listed, if any, no press release or similar public announcement or
communication shall be made concerning the execution or performance of this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party(ies).

            Section 11.7. Return of Information. If for any reason whatsoever
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, Purchaser
shall promptly return to Sellers all books and records furnished by Sellers, any
Conveyed Company or any of their respective Affiliates, agents, employees, or
representatives (including all copies, summaries and abstracts, if any, thereof)
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

            Section 11.8. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the Party
incurring such expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall bear all
fees and expenses of Grant Thornton LLP in connection with obtaining the consent
referred to in clause (ii) of Section 7.8.

            Section 11.9. Schedules.

         (a) Disclosure of a specific item in any one Schedule shall be deemed
restricted only to the Section to which such disclosure specifically relates,
except where (i) there is an explicit cross-reference to another Schedule or its
applicability to another Section is readily apparent, and (ii) Purchaser could
reasonably be expected to ascertain the scope of the modification to such other
Section. The disclosure of any matter on a Schedule shall expressly not be
deemed to constitute an admission by Sellers or Purchaser, or to otherwise
imply, that any such matter is material for purposes of this Agreement.

         (b) If on any date at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, any of the information in any Schedule is found to be not true,
accurate and complete in all material respects on and as of such date, Sellers
shall be entitled, by written notice to Purchaser, to amend the Schedules to
make such additions to or modifications of such Schedules as are necessary to
make the information set forth therein true, accurate and complete in all
material respects, and such Schedules shall thereupon be deemed amended to
reflect such additions and modifications, and the truth and accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement shall be
determined by reference to such revised Schedules, for purposes of Section 7.1;
provided, that for purposes of Section 9.1(a)(iii), any such revisions to a
Schedule subsequent to the date hereof shall be disregarded (and the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this
Agreement shall be determined without reference to such revised Schedules).
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any such revisions to a
Schedule subsequent to the date hereof shall not be disregarded (and the truth
and accuracy of the representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this
Agreement shall be determined with reference to such revised Schedules) to the
extent that such additional disclosures relate to actions or omissions of
Sellers occurring after the date hereof that are required or permitted by (as
opposed to not prohibited by) the provisions of Section 5.2 or are otherwise
taken with the prior consent of Purchaser.

            Section 11.10. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

         (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles of such State.

         (b) With respect to any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement (each, a "Proceeding"), each Party irrevocably (i) agrees and consents
to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Delaware or in the United States District Court for the State of Delaware and
(ii) waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue
of any Proceeding brought in any such court, waives any claim that such
Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the
right to object, with respect to such Proceeding, that such court does not have
any jurisdiction over such Party. The foregoing consent to jurisdiction shall
not constitute general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware
for any purpose except as provided above and shall not be deemed to confer
rights on any Person other than the respective Parties to this Agreement. Each
of Sellers and Purchaser irrevocably agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by United States registered mail to such Party's
address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action,
suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters for which it has
submitted to jurisdiction pursuant to this Section 11.10(b).

         (c) EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLERS HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR DISPUTES RELATING HERETO. EACH OF PURCHASER AND SELLERS (I) CERTIFY
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD

                                      -77-
<PAGE>

NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION 11.10(c).

         (d) The Parties agree that the prevailing Party or Parties, as the case
may be, in any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be
entitled to reimbursement of all costs of litigation, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, from the non-prevailing Party. For purposes of this Section
11.10(d), each of the "prevailing party" and the "non-prevailing party" in any
suit, action or proceeding shall be the party designated as such by the court or
other appropriate official presiding over such suit, action or proceeding, such
determination to be made as a part of the judgment rendered thereby. Absent such
determination, each Party shall bear its own expenses in any such suit or
proceeding.

            Section 11.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
(1) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of
which shall constitute one (1) and the same agreement and shall become effective
when one (1) or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not
sign the same counterpart.

            Section 11.12. Headings. The heading references herein and the table
of contents hereto are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the
provisions hereof.

            Section 11.13. No Strict Construction. The Parties have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event any
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as if drafted jointly by all Parties, and no presumption or burden
of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

            Section 11.14. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall
be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.
If any term or other provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to
any Person or any circumstance, is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (a) a
suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry
out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such
invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and
the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, nor shall such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability
of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.
