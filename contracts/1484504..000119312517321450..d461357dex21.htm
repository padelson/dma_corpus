of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that at
the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "Gigamon Inc."

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.11_, at the Effective Time,
and without any further action on the part of the Company and Merger Sub, the
Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

Merger and without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company,
or any other Person, each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate or book entry evidencing

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without

is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Shares of
Restricted Stock, it being understood and hereby agreed that all cash payments
that become payable in respect of Restricted Stock pursuant to this _Section
1.4(b)_ shall be unrestricted and paid promptly upon compliance with

effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that nothing in this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. With respect to any Shares

applicable thereto will be based on actual performance as set forth in the
applicable agreements

and each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if any, to be paid in
respect thereof pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_, without interest. The
Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Shares in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a certificate representing
Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, then, subject
to the provisions set forth in _Section 2.3_, such certificate shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 1.4(b)_, _provided_ , _however_ , that if any certificates
representing Shares or Uncertificated Shares shall not have been exchanged
prior to two (2) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the related Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(ii) _Cancelled Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company, or any other Person,
each Share that is owned by Newco, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Newco, Merger Sub or the Company, in
each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cancelled Shares_ "),
shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or
consideration paid therefor.

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares being referred to collectively as
the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware
Law with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised value of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal
has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(i)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The
Company shall provide Newco prompt written notice of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the

such demand, and Newco shall have the opportunity and right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Newco, the Company shall not
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

with the Merger. At the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall,
without any action on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive,
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the excess,
if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share
of such Company Option, multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares
issuable upon the exercise in full of such Company Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ "); _provided_ that, if the exercise price per share of any
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment or other
consideration being made in respect thereof.

(ii) _Restricted Stock Units; Performance Restricted Stock Units_. Newco
shall not assume any Restricted Stock Units in connection with the Merger. At
the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall, without any action
on the part of Newco, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (x) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (y) the total number of Shares subject to such
award of Restricted Stock Units (the " _Restricted Stock Unit Consideration_
"). With respect to any Performance Restricted Stock Units, the achievement
of all performance goals applicable thereto will be based on actual
performance as set forth in the applicable agreements governing the
Performance Restricted Stock Units, any earned portion of such award will be
eligible to vest based on the terms set forth in such agreements, and any
unearned portion of such award shall be cancelled without any cash payment or
other consideration being made in respect thereof.

the Company ESPP shall automatically be exercised, in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP, prior to the Effective Time (the " _Final Purchase_
"), (ii) the Company ESPP shall terminate with the Final Purchase and
no further purchase rights are granted under the Company ESPP thereafter, and
(iii) each individual participating in the Company ESPP or eligible to
participate therein shall not be permitted (x) to increase the amount of his
or her rate of payroll contributions thereunder from the rate in effect on
the date of this Agreement or commence new contributions, or (y) to make
separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the
date of this Agreement. All shares of Company Common Stock purchased in the
Final Purchase shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

 



-5- (e) _Implementation_. The Company Board or a committee thereof shall pass
resolutions to effect the transactions contemplated by _Sections 1.4(b)(i)_,
_1.4(c)_ and _1.4(d)_ under the Company Equity Incentive Plans, Company ESPP,

the Closing, Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option
Consideration and Restricted Stock Unit Consideration, in each case, less any
applicable withholding Taxes, required to be paid to the holders of such
Company Options and Restricted Stock Units, as applicable. The cancellation of
the Company Options or Restricted Stock Units as provided in this _Section
1.4(c)_ shall be deemed the termination, and satisfaction in full of, any and
all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of such Company Options
or Restricted Stock Units.

 

1.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes or intent of this

possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Company and
Merger Sub shall have the authority to take all such lawful and necessary
action.

Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent for all purposes only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of _Article I_. If Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article I_

shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver
a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with

a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such

amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that such

applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

1.4(b)(iii)_ shall be returned to Newco, upon demand; _provided_ that the
parties acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Newco shall not be required under this _Section 2.3_ or otherwise
to deposit with the Payment Agent any cash to pay Merger Consideration with
respect to Shares as to which its holder has purported to deliver a notice or
demand of appraisal that has not been withdrawn prior to the Closing Date.

believe that any term or condition to the Financing set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters will not be fully satisfied on a timely basis or that the
Financing will not be available to Newco at the Closing, including any reason
to believe that any of the Debt Financing Sources or the Guarantors will not
perform their respective funding obligations under the Financing Commitment
Letters in accordance with their respective terms and conditions.

will (i) prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as
amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Company
Stockholder Meeting and (ii) set a preliminary record date for the Company
Stockholder Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to

commercially reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof. Subject to _Section
7.1(c)_, the Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement.

 

(ii) If the Company determines it is required to file any document other than
the Proxy Statement with the SEC in connection with the Merger pursuant to
Applicable Law (such document, as amended or supplemented, an " _Other
Required Company Filing_ "), then the Company shall promptly prepare and file
such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of
the SEC and NYSE. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing with the SEC without providing Newco and its counsel,
to the extent practicable, a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon, which comments shall be considered by the Company in good faith. On
the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if
applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the
Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to any information supplied by Newco, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Newco
Filings will not, at the time that such Other Required Newco Filing is filed
with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

 

(iii) If Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is/are
required to file any document with the SEC in connection with the Merger or
the Company Stockholder Meeting pursuant to Applicable Law (an " _Other
Required Newco Filing_ "), then Newco and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, promptly prepare and file such Other
Required Newco Filing with the SEC. Newco and Merger Sub shall cause, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to cause, any Other Required Newco
Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Neither Newco or Merger Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates may file
any Other Required Newco Filing (or any amendment thereto) with the SEC
without providing the Company and its counsel, to the extent practicable, a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, which comments shall be
considered by Newco, Merger Sub or their Affiliates in good faith. On the date
of filing, the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if
applicable), and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other
Required Newco Filing will knowingly contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Newco or Merger Sub with
respect to

 



-44-  any information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by
Newco, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required
Company Filing will not, at the time that the Proxy Statement or such Other
Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, knowingly contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

(iv) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall furnish all information concerning it and its Affiliates,
if applicable, as the other party may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement and any Other
Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing. If at any time
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Newco, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates should be
discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Newco or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco
Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then the party
that discovers such information will promptly notify the other, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing such
information will be prepared and filed as promptly as practicable with the SEC
by the appropriate party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the
SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

(v) The Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in
writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing, as the case
may be, without providing the other, to the extent practicable, a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such written communication which comments
shall be considered by the filing party in good faith.

 

(vi) The Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of
any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (A) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Newco Filing, as the case may be, (B) any receipt of
comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other Required
Company Filing or any Other Required Newco Filing, as the case may be, or (C)
any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in
connection therewith.

(vii) Subject to Applicable Law, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the filing
thereof with the SEC.

 



-45- (b) _Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(i) The Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the " _Company
Stockholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this
Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and, if applicable, the advisory
vote required by Rule 14a(21)(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith (and such Company Stockholders Meeting shall in any event be no
later than 45 calendar days after (A) the 10th calendar day after
the preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC if by
such date the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review the
Proxy Statement or (B) if the SEC has, by the 10th calendar day after the
preliminary Proxy Statement therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed
the Company that it intends to review the Proxy Statement, the date on which
the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement). The
Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting solely (A)
with the consent of Newco, (B) if there are not holders of a sufficient number
of Shares present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting
to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (C) if the Company
is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by
Applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff, or (D) if the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate
to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give the
Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise
made available to the Company Stockholders (including in connection with any
Company Board Recommendation Change).

 

(ii) The Company shall solicit from Company Stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, and unless
the Company Board has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless this
Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, the Company
shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law, whether or not the Company
Board at any time subsequent to the date hereof shall have effected a Company
Board Recommendation Change or otherwise shall determine that this Agreement
is no longer advisable or recommends that the Company Stockholders reject it.

(c) _Board Recommendation_.

 

(i) Except in the case of a Company Board Recommendation Change specifically
permitted by this _Section 7.1(c)_, (A) the Company Board shall (x)
recommend that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Delaware Law (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (y) include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and (B) neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (1) fail to make, withdraw,
amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner that is adverse
to Newco, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the
Company Board

 



-46-  Recommendation in a manner that is adverse to Newco, (2) approve, endorse,
adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction other than the
Merger (the actions or inactions referred to in the preceding clauses (1) and
(2) being referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to clause (v) below, the Company Board may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval in the event that:

(1) the Company Board has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited in violation of
_Section 6.3(a)_;

 

(2) The Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (which determination and any public
announcement thereof shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change);

 

(3) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
Board shall have given Newco at least four (4) Business Days notice of its
intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ (the " _Board Recommendation Notice Period_ "), which
notice shall include the most current version of the proposed definitive
agreement and any other relevant transaction documents and, to the extent not
included therein, all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal;

 

(4) if requested by Newco, during the Board Recommendation Notice Period, the
Company shall meet and negotiate with Newco in good faith regarding
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Superior Proposal ceases to be a Superior Proposal;

 

(5) prior to the end of the Board Recommendation Notice Period, Newco shall
not have made a counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a manner that, if
accepted by the Company, would form a binding contract, that the Company Board
determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel) is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as
such Superior Proposal (it being understood that (x) any material revision to
the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, shall
require a new notice pursuant to clause (3) above, (y) the Board
Recommendation Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to the extent
necessary to ensure that at least two (2) Business Days remain in the Board
Recommendation Notice Period subsequent to each time the Company notifies
Newco of any such material revision and (z) there may be multiple extensions
of the Board Recommendation Notice Period); and

(6) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal made by Newco

 



-47-  pursuant to clause (5) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change is inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change for an
Intervening Event unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal at any time prior to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the event that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to effect such a Company Board Recommendation
Change is inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, taking into account all
adjustments that may be offered by Newco pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may not make a
Company Board Recommendation Change under this clause (iii) for an Intervening
Event unless (A) the Company provides Newco with written information
describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail promptly after it
becomes aware of it, (B) the Company notifies Newco in writing at least four
(4) Business Days before making an Company Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the
reasons therefor and (C) if Newco makes an offer or proposal capable of being
accepted by the Company as a binding agreement during such four (4) Business
Day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of
this Agreement as offered or proposed by Newco, determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to make
such Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.
During the four (4) Business Day period prior to its effecting a Company Board
Recommendation Change for an Intervening Event, the Company shall, and shall
cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Newco in good faith
(to the extent Newco seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement offered or proposed by
Newco.

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule
14d-9 under the Exchange Act or any other Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_
, that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d9-f under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
a Company Board Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly
reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys stockholders in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure and expressly
rejects any applicable Acquisition Proposal.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including
clause (ii) above), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other Contract, in each case related to,
or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Transaction (except an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms (including the payment of the Company Termination
Payment pursuant to  _Section 8.4_).

 



-48- 7.2 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) _Filings and Cooperation_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in any case within 10 Business
Days with respect to the HSR Act), each of Newco and the Company shall file
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Merger) as required by the HSR Act. Each of Newco and
the Company shall (a) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of
such filings, (b) supply the other with any information that may be required
in order to effectuate such filings, and (c) supply any additional
information that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ
or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and

shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be,
of any communication from any Governmental Authority in the U.S. regarding the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party
hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such
party shall use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

 

(b) _Remedies_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Newco or any of its Affiliates be required to
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any
and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest,
assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of
Newco and Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the
one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (B) any
other restrictions on the activities of Newco and Merger Sub (and their
respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

 

7.3 _Financing_.

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Newco and Merger Sub will not permit any
assignment of the Financing Commitment Letters, or any amendment or
modification (including an amendment or modification effected by way of a
side letter) (it being agreed that any Alternate Debt Financing shall not be
deemed to be an amendment or modification) to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing Commitment Letters if such
amendment, modification or waiver would, or could reasonably be expected to,
(i) reduce (other than pursuant to the "flex" provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter) the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (unless the
Equity Financing is increased by an equivalent amount) or reduce the aggregate
amount of the Equity Financing such that they aggregate an amount below the
Required Amount (after giving effect to other available sources of
cash), (ii) adversely impact the ability of any of Newco, Merger Sub or the
Company, as applicable, to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto,
(iii) impose new or additional conditions to the Financing, or

 



-49-  otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing in a manner that would, or could reasonably be expected to,
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Financing when
required pursuant to the terms hereof or (iv) prevent, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Financing when required pursuant to the terms
hereof; _provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, without the consent of
the Company, each of Newco and Merger Sub may (x) correct typographical
errors, (y) provide for the assignment of a portion of the commitments or
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter to additional agents, arrangers,
lenders, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities or reallocate
commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between or among, any
entities party thereto (including replacement of a lender) or (z) modify
pricing and implement or exercise any of the "flex" provisions contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(b) _Equity Financing_. Newco shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Equity Financing, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Equity
Commitment Letter, (ii) complying with its obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Newco or Merger Sub in such Equity Commitment Letter that are
within its control, if any, and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of
the Equity Commitment Letter and _Section 9.11_, (x) enforcing its rights
under the Equity Commitment Letter, including through the initiation of legal
proceedings against the Guarantors if and to the extent necessary to obtain
the Equity Financing contemplated thereby, and (y) consummating the Equity
Financing at or prior to Closing, including by causing the Guarantors to fund
the Equity Financing at the Closing. Newco shall not permit, without the prior
written consent of the Company, any amendment or modification to be made to,
or any termination, rescission or withdrawal of, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter. Any breach by Newco
of its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter shall be deemed to be a
breach by Newco of this _Section 7.3(b)_.

(c) _Debt Financing and Alternate Debt Financing_. Newco shall use (or cause
Merger Sub to use) its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and obtain the financing contemplated thereby as promptly as reasonably
practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter, which shall consist of, without limitation, (i) maintaining in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof (except as otherwise permitted hereunder), (ii)
negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions no less favorable to Newco or Merger Sub (in the reasonable
judgement of Newco) that those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
(iii) timely preparing any necessary offering circulars, private placement
memoranda, or other offering documents or marketing materials with respect to
the Debt Financing, (iv) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to
funding within their respective control that are applicable to Newco and
Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, (v)
commencing any marketing and syndication activities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, and (vi) if all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter
are satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied on Closing) and the conditions in _Sections 2.2(a)_ and
_2.2(b)_ of this Agreement have been satisfied, consummating the Debt
Financing at or prior to the Closing. Newco and Merger Sub will fully pay, or
cause to be fully paid, all commitment or

 



-50-  other fees arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they
become due. For the avoidance of doubt, the "reasonable best efforts" of Newco
and Merger Sub pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(c)_ includes an obligation on
the part of Newco and Merger Sub to enforce their rights pursuant to the
Financing Commitment Letters, including the initiation of an appropriate Legal
Proceeding against any Debt Financing Source under the Debt Commitment
Letters pursuant to which each of Newco and Merger Sub will use its reasonable
best efforts to compel such Debt Financing Source to provide its portion of
the Debt Financing in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letters if the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters have been
satisfied and one or more of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letters fails to provide its respective portion of the Debt
Financing and, as a result, the Closing does not occur or would reasonably be
expected not to occur. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
in the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any
"flex" provisions provided in the fee letter) (other than by reason of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company or any Affiliate) and such portion is
reasonably necessary to fund the Required Amount, then Newco shall, to the
extent not in violation of this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, use
its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from alternative
sources on terms, conditions and costs not materially less favorable in the
aggregate to Newco, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation (in the
reasonable judgment of Newco) than those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter ( _provided_ that such terms, conditions and costs would not have any
of the effects specified in _Section 7.3(a)_) and in an amount sufficient to
pay the Required Amount (taking into account other available sources of cash)
(the " _Alternate Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain one or more new
financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate Debt Financing
(the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New Debt Commitment
Letters will replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part.
Newco shall promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt
Commitment Letters (and any fee letter in connection therewith, which may be
delivered with the fee amounts, pricing caps, "flex" terms and other economic
and numerical terms redacted in a customary manner). In the event that any New
Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment Letter" will be
deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by
one or more New Debt Commitment Letters at the time in question and any New
Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to
the foregoing.

 

(d) _Information_. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Newco shall (i)
inform the Company on a current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing or any applicable Alternate Debt Financing, and (ii) provide the
Company with copies of all executed amendments, modifications or replacements
of the Debt Commitment Letter (it being understood that any amendments,
modifications or replacements shall only be as permitted herein) or principal
definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Newco and Merger Sub shall promptly notify the
Company (A) of any breach, default, termination or cancellation of which
Newco becomes aware by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing to the extent such breach,
default, termination or cancellation would reasonably be expected to
materially

 



-51-  delay or prevent the Closing, (B) of the receipt by Newco or Merger Sub of
any written notice or communication from the Guarantors, or any Debt Financing
Source with respect to any termination or cancellation of any Financing
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements.

(e) _No Financing Condition_. Newco and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. In the event
that the Financing has not been obtained, Newco and Merger Sub will each
continue to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.2_, to consummate the Merger.

(f) _Company Support_.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to use its respective
reasonable best efforts, to provide Newco and the Debt Financing Sources, at
Newcos sole expense, with all cooperation reasonably requested by Newco to
assist it in causing the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter to
be satisfied or as is otherwise reasonably requested by Newco in connection
with the Debt Financing, including:

(1) participating (and causing senior management of the Company to
participate) in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-
one meetings between the Debt Financing Sources and members of senior
management), presentations and due diligence sessions;

 

(2) (A) taking all corporate and other actions reasonably requested by Newco
to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and (B) executing and
delivering, and facilitating the execution and delivery of, customary
definitive financing documentation, including any pledge and security
documents and other definitive financing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Newco or the Debt Financing Sources, and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting of security interests
in respect of the Debt Financing, it being understood that any corporate
actions or such documents will not take effect until the Effective Time;

(3) furnishing Newco and the Debt Financing Sources, as promptly as
practicable, with the financial information specified in _Section 6(x)_ of
Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter, and such other pertinent information
as Newco and the Debt Financing Sources shall request to prepare a bank
information memorandum as contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(collectively, the " _Required Financing Information_ "); _provided_ , that
the Required Financing Information will not include, or be deemed to require
the Company to prepare, any (1) financial information concerning the Company
or its Subsidiaries that the Company does not compile, prepare or otherwise
generate in the ordinary course of business, except to the extent required to
prepare a customary bank information memorandum, (2) other information not
reasonably available to the Company and its Subsidiaries under its current
internal control and reporting systems, except to the extent required to

statements and projections, including pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into
any pro forma financial information, or (4) consolidating and other financial

Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, or any Compensation, Discussion and
Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K and information regarding
executive compensation and related party disclosure related to SEC Release
Noes. 33-8732A, 34-54302A and IC-27444A, and other customary exceptions;

necessary in connection with the Debt Financing;

by the Debt Commitment Letter to be terminated;

(6) promptly, and no later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing,
furnishing Newco and the Debt Financing Sources with all documentation and
other information related solely to the Company and its Subsidiaries required
by regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations; _provided_ , that the request for
such information has been made at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
Closing.

 

(7) assisting Newco and the Debt Financing Sources (including furnishing
information to be included therein) with the timely preparation of customary
(A) rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, lender

Financing and (B) offering documents, prospectuses, memoranda and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, which documents may
include the Company logo consistent with customary practices;

(8) solely with respect to financial information and data derived from the
Companys historical books and records, providing Newco with such information
to assist in the preparation of the pro forma financial statements identified
in Section 6 of Exhibit D of the Debt Commitment Letter and other pro forma
financial information and pro forma financial statements to the extent

Agreement that could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to
such officer or Representative, 

 



-54-  or (B) the members of the Company Board as of the date hereof to approve the
Financing or any alternative financing or Contracts related thereto.

 

(g) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Newco and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose such
information to any financing sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties to
the Debt Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their
respective counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound
by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto, or (ii) are subject to
other customary confidentiality undertakings. The Company agrees and
acknowledges that the obligations of Elliott Management Corporation and any
Affiliate thereof under _Section 5_ of the Confidentiality Agreement shall

the Company hereunder or in the case of fraud). 

(i) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such
logos are used (i) solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) solely in connection
with a description of the Company, its business, and products or the Merger;
and (iii) in a manner consistent with the other customary terms and conditions

-55- 7.4 _Efforts to Close_.

 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, including the limitations contained in _Sections
7.2_ and _7.3_ , each of Newco, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do
(or cause to be done), and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably
practicable, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the
Merger set forth in _Section 2.2_ to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain
all necessary consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities, the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act and (iii) seek all necessary or appropriate
consents, waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to maintain and preserve the benefits
under such Material Contracts following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger). The Company further agrees to the
covenants set forth in _Section 7.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) _Forbearance_. In addition to the foregoing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, neither Newco or Merger Sub (or any of their
respective Affiliates), on the one hand, nor the Company (or any of its
Affiliates), on the other hand, will take any action, or fail to take any
action, that is intended to or has (or would reasonably be expected to have)
the effect of preventing, impairing, materially delaying or otherwise
adversely affecting (i) the consummation of the Merger, or (ii) the ability of
such party to fully perform its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, no action by the Company taken in compliance with
_Section 7.3(f)_ will be considered a violation of this _Section 7.4_.

 

(c) _Third Party Consents_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this _Section 7.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, with respect to
consents relating to any Contracts, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to agree to the payment of a consent fee,
"profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including increased or
accelerated payments), or the provision of additional security (including a
guaranty), to concede or agree to concede anything of value, or to amend,
supplement or otherwise modify any Contract to which it is a party or
commence, defend or participate in any Legal Proceeding.

7.5 _Access to the Company_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford Newco and its Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and after reasonable advance notice, to all
assets, properties, books and records and personnel of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Newco may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any Applicable
Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information would
give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such

 



-56-  documents or information; (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a
default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; or (d) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between
the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Newco and its
Affiliates, on the other hand; _provided_ , that, in the case of clauses (a)
through (c) above, the parties will cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain necessary consents and/or waivers from third parties
for such activities or otherwise find a way to allow diligence of such
information in a manner that would not contravene such law or cause such
waiver of a legal privilege. During such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Newco: (x) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and (y) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Newco or Merger Sub may reasonably request
(including Tax Returns filed and those in preparation and the work papers of
its auditors). Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 7.5_ will be conducted in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction
to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to
the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not
include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Newco
or any of its Representatives in connection with any investigation conducted
pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section 7.5_. All requests for
access pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ must be directed to the General Counsel
of the Company, or another person designated in writing by the Company.

 

7.6 _Notice of Breach_.

 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly notify Newco in the event that any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or in the event that the
Company has failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant or obligation to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in each case that if and only to the extent that such untruth or
inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Newco and Merger Sub contained in _Sections
2.2(b)(i),_ _2.2(b)(ii)_ or  _2.2(b)(iv)_ to fail to be satisfied.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, Newco shall promptly notify the Company in the event that any
representation or warranty made by Newco or Merger Sub in this Agreement has
become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or in the event that
Newco or Merger Sub has failed to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant or obligation to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to cause

 



-57-  any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company contained in
_Sections 2.2(c)(i)_ and _2.2(c)(ii)_ to fail to be satisfied.

 

7.7 _Confidentiality_. Newco, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Elliott Management Corporation and the Company have previously executed
a Confidentiality Agreement, dated July 13, 2017 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms (except as provided in  _Section 7.3(g)_
above).

7.8 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning this Agreement
and the Merger will be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Newco. Thereafter, the Company (unless the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has made a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one
hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties to this Agreement
before providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to
become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company,
Newco and Merger Sub will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with
respect to communications that are (i) required by Applicable Law or any
stock exchange rule or listing agreement or (ii) materially consistent in
substance with previously public communications regarding which the parties
has previously consulted.

 

7.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
promptly notify Newco of all Legal Proceedings commenced or threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including its
officers and directors), in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ") (including by providing
copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Newco
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall (a)
give Newco the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Newco with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. For purposes of this  _Section 7.9_, " _participate_ " means
that Newco will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant
decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel
is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Newco may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation. The Company shall not
enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby without Newcos prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Notwithstanding the above, the Company shall not need Newcos
consent to settle any Transaction Litigation to the extent such Transaction
Litigation is settled (1) solely for the payment of monies which
are recoverable from insurance policies available to the Company (other than
any deductibles or retention amounts applicable thereto) and (2) includes a
full and unconditional release of all liabilities arising out of such claim or
action against the Newco Parties.

7.10 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and

 



-58-  any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is or will be subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

7.11 _Directors and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Existing Agreements and Protections_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time to the extent disclosed on _Section 7.11(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other
similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be repealed,
amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by Applicable
Law.

(b) _Insurance_.

 

(i) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys
current directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (a
correct and complete copy of which has been heretofore made available to
Newco), covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms with
respect to the coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO
Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under
this _Section 7.11(b)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum
Annual Premium_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that that if the annual premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to
the Effective Time and after reasonable consultation with Newco, the Company
may, and at the request of Newco it shall, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company purchases such a
"tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)

 



-59-  maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor
their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of
the Surviving Corporation (and Newco) under _Section 7.11(b)(i)_ for so long
as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c)  _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Newco) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Newco) set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

(d) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (and their heirs and
representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Person (and their heirs and representatives). Each of the
Indemnified Persons (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 7.11_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and
their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.11_ shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons
may have under the certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at
law or in equity).

(e) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of
their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being understood
and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.11_ is
not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgment of Change of Control_. Newco hereby acknowledges that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

(b) _Existing Agreements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any such Employee Plans, arrangements
or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise required
by Applicable Law.

(c) _Continuation of Company Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Newco shall cause the Surviving Corporation to)
continue to employ the

 



-60-  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are employed as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) either (i) maintain for the benefit
of each Continuing Employee the Employee Plans and any other employee benefit
plans or other compensation and severance arrangements of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Company Plans_ " but
excluding equity based benefits, benefits related to a change in control,
retention benefits and individual employment agreements) at benefit levels
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided as of the
date of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each
Continuing Employee under such Company Plans, or (ii) provide base salary and
annual cash bonus or commission opportunities that, taken as a whole, are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary, annual cash bonus and
commission opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Comparable Plans_ "), or (iii) provide some
combination of (i) and (ii) above such that each Continuing Employee receives
compensation, benefits and severance payments (other than equity based
benefits, benefits-related to a change in control, retention benefits and
individual employment agreements) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the compensation, benefits and severance
payments (other than equity based benefits, benefits related to a change in
control, retention benefits and individual employment agreements) provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In each
case, target annual cash compensation shall not be decreased for a period of
one (1) year following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee
employed for that period. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Newco will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) provide severance benefits to eligible employees in
accordance with the Companys severance plans, guidelines and practices as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and that have been disclosed in _Section
7.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) _Service Credit; Etc_. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Newco shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide each Continuing Employee with
credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their
respective predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement) to the extent provided under the comparable
Employee Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be credited
to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans)
(such plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under
any such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Plan in which
such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees

 



-61-  participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts
of such Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending
plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under
the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused
by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and
shall not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not
limit future which shall be subject to the applicable vacation paid time-off
policy as in effect thereafter from time-to-time.

 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this  _Section 7.12_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii)
require Newco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement (including the
Employee Plans and the Company Plans).

 

7.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Newco shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Newco and Merger Sub will be jointly
and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and
discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement. During the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not
engage in any activity of any nature except for activities related to or in
furtherance of the Merger.

 

7.14 _Newco Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Newco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving
the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 

(i) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically,
that immediate and irreparable harm would likewise occur if any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, were
not consummated and the Company Stockholders did not receive the aggregate
consideration payable to them in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement), and that money damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly,
the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that, subject to _Section
9.11(b)(ii)_ below, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Company, on the one hand, and Newco and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches
of this Agreement by the other party (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other party
under this Agreement, and this right shall include the right of the Company to
cause Newco and Merger Sub to fully enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter against the Guarantor to the fullest extent permissible under the
Equity Commitment Letter and Applicable law.

(ii) Newco and Merger Sub hereby agree not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches of this Agreement by Newco or Merger Sub, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of

 



-72-  this Agreement to prevent breaches, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of Newco and Merger Sub under this Agreement. Any
party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. The parties hereto
further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this  _Section
9.11(b)_, a party hereto shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement,
the Financing Commitment Letters or the Limited Guarantee (including monetary
damages) in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.11(b)_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this  _Section
9.11(b)_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section 9.11(b)_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to
this _Section 9.11(b)_ or anything set forth in this  _Section 9.11(b)_
restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement or the Limited Guarantee that may be available then or thereafter.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters under the terms thereof, none of the Company or any of
its Affiliates or its and their direct and indirect stockholders shall have
any rights or claims (whether in contract tort or otherwise) against any Debt
Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or
arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause Newco and Merger Sub to draw down
the Equity Financing or to consummate the Merger only if:

(1) all conditions in _Sections 2.2(a)_ and _2.2(b)_  (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been
satisfied or waived;
