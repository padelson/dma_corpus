avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the aggregate amount paid by Buyer under

Section 2.9 _Assumption of Contracts_.

 

(a) Sellers shall (1) assume and assign to Buyer and (2) cause the Acquired
Subsidiaries which are Debtors (" _Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries_ ") to
assume, as applicable, the Closing Assumed Contracts at the Closing pursuant
to the Confirmation Order, subject to Section 2.11 and the other provisions of
this Section 2.9. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all Cure Costs in
connection with the assumption of the Closing Assumed Contracts shall be paid
in the Ordinary Course by the applicable Seller or Debtor Acquired Subsidiary
prior to the Adjustment Time. To the extent not paid prior to the Closing,
all Cure Costs constitute Assumed Liabilities.

(b) The Confirmation Order shall provide for (1) the assumption by the
applicable Seller party thereto and the assignment to Buyer, and (2) the
assumption by the applicable Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries, as applicable, of
each Closing Assumed Contract pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code
on the terms and conditions set forth in the remainder of this Section 2.9.

(c) At the Closing, (1) Sellers shall assume and assign to Buyer, and (2)
Sellers shall cause the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries to assume, as applicable,
the Closing Assumed Contracts, in each case, pursuant to section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code and the Confirmation Order, subject to provision by the Buyer
of adequate assurance as may be required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

 

(d) From time to time following the Execution Date (and not later than five
(5) Business Days prior to the deadline for filing a plan supplement with
respect to the Plan (or such later date as may be approved by the Bankruptcy
Court) (the " _Designation Deadline_ ")), Buyer may, in its sole discretion,
designate as an assumed contract any additional Contract (including leases)
that Buyer wishes for Sellers or the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries to assume in
connection with the Transaction (" _Additional Assumed Contracts_ ") by
providing written notice 

 



7

    

 to Sellers in the form of a schedule setting forth any such Contracts that
it wishes for the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries to assume as an Additional
Assumed Contract (an " _Additional Assumed Contracts Schedule_ ").

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if Buyer has not provided Sellers an
updated Additional Assumed Contracts Schedule to cause Sellers or the Debtor
Acquired Subsidiaries to assume any additional Contracts (that are not
otherwise Acquired Contracts or Acquired Leases) in accordance with the
foregoing, then the Contracts listed on Annex J shall be deemed to be
Rejected Debtor Contracts and Excluded Assets, and may be rejected by the
relevant Seller, with respect to any Rejected Debtor Contract pursuant to
which any Seller is a party, and shall be rejected by the Debtor Acquired
Subsidiaries, with respect to any Rejected Debtor Contract pursuant to which
any Debtor Acquired Subsidiary is a party, (y) no prepetition Cure Cost shall
be due or payable with respect to any executory contract or unexpired lease
until the permanent assumption thereof and (z) each Contract that becomes an
Additional Assumed Contract pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall concurrently be
deemed to have become an Acquired Asset.

 

(f) If, from time to time following the Execution Date and prior to the
Designation Deadline, Buyer provides written notice to the Sellers of its
desire to designate an Acquired Contract or Acquired Lease (at such applicable
time) to which Sellers or any Debtor Acquired Subsidiary is a party (including
any Additional Assumed Contract) as a Rejected Debtor Contract (a "
_Subsequent Rejection Notice_ "), such Contract shall be deemed to be a
Rejected Debtor Contract and shall no longer be an Acquired Contract or
Acquired Lease, as applicable. If Sellers or any Debtor Acquired
Subsidiary reasonably incurred any direct, incremental and out-of-pocket
administrative expenses allowed pursuant to section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy
Code associated with its continuance of such Acquired Contract or Acquired
Lease during the period between the Execution Date and the date Buyer
delivered notice to reject such previously designated Acquired Contract or
Acquired Lease, Buyer shall, within forty five (45) calendar days following
the Closing Date, reimburse the Sellers for such incremental expenses other
than expenses caused as a result of any Sellers or Acquired Subsidiarys
breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease (such reimbursable
expenses, the " _503(b) Expenses_ ").

(g) At Buyers reasonable request, and at Buyers sole cost and expense,
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer to, or to cause the Debtor
Acquired Subsidiaries to, enter into an amendment of any Closing Assumed
Contract effective upon assumption of such Closing Assumed Contract by Buyer
or the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries, as applicable (and Sellers shall, and
shall cause the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
Buyer to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer in negotiations with the
counterparties thereof); _provided that_ (i) in no event shall any such
amendments be effective prior to the Closing and (ii) Sellers shall not be
required to, or to cause the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries to, enter into any
such amendment if such amendment would result in the incurrence of any
incremental Liability by Sellers that is not otherwise paid or assumed by
Buyer at the time of the assumption by Sellers or the Debtor Acquired
Subsidiaries, as applicable, of such Closing Assumed Contract.

 

(h) Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
one or more orders of the Bankruptcy Court (which may include the
Confirmation Order), which order(s) shall reflect the terms and conditions set
forth herein, to permit Sellers and the Debtor Acquired Subsidiaries to assume
the Closing Assumed Contracts on the terms set forth in this Section 2.9.

Section 2.10 _Non-Assignability of Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale,
assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery (as applicable) or
attempted sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery (as
applicable) to Buyer of any asset that would be an Acquired Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom (in
each case excluding capital stock and solely with respect to direct interests
in such asset, claim, right or benefit, and not any such asset, claim, right
or benefit acquired indirectly through the acquisition of capital stock, and
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (a) the Acquired Equity or (b) any
asset, claim, right or benefit held by any of the Acquired Subsidiaries or
any entity in which any Acquired Subsidiary directly or indirectly holds
capital stock or equity interests, is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any governmental or third party authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents
or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, unless the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code permits and/or the Confirmation
Order authorizes the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery (as applicable) of such asset irrespective of the consent or lack
thereof of a third party, then (i) subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article VII and the transfer of the Acquired Equity,
free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than transfer restrictions of
general application imposed by securities Laws), at the Closing, the Closing
shall proceed without the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of such asset, (ii) subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court
that may be required, the Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts, and
the Parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other, to obtain
promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and (iii)
subject to any approval of the Bankruptcy Court that may be required, pending
such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the Parties shall cooperate
with each other and enter into reasonable and lawful arrangements to provide
to Buyer the benefits (including any indemnities) and burdens of the use of
such asset that Buyer would have obtained had the asset been sold, assigned,
subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered (as applicable) to Buyer at the
Closing. If the authorization, approval, consent or waiver for the sale,
assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any asset not sold,
assigned, subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing as
contemplated under this Section 2.10 is obtained following the Closing, then
Sellers shall or shall cause their respective relevant Affiliates to promptly,
sell, assign, transfer, convey, sublease and deliver (as applicable)
such asset to Buyer at no additional cost or obligation.

Section 2.11 _Affiliate Acquisitions_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer may, subject to Seller
Parents consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
elect to have any or all of the Acquired Assets conveyed or transferred to, or
any of the Assumed Liabilities assumed by, one or more of its Affiliates so
long as no such election results in any greater cost or obligation (including,
but not limited to, as a result of any withholding Tax) than Sellers or their
respective Affiliates would otherwise have had; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(i) no such election shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations to Sellers
or their respective Affiliates hereunder with respect to the Assumed
Liabilities or otherwise and (ii) subject to clause (i), the Parties hereby
agree that Buyer shall be permitted without the consent of Seller Parent to
elect to have any or all of the Acquired Assets conveyed or transferred to, or
any of the Assumed Liabilities (other than Liabilities of the Acquired
Subsidiaries) assumed by, Buyer Assignee and/or newly formed Luxembourg and/or

 



9

    

 Delaware entities, in each case, which are formed for the purpose of
effecting the Transaction and are wholly owned Subsidiaries of Buyer so long
as such transfer or assumption does not result in application of any
withholding Tax. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among those Acquired
Assets to be conveyed to Buyer and those Acquired Assets to be conveyed to the
respective Affiliates of Buyer, but in no event shall the amount of
the Purchase Price or any other items to be paid for the Acquired Assets, the
nature of the Assumed Liabilities to be assumed, the obligation to pay Taxes
or Transfer Taxes or the allocation of risk and responsibility between Sellers
and Buyer be modified to the detriment of Sellers and their respective
Affiliates as a result of the delivery of separate bills of sale, assignments
and other closing documents.

 

Section 2.12 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The Purchase Price (and other Liabilities taken into account for purposes
of Section 1060 of the Code) shall be allocated among (i) the Acquired Assets
(excluding the Acquired Shares), (ii) the U.S. Equity and (iii) the Non-U.S.
Shares, in accordance with Section 2.5(a) and otherwise as contemplated in the
statement attached hereto as Annex G (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ").

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.13, Buyer shall deliver to Seller Parent
a draft statement (the " _Asset_ ___Allocation Statement_ ") allocating (i)
the Acquired Assets Purchase Price and the portion of other Liabilities taken
into account for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code allocated to the
Acquired Assets (excluding the Acquired Shares) among the Acquired Assets
(excluding the Acquired Shares) and (ii) the U.S. Purchase Price and the
portion of other Liabilities taken into account for purposes of Section 1060
of the Code allocated to the U.S. Equity among the assets of U.S. TopCo (and
the assets of any entity disregarded as separate from U.S. TopCo for U.S. tax
purposes), in each case, in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule,
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law, as
appropriate), as of the Closing Date. If Seller Parent disagrees with the
allocations on the draft Asset Allocation Statement, Seller Parent shall
provide a notice of such disagreement to Buyer with fifteen (15) calendar
days following the delivery of the draft Allocation Statement in accordance
with the immediately prior sentence; provided, that if Seller Parent does not
so disagree, the Asset Allocation Statement delivered by Buyer shall be final
and binding. Seller Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to agree
upon the final Asset Allocation Statement within fifteen (15) calendar days
following any notice of disagreement by Seller Parent in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, and to the extent that the Seller Parent and
Buyer cannot resolve such disagreements regarding the Asset Allocation
Statement within such fifteen (15) calendar day period, such disagreements
shall be submitted to an Independent Accountant to be resolved in accordance
with procedures similar to those set forth in Section 2.13(c), mutatis
mutandis.

 

(c) Buyer and Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refunds)
in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule and Asset Allocation
Statement, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or foreign law).

 



10

    

Section 2.13 _Post-Closing_ _Adjustment_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller Parent a statement, in substantially
the form attached hereto as Annex H and signed by an executive officer of
Buyer, setting forth its calculation of the Purchase Price (including the
individual components thereof) (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ "). The Post-
Closing Statement shall be (i) prepared in good faith in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and (B) accompanied by reasonable supporting
information used by Buyer in the preparation of the estimates of each
component of the Post-Closing Statement and by a reasonably detailed
computation in substantially the form of the relevant section of Annex H.

 

(b) In the event that Seller Parent determines that the Post-Closing
Statement is incorrect or has not been prepared in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, Seller Parent shall, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day
following the date on which the Post-Closing Statement is delivered, so inform
Buyer in writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") providing Buyer with such detail
as to the objection and the specific disputed items and amounts (the "
_Disputed Items_ ") as is reasonable in light of the information provided by
Buyer in the Post-Closing Statement. During the thirty (30) day period
following delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, Sellers and their
Representatives shall have the right, upon reasonable notice to Buyer, to
reasonable access during normal business hours to the information, underlying
documentation (including work papers (subject to entering into customary
access letters if requested), schedules, memoranda and other documents), books
and records of the Acquired Subsidiaries or any financial and operating data
and other information used in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement.
The Post-Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller Parent shall be
conclusive and binding on all parties unless Seller Parent, prior to the
thirtieth (30th) day following receipt of the Post-Closing Statement, delivers
a Dispute Notice to Buyer. Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with all
other items, amounts and calculations contained in the Post-Closing Statement
other than the Disputed Items.

(c) If a Dispute Notice is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.13(b),
Sellers and Buyer shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such delivery,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed
Items. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Rule 408 of the U.S.
Federal Rules of Evidence and any comparable rule in any applicable state or
other jurisdiction shall apply to the discussions and communications among
Buyer, Sellers and their respective Representatives during such fifteen (15)
day review period. If during such period, Sellers and Buyer are unable to
reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause Deloitte LLP (other
than personnel that have conducted audit services for the Sellers) or such
other independent accounting firm of recognized international standing as may
be mutually selected by Buyer and Sellers (the " _Independent Accountant_ "),
to review this Agreement and the unresolved Disputed Items (it being
understood that in making such calculations, the Independent Accountant shall
be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator). Each Party agrees to
execute, if requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement
letter. Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with the Independent
Accountant, including by responding to written questions provided to both
Parties, and shall promptly provide all documents and information (including
work papers (subject to entering into customary access letters if requested)
of its accountants) used in preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and the
Seller Estimate, respectively, or as may be otherwise reasonably requested by

 



11

    

 the Independent Accountant. In making such calculations, the Independent
Accountant shall consider only (i) a single written submission (which
submission shall be limited to the unresolved Disputed Items) submitted by
each of Buyer and Sellers to the Independent Accountant within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the engagement thereof (a copy of which, upon receipt of
both submissions, the Independent Accountant shall forward to Buyer and
Sellers, as applicable) and (ii) written responses submitted to the
Independent Accountant within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of each
such presentation (copies of which, upon receipt of both submissions, the
Independent Accountant shall forward to Buyer and Sellers, as applicable).
Buyer and Sellers shall not engage in any other _ex parte_ communications with
the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountants determination on each
unresolved Disputed Item shall not be greater than the greater value for such
item claimed by either Sellers or Buyer in the Dispute Notice or Post-Closing
Statement, respectively, or less than the lower value for such item claimed by
either Sellers or Buyer in the Dispute Notice or Post-Closing Statement,
respectively. Sellers and Buyer shall direct the Independent Accountant to
deliver to Sellers and Buyer, as promptly as practicable (but in any case no
later than thirty (30) days from the date of its engagement), a report
setting forth such calculations. Such report shall be final and binding upon
Sellers and Buyer (absent manifest error, in which case such report shall be
returned to the Independent Accountant for correction), and neither Buyer nor
Sellers shall seek further recourse to courts or other tribunals, other than
to enforce such report. The Independent Accountant will determine the
allocation of the cost of its review and report based on the inverse of
the percentage its determination (before such allocation) bears to the total
amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to Independent
Accountant. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount to one
thousand Dollars ($1,000) and the Independent Accountant awards six hundred
Dollars ($600) in favor of Sellers position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs
of its review would be borne by Buyer and forty percent (40%) of the costs
would be borne by Sellers.

 

(d) If the Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price (the
amount in which the Closing Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price on an absolute value basis, the " _Positive Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount_ "), Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent or its designee an amount in cash
equal to the lesser of (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) the Positive
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, and Buyer and Seller Parent shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to make a payment in an amount equal to the
Adjustment Escrow Amount to Seller Parent or its designee.

(e) If the Closing Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price
(the amount in which the Closing Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price on an absolute value basis, the " _Negative Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount_ "), Buyer shall be entitled to receive a payment in cash
out of the Adjustment Escrow Amount in an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) the Negative Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount, and Buyer and Seller Parent shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
make a payment to Buyer out of the Adjustment Escrow Account in an amount
equal to the lesser of clauses (i) and (ii) of this sentence.

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) any Negative Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount shall be satisfied solely and exclusively out of the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, and no Seller shall have any obligation or liability
to Buyer for any Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount that is in excess
of the Adjustment Escrow Amount and (ii) Buyer

 



12

    

 shall not have any obligation or liability to Sellers in respect of a
Positive Purchase Price Adjustment Amount in excess of an amount equal to the
Adjustment Escrow Amount. If the Adjustment Escrow Amount is greater than the
Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, then Buyer and Seller Parent shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to make a payment to Seller Parent or its
designee in the amount remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account following
payment of the Negative Purchase Price Adjustment Amount.

(g) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.13(d), Section 2.13(e) or Section
2.13(f) shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of the
date that (i) Buyer and Sellers agree upon the Closing Purchase Price or (ii)
a dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 2.13(c). All payments under this
Section 2.13 shall be without interest.

 

(h) Any post-Closing purchase price adjustments as set forth in this
Section 2.13 shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all
Tax purposes.

Section 2.14 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, Buyer, its Affiliates and the Acquired Subsidiaries shall each be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the Buyer
or its Affiliates determines that any applicable Law requires any deduction or
withholding from any such payments (other than in respect of amounts treated
as compensation or in respect of backup withholding), the Buyer or such
Affiliate, as applicable, shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
provide notice to the Person entitled to receive the payment no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of such payment (except that, if
withholding is required by reason of change of Law within ten (10) Business
Days of such payment, then reasonably promptly following such change in Law)
and shall reasonably cooperate with such Person in securing any available
reduction or exemption from such deduction or withholding. Amounts so withheld
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the applicable Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.15 _Asset Sale Election_. At any time prior to the date that is the
sixty (60) days after the Execution Date, Buyer may deliver written notice to
Seller Parent (the " _Asset Sale Election_ ") that Buyer wishes for the
Transaction to provide for the sale of assets and assumption of Liabilities
of U.S. TopCo to Buyer instead of the sale and purchase of the U.S. Equity by
Buyer from the U.S. Share Seller as contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers
agree to cooperate in good faith with Buyer including by making any
amendments to this Agreement that are not adverse to Sellers in order to
implement the foregoing (it being understood that the transfer of employment
of Employees to an existing or newly formed Acquired Subsidiary in connection
with the Asset Sale Election will not be adverse).

Section 2.16 _Permitted Plan Distributions_. The Acquired Subsidiaries may
make Permitted Plan Distributions in connection with the Closing, unless such
Permitted Plan Distributions would result in (i) the amount of Closing Date
Cash falling below fifty million Dollars ($50,000,000) with respect to
amounts held in the Peoples Republic of China; (ii) the amount of Closing
Date Cash falling below ten million Dollars ($10,000,000) with respect to
amounts held in South Korea; or (iii) Closing Date Cash falling below (A) one
hundred twenty 

 



13

    

 million Dollars ($120,000,000) _minus_ (B) the amount of Closing Date Cash
held in Brazil or India. Any Cash of the Acquired Subsidiaries paid in respect
of Permitted Plan Distributions shall be excluded from the calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price and Purchase Price (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the definition of Closing Date Cash), and any Leakage associated with
any transfers of Cash in connection with such Permitted Plan Distributions
shall be included in Closing Date Indebtedness.

_ARTICLE III _

Section 3.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) All material Benefit Plans are listed on Section 3.10(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule which specifies whether such Benefit Plan is (i) a U.S.
Benefit Plan or a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan and (ii) a Seller Plan or an Acquired
Subsidiary Plan.

 

(b) Each Seller has provided or made available to Buyer true and complete
copies of all material written Benefit Plans and all amendments thereto and,
as applicable: (i) the current prospectus or summary plan description for any
such Benefit Plan and any summaries of material modifications to such current
prospectus or summary plan description; (ii) the most recent favorable
determination, advisory or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
for such

 



20

    

 U.S. Benefit Plans; (iii) the most recent annual return/report (Form 5500)
and accompanying schedules and attachments thereto for such U.S. Benefit
Plans; (iv) the most recently prepared actuarial reports and financial
statements for such U.S. Benefit Plans; and (v) all material correspondence
related thereto since the Spin-Off Date with any Government Entity.

 

(c) All Benefit Plans have been maintained in material compliance with
their terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA, the Code and the

manner to avoid any material penalty taxes thereunder. Each Benefit Plan which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or has
applied to the Internal Revenue Service for such favorable determination or
opinion letter, and to the Knowledge of Sellers, there are no circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. Each Benefit Plan, and any award agreement thereunder,
that is, or is intended to be part of a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated and
administered in accordance with all applicable requirements of Section 409A of
the Code in all material respects. Neither Seller Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Benefit Plan
covered by Subtitle B, Part 4 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
Execution Date, would be reasonably likely to subject Sellers or any Acquired
Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount that would be material. No Controlled
Group Liability has been incurred by any Seller, Acquired Subsidiary, or
their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and no
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result in any Seller,
Acquired Subsidiary, or their respective ERISA Affiliates incurring any such
liability in an amount that would be material, including under any
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. "
_Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and all liabilities (1) under Title
IV of ERISA, (2) under Section 302 of ERISA and (3) under Sections 412 and
4971 of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means
with respect to any entity all other entities (whether or not incorporated)
that would be treated together with the first entity as a "single employer"
within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code.

 

(d) As of the Execution Date, except as would not be material, (i) all
contributions, premiums and payments that are due pursuant to the terms of
any Benefit Plan have been made for each Benefit Plan within the time periods
prescribed by the terms of such plan or applicable Law, and (ii) all
contributions, premiums and payments for any period ending on or before the
Execution Date that are not due are properly accrued to the extent required to
be accrued under applicable accounting principles.

 

(e) No Litigation, including any proceedings by any Government Entity, are
pending, or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened with respect to any
Benefit Plan, except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

(f) Neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
Transaction (either alone or together with any other event) will (i) entitle
any current or former Employees, Directors or Independent Contractor to any
payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance pay or benefits
or any increase in the amount of any bonus, severance pay or

 



21

    

 benefits payable or provided under any Benefit Plan (other than severance
pay required by any Law), (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
materially increase the amount of compensation payable to any current or
former Employees under any Benefit Plan or to any Directors or Independent
Contractors, or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under any Benefit Plan or to any
Directors or Independent Contractors, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of
Sellers or, after the Closing, Buyer, to merge, amend or terminate any of the
Benefit Plans.

 

(g) No Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary has any material obligation
to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Employee,
Director or Independent Contractor for any Tax incurred by such Employee,
Director or Independent Contractor.

 

(h) No Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary has any material current or
projected liability for, and no Benefit Plan provides or promises, any post-
employment medical, dental, disability, hospitalization, life or similar
benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to any current or former Employee,
Director or Independent Contractor (other than coverage mandated
by applicable Law).

(i) All Employees are currently employed by U.S. Topco or an Acquired
Subsidiary and, as of the Closing Date, will be employed by an Acquired
Subsidiary, and no offers of employment will be required in order to provide
for continuity of employment of such Employees with Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (including following the Closing, an Acquired Subsidiary)
following the Closing Date. Except to the extent disclosure would not be
permitted under applicable Laws, including applicable data privacy Laws,
Section 3.10(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of all current Employees employed in the Business
as of the Execution Date (identified by employee identification number) and
Independent Contractors retained in the Business as of the Execution Date,
identifying as to each Employee a job title, years of service, amount or rate
of compensation, most recent annual bonus received and current annual bonus
opportunity, location of employment, whether full- or part-time, whether
active or on furlough or leave (and, if on furlough or leave, the nature and
start date of the furlough or leave and the expected return date) and whether
exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. No more than ten (10) and no less
than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent will provide
Buyer with a schedule reflecting the same information as Section 3.10(i) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, updated as of such date.

 

(j) All Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained in
material compliance with their terms and all applicable Laws (including any
local regulatory or tax approval requirements), (ii) if intended to qualify
for special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for such treatment in
all material respects, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to be funded,
book-reserved or secured by an Insurance Policy, is fully funded, book-
reserved or secured by an Insurance Policy, as applicable, in all material
respects based on reasonable actuarial assumptions in accordance with
applicable accounting principles. To the Knowledge of Sellers, from and after
the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates will receive the full benefit of
any funds, accruals and reserves under the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans in all
material respects. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
threatened material Litigation relating to any of the Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

Section 4.8 _Financial Capability_.

 

(a) As of the Execution Date, Buyer has delivered to Sellers true, correct,
complete and fully executed copies of (i) a commitment letter and fee letter
associated therewith (including all attached exhibits, schedules, annexes, and
term sheets thereto that are delivered as of the Execution Date, and as
amended from time to time after the Execution Date in compliance with Section
6.12, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") dated and in effect on the Execution
Date from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto confirming their respective
commitments to provide Buyer with debt financing for the Financing Purposes
in the amount set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) a
commitment letter (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and together with the
Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Commitment Letters_ ") dated and in
effect on the Execution Date from KPS Special Situations Fund V, LP and KPS
Special Situations Fund V (A), LP (the " _Equity Financing Sources_
") confirming its commitment to provide Buyer with equity financing for the
Financing Purposes in the amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "
and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ").

(b) The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a
valid, legal and binding obligation of Buyer and the other parties thereto,
enforceable against Buyer and the other parties thereto in accordance with its
terms (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions). The Debt Commitment Letter
is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer or (as applicable) its Affiliates that are party to the Debt Commitment
Letter (the "Financing Affiliates") and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other
parties thereto, enforceable against Buyer and/ or the Financing Affiliates
(as applicable) and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions). As of
the Execution Date, none of the Financing Commitment Letters have been
amended, modified, or terminated in any respect, and the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect. As of
the Execution Date, no event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse
of time or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a

 



32

    

 breach or default under the Financing Commitment Letters on the part of
Buyer and the Financing Affiliates. All fees (if any) required to be paid
under the Financing Commitment Letters on or prior to the Execution Date have
been paid in full.

(c) There are no conditions precedent directly or indirectly related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. As of the Execution Date, Buyer
does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing that are within the control of the Buyer or the Financing
Affiliates will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will
not be available to Buyer on the date on which the Closing should occur
pursuant to Section 2.6. Other than the Financing Commitment Letters, there
are no other contracts, arrangements or understandings entered into by Buyer
and the Financing Affiliates related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the Financing except for (i) customary fee or fee credit
letters and engagement letters relating to the Debt Financing, (ii) customary
engagement letters or non-disclosure agreements which do not impact the
conditionality of the Financing or (iii) those other agreements that would
not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of any portion
of the Financing and which do not impact the conditionality of the Financing.
As of the Execution Date, a true, correct complete and fully executed copy of
each fee or fee credit letter related to the Debt Financing as in effect on
the date of this Agreement has been provided to Sellers, with only the fee
amounts, "market flex", "securities demand," (as to economic or other
commercially sensitive terms only), pricing terms, pricing caps and other
commercially sensitive terms redacted; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
redacted term provides that the aggregate amount or net cash proceeds of the
Debt Financing set forth in the unredacted portion of the Debt Commitment
Letter could be reduced below the amount necessary to consummate transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date (giving effect to
the Equity Financing), or adds any conditions or contingencies to the
availability of all or any portion of the Debt Financing (other than, in each
case, any fees, expenses, original issue discounts and similar premiums and
charges) or the enforceability of the Debt Commitment Letter. There are no
side letters or other agreements relating to the Financing Commitment Letters
that would (A) impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, to an
amount less than required to satisfy the Financing Purposes (giving effect to
the Equity Financing), (C) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise
expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing
or adversely impact the ability of Buyer or the Financing Affiliates (as
applicable) to enforce its or their (as applicable) rights against the other
parties to the Financing Commitment Letters or (D) otherwise reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and on the Closing Date.

 

(d) Assuming the Financing is funded on the Closing Date in accordance with
the Commitment Letters, the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in this Agreement, and the
performance in all material respects by the Sellers and their respective
Affiliates of its and their obligations under this Agreement, including, but
not limited to, the obligations set forth in Section 6.13, the aggregate
proceeds of the Financing are in an amount sufficient to (i) pay the amounts
payable by Buyer at the Closing pursuant to Article II and (ii) pay
all related fees and expenses of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Financing Purposes_ "). Buyer affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing that Buyer obtains financing for or related to any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



33

    

(e) The Equity Commitment Letter provides that each Seller is an express
third-party beneficiary thereto for the purpose of seeking, and is entitled to
seek, specific performance of Buyers right to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded thereunder, and, in connection therewith, each Seller has the right
to an injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or
equitable relief, to cause Buyer to cause, or to directly cause, the Equity
Financing Sources to fund, directly or indirectly, the Equity Financing as,
and to the extent permitted by, the Equity Commitment Letter, in each case,
when all of the conditions to funding the Equity Financing set forth in the
Equity Commitment Letter have been satisfied (in each case subject to Section
9.14(b)).

assets, liabilities or other financial information included in the Business
or the Acquired Assets or the quality, quantity or condition of the assets of
the Business or the Acquired Assets) are specifically disclaimed by Sellers,

upon reasonable advance notice, to the premises, assets, management-level and
other key Employees, facilities, properties, Contracts and books and records
of the Business, (ii) furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Buyer any
financial and operating data and other information that is available with

(iii) instruct the Employees, and their counsel and financial advisors to

instructing their accountants to give Buyer reasonable access to the

applicable Laws, including antitrust, competition and merger control Laws,
or would destroy any legal privilege or result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties in violation of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts from and after the Execution
Date until the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms to make appropriate substitute arrangements to

of this Agreement or any applicable Law. Sellers agree to retain, or cause to
be retained, all books, ledgers, files, reports, plans, records, manuals and

regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the extent in
each case that such access is reasonably related to any Acquired Assets or
Assumed Liabilities or otherwise necessary for Buyer to comply with the terms
of this Agreement or any applicable Law or for any reasonable business
purpose. In no event shall either Party have access under this Section 6.1(b)
to any information that (x) based on advice of counsel, would create any
potential Liability under applicable Laws, including antitrust, competition
and merger control Laws, or would destroy any legal privilege or (y) in its
reasonable judgment, would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of third parties or (B) violate any confidentiality obligations so long as,
with respect to confidentiality, such party has made reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom
is owed an obligation of confidentiality.

required under the HSR Act and Non-U.S Antitrust Laws with respect to the
Transaction as promptly as practicable after the date of

 



45

    

 this Agreement (and in any event, no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement); _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement (x) none of Sellers, Seller Parent or any of their
Affiliates may, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be required to, commit
to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or make any other
concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection with
obtaining any consent and (y) without limiting Buyers obligations under this
Section 6.3(a), without Buyers prior written consent, Sellers shall not, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, sell, divest, license or
otherwise dispose of any capital stock or other equity or voting interest,
assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses (or
commit to do any of the foregoing) in order to obtain any consent from, or
enter into any consent decrees with, a Government Entity or third party to the
transactions contemplated hereby (but if Buyer so requests, Sellers shall be
required to take any of the foregoing actions to the extent such actions
are conditioned on the Closing); provided further that, without limiting the
foregoing proviso and solely with respect to the jurisdictions set forth on
Section 6.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, if necessary, Buyer agrees
that it will use reasonable best efforts to permit the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable by entering into customary "hold separate"
arrangements with the applicable Government Entities (with the consent of such
Government Entity) with respect to the Acquired Assets in such jurisdiction
and that if such consent is received in any such jurisdiction the receipt of
the Non-U.S. Antitrust Clearances in such jurisdiction shall not be a
condition precedent to the Closing under Section 7.1(b). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Sellers will make all filings and
submissions required by any antitrust, competition and merger control Laws and
any other Laws in connection with the Transaction and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly file any additional information requested
as soon as practicable after receipt of such request therefor.

 

(b) Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other Party all
information necessary or desirable in connection with making any filing under
the HSR Act and for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any
antitrust, competition or merger control Law, and in connection
with resolving any investigation or other inquiry by any Government Entity
under any antitrust, competition or merger control Laws with respect to the
Transaction. Each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement
with, any Government Entity regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall participate in any meeting with
any Government Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of the meeting. The
Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in
connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or relating to the
HSR Act or other antitrust, competition or merger control Laws with respect to
the Transaction (including, with respect to making a particular filing, by
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing Party and their
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, giving due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection
therewith).

 



46

    

Section 6.4 _Tax Matters_ _._  

(a) _Tax Return Preparation and Filing_. Sellers shall prepare in the
Ordinary Course (except as otherwise required by applicable Law) and timely
file (A) all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by any Acquired
Subsidiary on or before the Closing (" _Acquired Subsidiary Tax Returns_ ")
and (B) except if an Asset Sale Election is made, all Applicable Tax Returns.
For the avoidance of doubt, if an Asset Sale Election is made, all obligations
under this Section 6.4(a) with respect to Applicable Tax Returns shall
terminate. Except with respect to Pending Income Tax Returns, Sellers shall
deliver drafts of all Acquired Subsidiary Tax Returns or Applicable Tax
Returns to Buyer no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date (including
extensions) on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (or as
promptly as reasonably practicable, in the case of non-income Tax Returns) for
Buyers review and comment, and Sellers shall not unreasonably fail to reflect
any comments requested by Buyer at least ten (10) days prior to the date
(including extensions) on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (in
the case of income Tax Returns) or reasonably promptly in advance of the date
(including extensions) on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (in
the case of non-income Tax Returns). With respect to Pending Income Tax
Returns: (w) Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to deliver
preliminary drafts of any Pending Income Tax Returns that are U.S. federal
income Tax Returns to Buyer for review and approval in as complete a form as
possible no later than ten (10) days following the Execution Date, (x) Sellers
shall use their reasonable best efforts to deliver final drafts of Pending
Income Tax Returns no later than five (5) days prior to the date (including
extensions) on which such Tax Returns are required to be filed, (y) Sellers
shall not unreasonably fail to reflect any comments requested by Buyer
reasonably promptly in advance of the date (including extensions) on which
such Tax Returns are required to be filed and (z) in advance of the delivery
of final drafts of Pending Income Tax Returns, the Parties shall reasonably
cooperate in timely providing information related thereto as reasonably
necessary in connection with Buyers review and comment on such Tax Returns.
No Acquired Subsidiary Tax Return or Applicable Tax Return shall be filed
without the consent of Buyer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(b) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (i) Buyer or any of Buyers Affiliates shall not make (or permit any
person to make) any elections under Section 336 or 338 of the Code (or any
analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law) with respect to any of
the Acquired Subsidiaries (excluding Subsidiaries owned by US Topco LLC, with
respect to which Buyer or its Affiliates may make an election under Section
338(g) of the Code); (ii) during the taxable year of any Acquired Subsidiary
that includes the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not cause or
permit any such Acquired Subsidiary that is a "controlled foreign corporation"
(within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code) to take any action out of
the ordinary course of business that could reasonably be expected to increase
the Subpart F Income or Tested Income of such Acquired Subsidiary in a manner
materially adverse to any Seller or its Affiliates as a result of: (a) a
limitation (including under Treasury Regulations Section 1.245A-5) of
deductions otherwise available to Seller or any of its Affiliates under
Section 245A of the Code or (b) an inclusion required to be made by any
Seller or its Affiliates under Sections 951(a) or 951A of the Code, in each
case, including any amended or successor versions and any similar provisions
of state or local law; provided, that to the extent an election is available
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.245A-5(e)(3) (or similar provision of
state or local law) to close the taxable year of any such Acquired Subsidiary,
the Parties agree to take such actions (and to cause their Affiliates to take
such actions) as reasonably necessary to effectuate such an election; and
(iii) except as required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not (and shall cause
the Acquired Subsidiaries not to) make, amend, or revoke any Tax election
that is

 



47

    

 retroactive to a taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date if
such action would adversely affect the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, in
each case, without the prior written consent of such Seller (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local or foreign or other
sales, use, value added, transfer (including real property transfer), stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes that may be imposed
or assessed as a result of the Transaction, together with any interest,
additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of
such additions or penalties (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall (to the extent not
subject to an exemption under the Bankruptcy Code) be borne 50% by Buyer and
50% by Sellers. Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer
Taxes shall be prepared by Buyer, and Sellers shall join in the execution of
any applicable Tax Returns.

 

(d) _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to
be furnished to each other, upon reasonable request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records relating
to Taxes) and assistance relating to the Business, the Acquired Subsidiaries
and the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as is reasonably
necessary for determining any Liability for Taxes, the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Government Entity and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax. Any reasonable expenses incurred in
furnishing such information or assistance pursuant to this Section 6.4(d)
shall be borne by the Party requesting it.

 

(e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Notwithstanding any other
provision in the Agreement to the contrary, all Tax Sharing Agreements (other
than such an agreement entered into in the Ordinary Course that is a customary
commercial agreement the primary subject matter of which is not Taxes) between
the Acquired Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Person (other than any
Acquired Subsidiary), on the other hand, shall be terminated prior to the
Closing Date and, after the Closing, none of the Acquired Subsidiaries will be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

(f) _Post-Signing Reorganization Covenants_.

 

(i) Seller Parent shall (A) cause each of U.S. Share Seller and U.S. TopCo
LLC (as defined in Annex K) to be debtors in the Bankruptcy Cases, (B) as
promptly as practicable, file an objection in form and substance satisfactory
to Buyer, on all bases as to which the Sellers have a good faith belief are
grounds for objection, including that all or any portion of such claims are
contingent, in respect of pre-petition Taxes of the Acquired Subsidiaries
asserted (I) (x) with respect to Taxes for any taxable year other than the
2019 and 2020 taxable years, and (y) in the case of the 2019 and 2020 taxable
years, with respect to any amounts that exceed the amount shown as due on
Seller Parents U.S. consolidated federal income Tax Return or other Tax
Return or (II) on the basis of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law), (C) promptly take all
actions to prosecute such objection and take all actions reasonably requested
by Buyer in respect thereof, including seeking a determination under Section
505 of the Bankruptcy Code, (D) not settle or delay the filing or prosecution
of such objection without the consent of Buyer and (E) cause the Post-Signing
Reorganization to be effected in accordance with Annex K.

 



48

    

(ii) Before and after Closing, Buyer, the Sellers Representative and each
Seller shall provide the other with such information as the other may
reasonably request in connection with all matters related to the Post-Signing
Reorganization.

 

(iii) Sellers agree that none of them or any of their Affiliates shall
take, or fail to take, any action to the extent such action or failure to
act, as the case may be, is inconsistent with or would otherwise prejudice the
Post-Signing Reorganization.

 

Section 6.5 _Post-Closing Obligations of the Business to Certain
Employees_.

 

(a) The Parties intend that there shall be continuity of employment with
respect to all Business Employees, and Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates (including following the Closing, an Acquired Subsidiary) to,
continue the employment of each Business Employee.

 

(b) Starting on the Closing Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary
of the Closing Date or any longer period as required under local employment
Laws or Labor Contract, or shorter period if the Business Employee ceases to
be employed by Buyer and any of its Affiliates (including an Acquired
Subsidiary), each Business Employee shall be employed by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (including an Acquired Subsidiary) (x) on terms no less favorable
than the same base salary and aggregate annual target cash bonus and cash
long-term incentive award opportunities (and/or opportunities under sales
incentive plans and/or regional incentive plans); _provided_ that long-term
incentive award opportunities may be provided in the form of cash or equity or
a combination thereof, and (y) with employee benefits (other than equity or
equity-based benefits, defined pension benefits and retiree medical benefits)
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to such
Business Employee by Sellers, the Acquired Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, and shall be offered
any other additional terms and conditions of employment required by applicable
Law or Labor Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
Section 6.5(b), a Business Employees base salary, annual target cash bonus
and cash long-term incentive award opportunities shall be those opportunities
established for fiscal year 2020 prior to any decreases in base salary or
waiver or forfeiture of any actual payment of such awards in connection with
changes to Sellers and the Acquired Subsidiaries compensation programs in
response to COVID-19. Nothing in this Section 6.5(b) is intended to limit
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Subsidiary) from
taking or continuing to take reasonable actions in response to ongoing
COVID-19 related stresses on the Business after the Closing Date, including
reductions in force, furloughs, temporary layoffs, or reduced hours, pay or
benefits.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, starting
on the Closing Date, Buyer shall, for a period ending on the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, maintain a severance pay practice for the
benefit of each Business Employee that is no less favorable than the
severance pay practice provided by Sellers and their respective Affiliates to
such Business Employee as of the Execution Date as disclosed on Section 6.5(c)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Buyer shall assume all liabilities
and obligations to provide any severance to any Business Employee whose
employment is terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates upon or following the
Closing in connection with the consummation of the Transaction.

 



49

    

(d) Buyer shall (i) provide coverage for the Business Employees under
medical, dental and health and welfare plans as of the Closing Date, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition, actively at work requirements and waiting periods and (iii) cause
such plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Business Employees and their
beneficiaries under similar Benefit Plans of Sellers and their respective
Affiliates during the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and
maximum out-of-pocket expenses. Business Employees shall be given credit for
all service with Sellers or any of their Affiliates (including their
predecessors), to the same extent as such service was credited for such
purpose by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, under each Buyer Plan in which
such Business Employees are eligible to participate for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than under a defined benefit
pension plan in which no assets are transferred pursuant to this Agreement or
where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service).

(e) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer and/or its Affiliates shall assume
from Sellers (and from and after the Closing pay, perform, discharge or
otherwise satisfy in accordance with their terms), and Sellers shall convey,
transfer, and assign to Buyer and/or its Affiliates, to the extent not paid,
performed, discharged or otherwise satisfied prior to Closing, all Liabilities
at any time arising under, pursuant to or in connection with the Benefit Plans
set forth on Section 6.5(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, those Benefit Plans sponsored or maintained by
Sellers), including assuming the sponsorship of the Benefit Plans, and all
Liabilities for compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code
with respect to all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulation section 54.4980B-9.

 

(f) Prior to the Adjustment Time, Sellers or the Acquired Subsidiaries, as
applicable, shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to
the estimated maximum aggregate amount of severance payments and cost of
benefits that could become payable or provided to all Covered Employees upon a
Qualifying Good Reason Termination in a manner consistent with the applicable
terms of the Designated Officer Severance Plan (as set forth in the Designated
Officer Severance Plan and Schedule 6.5(c)(2)) as determined by the Plan
Administrator (the " _Good Reason Escrow_ "). In the event that a Covered
Employee provides written notice alleging the existence of grounds for a
termination of employment for "good reason," Buyer shall notify Sellers of
such notice promptly. If such Covered Employees employment
actually terminates due to a Qualifying Good Reason Termination as determined
in good faith by the Plan Administrator, an amount in cash in respect of such
severance payments and benefits payable or to be provided to such Covered
Employee in a manner consistent with the applicable terms of the Designated
Officer Severance Plan, as determined by the Plan Administrator, shall be
distributed to the Buyer or, at the Buyers direction, to an Acquired
Subsidiary from the Good Reason Escrow for payment or the provision of such
benefits to the Covered Employee. Upon the later of (i) one hundred and twenty
(120) days following the Closing (subject to any pending determinations at
such time) and (ii) the date which the Plan Administrator determines that
there are no pending determinations in respect of Qualifying Good Reason
Terminations, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release the remaining Good
Reason Escrow amounts to Sellers or their Bankruptcy Estates. All releases
from escrow pursuant to this Section 6.5(f) shall require Sellers to provide
five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Buyer. All determinations of
the Plan Administrator under this Section 6.5(f) shall be made in good faith.

 



50

    

(g) Within five (5) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Sellers and
Acquired Subsidiaries shall provide the Buyer with a list, by date and site of
employment (as that term is defined by applicable WARN laws), of (i) permanent
employee layoffs implemented by the Sellers and Acquired Subsidiaries
with respect to Employees in the ninety (90) calendar day period preceding
the Closing Date and any WARN notices provided to such Employees and their
union (if applicable) and applicable Government Entities, and (ii) temporary
employee layoffs implemented by the Sellers and Acquired Subsidiaries with
respect to Employees in the six (6) month period preceding the Closing Date,
including date of initial temporary layoff, site of employment and the total
number of employees at the site of employment at the time of the temporary
layoff and as of the Closing Date, the number of employees returned to active
duty at each site of employment as of the Closing Date, as well as any written
communications provided by the Sellers and Acquired Subsidiaries to such
employees about the temporary layoffs. The Sellers and Acquired Subsidiaries
shall be exclusively responsible for any liability or obligation under WARN
triggered by actions taken or not taken by the Sellers and Acquired
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, as well as severance pay due to
any Employee separations prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall be
exclusively responsible for severance pay and any other liability or
obligation under WARN for any employment losses or Employee separations of
Business Employees after the Closing Date, except for employment terminations
of Business Employees announced by the Sellers or the Acquired Subsidiaries to
become effective on or after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , if actions
taken by the Sellers and Acquired Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date
that would not have triggered a WARN notice obligation by themselves are
combined with actions taken by the Buyer after the Closing Date that would
trigger a WARN notice obligation when combined with the Sellers and Acquired
Subsidiaries pre-Closing actions of which the Buyer has notice, then the Buyer
is responsible for any liability or obligation under WARN in this
circumstance.

(h) If any Business Employee requires a work visa, work permit or
employment pass or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her
employment to continue with Buyer, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate to
cause any such visa, permit, pass or other approval to be obtained or renewed,
as applicable, and in effect prior to the Closing.

(i) Nothing in this 6.5(h) or any other provision of this Agreement,
whether express or implied, is intended to, or shall: (i) constitute the
establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan
for purposes of ERISA or applicable Law or otherwise be treated as an
amendment or modification of any Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan; (ii) limit the
right of any Seller, Acquired Subsidiary, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan or Buyer
Plan; or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary or other right (x) in any
Person, including any current or former employee of Sellers, Acquired
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, any participant in any
Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) or (y)
to employment or continued employment for any period of time or particular
term or condition of employment with any Party.

 



51

    

Section 6.6 _Insurance_ ___Obligations_.

 

(a) From time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have the right to make claims and the right to any proceeds with
respect to any matter related to the Business, the Acquired Subsidiaries, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities under any Insurance Policies
retained by Sellers (including any Insurance Policies to which Sellers
have access, whether through contract, because any Seller is the named
insured or otherwise, in respect of any occurrences prior to the Spin-Off
Date) following Closing for occurrence-based claims pertaining to, arising
out of and inuring to the benefit of any Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates for all periods prior to the Closing, and each Seller shall take
all actions to allow Buyer to seek recovery (including by executing or
delivering any document, agreement, instrument or other information as Buyer
may reasonably request to seek such recovery) under such Insurance Policies.
Sellers shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, assign, to the
extent assignable, to Buyer any proceeds of Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates Insurance Policies to the extent related to the
Business, the Acquired Subsidiaries, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities. Sellers agree to use, or cause their respective Affiliates to
use, their respective reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents or
approvals of any insurance company or other third party relating to any such
assignment. If such proceeds are not assignable, Sellers agree to pay any
such proceeds received by Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates to
Buyer promptly upon the receipt thereof.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall obtain, maintain and fully pay for
extended discovery period coverage for any of its claims made Insurance
Policies, in each case to the extent such Insurance Policies are not held by
Acquired Subsidiaries or otherwise transferred to Buyer at the Closing.

 

Section 6.7 _Trademarks_. From and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall
(and shall cause each of its Affiliates to) cease and discontinue, as
promptly as practicable and in any case within three (3) months of the Closing
Date, any and all use of the Trademarks constituting or incorporating
"Honeywell" or that are included in the Acquired Intellectual Property and
remove any and all such Trademarks from any and all assets in their respective
possession or control (including any publications, signage, corporate
letterhead, stationery, business cards, marketing materials or content,
internet or other electronic communications vehicles or other materials or as
part of Sellers corporate name). Neither Sellers nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall challenge or oppose, or authorize or knowingly facilitate
any third party to challenge or oppose, the rights of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Subsidiaries) in the
Trademarks constituting "Honeywell" or that are included in the Acquired
Intellectual Property anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller and its Affiliates may, after the Closing Date, (a) use any such
Trademark in a nominative manner in textual sentences referencing the
historical relationship between Seller, on the one hand, and an Acquired
Subsidiary, on the other hand, (b) retain copies of any books, records and
other materials included in the Excluded Assets that, as of the Closing Date,
contain or display any such Trademark and such copies are used solely for
internal or archival purposes (and not public display) or (c) use any such
Trademark solely to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Laws or for
litigation, regulatory or corporate filings and documents filed by Seller or
any of its Affiliates with any Government Entity.

 



52

    

Section 6.8 _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing
Date, each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents or
instruments of transfer reasonably requested by another Party and necessary
for the requesting Party to satisfy its obligations hereunder or to obtain
the benefits of the Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent that (i) Buyer or Sellers discover following Closing
that any right, property or asset that was intended to be transferred to
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement was not transferred at Closing (or Sellers
receive any payment or proceeds related to any Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability), Sellers shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly to assign and transfer to Buyer all right, title and interest in such
right, property or asset (or proceeds therefrom), or (ii) Buyer or Sellers
discover following the Closing that any Liability that was not intended to be
transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement was transferred at Closing,
Sellers shall promptly assume such Liability without any further obligation of
Buyer. The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to effect any transfers or
other arrangements described in this Section 6.8 in a manner that is Tax
efficient for each of the Parties and their Affiliates.

 

Section 6.9 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall treat as confidential and
safeguard any and all information, knowledge and data related to the Acquired
Assets or Assumed Liabilities by using the same degree of care, but no less
than a reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized use,
dissemination or disclosure of such information, knowledge and data
as Sellers or their respective Affiliates used with respect thereto prior to
the execution of this Agreement, and shall not disclose any such information,
knowledge or data without the prior written consent of Buyer (except to the
extent required by applicable Law, in which case Sellers will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, give prior written notice to Buyer of such
disclosure and reasonably cooperate with Buyers efforts (at Buyers expense)
to obtain a protective order and/or confidential treatment for such
information); _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers and their Affiliates may
disclose such information, knowledge and data (other than trade secrets) to
the extent reasonably necessary to prosecute or defend against any Litigation
that is an Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, respectively.

(b) Buyer shall treat as confidential and safeguard any and all
information, knowledge or data to the extent related to the Excluded Assets
that becomes known to Buyer as a result of the Transaction except as otherwise
agreed to by Sellers in writing (except to the extent disclosure is required
by applicable Law, in which case Buyer will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, give prior written notice to Sellers of such disclosure and
reasonably cooperate with Sellers efforts (at Sellers expense) to obtain a
protective order and/or confidential treatment for such information);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Section 6.9(b) shall prevent the
disclosure of any such information, knowledge or data to any directors,
officers or employees of Buyer to whom such disclosure is necessary or
desirable in the conduct of the Business if such Persons are informed by Buyer
of the confidential nature of such information and are directed by Buyer to
comply with the provisions of this Section 6.9(b).

(c) Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations set
forth in this Section 6.9 shall not extend to information, knowledge and data
that is publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act or
omission of the Party owing a duty of confidentiality, or becomes available on
a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Party owing a duty of
confidentiality (or, in the case of Sellers, a source relating to Sellers
prior

 



53

    

 ownership of the Acquired Subsidiaries or the Business) so long as such
source is not known by such Party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement
with or other obligations of secrecy to the other Party.

(d) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or
Sellers, the other Party, in addition to all other available remedies, will
be entitled to relief pursuant to the terms of Section 9.14.

 

Section 6.10 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees (i) that all rights to indemnification and/or advancement
of expenses now existing in favor of the directors and officers of any
Acquired Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ "), as provided in the Organizational Documents of such Acquired
Subsidiary in effect as of the Execution Date, in each case with respect to
any matters occurring prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing and
shall continue in full force and effect for a period not less than six (6)
years after the Closing Date and (ii) that the Acquired Subsidiaries shall
perform and discharge their respective obligations to provide such
indemnification and/or advancement of expenses for a period not less than six
(6) years after the Closing Date. Any indemnification and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions contained in the Organizational Documents
of the Acquired Subsidiaries shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period not less than six (6) years after the Closing in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
as of the Closing or at any time prior to the Closing, were Indemnitees,
unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

 

(b) As of the Execution Date, the Acquired Subsidiaries have obtained and
fully paid for (i) extensions of Seller Parents current directors and
officers liability insurance policies through April 1, 2021 and (ii)
"discovery periods" of six (6) years on such insurance policies to run from
the earlier of certain triggers, including, without limitation, (I) the
Closing Date and (II) April 1, 2021. Following the Closing, neither Sellers
nor Buyer shall cancel or otherwise reduce coverage under any directors and
officers liability insurance policy purchased by Sellers or the Acquired
Subsidiaries prior to Closing for which any Indemnitee is a beneficiary;
_provided that_ no payments shall be required of Buyer or the Acquired
Subsidiaries with respect to such insurance policies after Closing. Sellers
shall not amend such insurance policies or take any action that would cause
the running of such "discovery periods" prior to the Closing without Buyers
prior written consent. Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide access to such insurance policies to the Indemnitees.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.10 shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnitee, their heirs and their legal representatives and shall be binding
on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Acquired Subsidiaries, and may
not be terminated or modified in any manner adverse to such Persons without
their prior written consent, unless such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law.

 



54

    

Section 6.11 _Intercompany Accounts and Intercompany Arrangements_.

(a) Prior to the Adjustment Time, all obligations, balances and accounts
among Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Acquired
Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and any Acquired Subsidiary, on the other
hand, shall be settled or otherwise eliminated without any further Liability
to any Acquired Subsidiary. Immediately prior to the Closing, except for (x)
the documents to be entered into in connection with this Agreement or (y) the
Contracts set forth on Section 6.11 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all
Related Party Agreements (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Benefit
Plan) shall automatically be terminated without further payment or performance
and cease to have any further force and effect, such that neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries) shall have any
further Liabilities therefor or thereunder; _provided_ that prior to taking
any action to terminate or reject any Related Party Agreement, Sellers shall

maintain in effect the Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter

a waiver thereof, on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer in the

Commitment Letters and (vi) comply in all material respects with its

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to
the Closing, Buyer shall give Sellers prompt written notice (x) of any
material breach or material default by any party to the Financing Commitment
Letters, or any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing, in each
case of which Buyer becomes aware, (y) of the receipt by Buyer of any written
notice or other written communication, in each case received from any Debt
Financing Sources Related Party, with respect to any (1) (I) actual or
potential material breach of Buyers obligations under the Financing
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing,
(II) actual or potential breach material default, termination or repudiation
by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements
related to the Debt Financing, or (III) portion of the Financing not being
reasonably expected to be available to Buyer to finance in full the Financing
Purposes on the Closing Date or (2) material dispute between or among any
parties to the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related
to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the Financing Commitment Letters
and (z) if prior to the Closing Date, the Financing Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing expire or are terminated.
Promptly following delivery by Sellers to Buyer of a written request
therefore, Buyer shall provide any information reasonably requested by such
Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer be under any
obligation to disclose any information pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) that
would (x) breach any binding obligation of confidentiality or (y) waive the
protection of attorney client or similar privilege if such party shall have
used reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would
not waive such privilege.

 

(c) Buyer shall have the right from time to time to amend, supplement,
terminate or otherwise modify or waive its rights under the Financing
Commitment Letters, including to (i) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter in
order to obtain alternative sources of financing in lieu of all or a portion
of the Debt Financing, including in a private placement of securities
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) add and appoint
additional arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, initial purchasers, agents,
lenders and similar entities to provide for the assignment and reallocation of
a portion of the financing commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter and to grant customary approval rights to such additional arrangers and
other entities in connection with such appointments; _provided_ __ that, no
such amendment, supplement, termination, modification or waiver shall (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of available Debt Financing to less than the
amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(taking into account any increase to the Equity Financing), (B) impose new or
additional conditions precedent or expand upon, amend or modify the conditions
precedent to the Financing as set forth in the existing Financing Commitment
Letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
Closing, make the timely funding of Financing or satisfaction of the
conditions precedent to the Financing less likely to occur, or adversely
affect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against other parties with
respect to the Financing or (C) contain provisions that would reasonably be
expected to impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (D) otherwise adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Prohibited Financing
Modifications_ ").

 

(d) Buyer shall furnish to Sellers a copy of any executed written
amendment, replacement, supplement, modification, waiver or consent relating
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing. For purposes of this Agreement (other than with respect to
representations in this Agreement made by Buyer that 

 



56

    

 speak as of the Execution Date), references to the "Debt Commitment Letter"
shall include such document as permitted or required by this Section 6.12 to
be amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived, in each
case from and after such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification or waiver and, for the avoidance of doubt, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include, in whole or in part (as applicable), any
replacement or substitute financing provided for thereunder, provided that any
such replacement or substitute financing shall not impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
receipt of the Financing that, if styled as amendments or modifications to the
initial Debt Commitment Letter, would constitute Prohibited Financing
Modifications, or otherwise effect any Prohibited Financing Modifications.

 

(e) In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes, or would
reasonably be expected to become, unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex provisions)
(other than as a direct result of the Sellers breach of any provision of this
Agreement or failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or
7.3), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (A) arrange and obtain
any such portion from alternative sources, on terms that are, taken as a
whole, no more adverse to Buyer than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter
(including after giving effect to the market flex provisions) or that are
otherwise acceptable to Buyer (" _Alternative Financing_ "), as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event and (B) provide Sellers
with a copy of the new financing commitment that provides for such Alternative
Financing (the " _Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_ "); _provided_ that
the terms of such Alternative Financing shall not effect any Prohibited
Financing Modifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be required to pay any fees or any
interest rates applicable to the Debt Financing in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the Execution Date
(including the market flex provisions), or agree to any term (including any
market flex term) less favorable to Buyer in any material respect than such
term contained in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof.
As applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to
representations in this Agreement made by Buyer that speak as of the date
hereof) to (i) the Financing or Debt Financing shall include such Alternative
Financing and (ii) to any Financing Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment
Letter shall include the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter.

 

(f) In furtherance of, and subject to the conditions set forth in, the
provisions of this Section 6.12, including with respect to Prohibited
Financing Modifications, the Debt Commitment Letter may be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Buyer after
the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing by instruments (the "
_New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters_ ") that either amend, amend and
restate, or replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters or contemplate co-
investment by or financing from one or more other or additional parties. As
applicable, references in this Agreement (other than with respect to
representations in this Agreement made by Buyer that speak as of the date
hereof) to (i) the Financing or Debt Financing shall include the financing
contemplated by any New or Amended Debt Commitment Letters (and as applicable,
supersede the prior existing Debt Financing) and (ii) to any Financing
Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter shall include any New or Amended
Debt Commitment Letter (and as applicable, superseded the prior existing Debt
Commitment Letter).

 



57

if they were the Buyer hereunder.

action that would subject any Seller or any of its Subsidiaries respective
directors, managers, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel or other
Representatives to any personal liability; or

undertakings, where restricted from doing so by law or regulation, or that

for purposes of Article VII or a breach of the condition precedent set forth
in Section 7.2(b), unless such breach is a material breach and directly
results in the Debt Financing not being available to Buyer (or its Financing
Affiliates), and a breach by Sellers or their Subsidiaries of
their obligations under Section 6.13(b) shall not constitute a breach of this

in part) in the Debt Financing not being available to Buyer (or its Financing
Affiliates).

prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by written agreement of Buyer and Seller Parent;

 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller Parent, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if any Prohibition permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transaction has
become final and non-appealable so long as the reason for the Prohibition
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the Transaction is not due to the terminating Partys material breach of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

 

(c) by either Buyer or Seller Parent, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to March 31, 2021 (the " _Outside Date_ ") so long as the reason that
the Closing has not occurred prior to the Outside Date is not due to the
terminating Partys material breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements under this Agreement;

 



67

    

(d) by either Buyer or Seller Parent, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other Party, if (i) Sellers enter into a definitive

not the prevailing party at the conclusion of the Auction held in accordance
with the Bidding Procedures Order (if the Auction is held), or (ii) the
Bankruptcy Court approves an Alternative Transaction other than with Buyer;

 

(e) by Seller Parent, by giving written notice of such termination to
Buyer, if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty shall have become untrue after the Execution Date, in either case,
such that Section 7.3(a) and/or Section 7.3(b) (as applicable) would not be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
is given by Seller Parent to Buyer and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
that (x) Seller Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if any Seller is then in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
such that Section 7.2(a) and/or Section 7.2(b) (as applicable) would not be
satisfied (for this purpose, disregarding any cure periods contained therein)
and (y) subject to clause (x) above, the failure of Buyer to consummate the
Closing within two (2) Business Days of the date required pursuant to Section
2.6 shall be deemed to be a breach of a covenant by Buyer that permits Seller
Parent to terminate this Agreement immediately upon such breach pursuant to
this Section 8.1(e);

(f) by Buyer, by giving written notice of such termination to Seller
Parent, if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made by Sellers in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty shall have become untrue after the Execution Date, in either case,
such that Section 7.2(a) and/or Section 7.2(b) (as applicable) would not be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within the earlier of (i) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof
is given by Buyer to Seller Parent and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(f) if Buyer is then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement such that Section
7.3(a) and/or Section 7.3(b) (as applicable) would not be satisfied (for this
purpose, disregarding any cure periods contained therein);

 

(g) by Buyer, by giving written notice of such termination to Seller
Parent, if (i) any of the Bankruptcy Court Milestones have not been met
(subject to extension as contemplated herein), (ii) the Bankruptcy Cases are
dismissed or converted to a case or cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code, and neither such dismissal nor conversion expressly contemplates the
Transaction or (iii) Sellers withdraw or seek authority to withdraw any motion
seeking Bankruptcy Court material relief contemplated herein, including
confirmation of the Plan, unless (1) Sellers have previously notified Buyer
in writing of Sellers plan to refile such motion at such later time that will
satisfy all the Milestones and (2) Buyer has provided written consent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such plan; or

 

(h) by Buyer, upon a termination of the RSA.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_ (a) . In the event of the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
thereafter become void and have no effect,

 



68

    

 and no Party shall have any liability to any other Party or their respective
Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers or employees, except for
the obligations of the Parties contained in this Section 8.2 and in Article
IX (and any related definitional provisions set forth in Article I).

 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement for any reason other than
Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(e), Sellers shall pay Buyer, in accordance with
the terms hereof and, following its entry, the Bidding Procedures Order, the
Expense Reimbursement Payment. In addition to any Expense Reimbursement
Payment, in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d), Section 8.1(f), Section 8.1(g)(i) (but only with respect to the
Bankruptcy Milestone in Section 5.1(c)(ix)) and Section 8.1(g)(iii) Sellers
shall pay Buyer, in accordance with the terms hereof and, following its
entry, the Bidding Procedures Order, the Termination Payment. If payable, the
Termination Payment and Expense Reimbursement Payment shall each be paid
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, if this Agreement
is terminated by Seller Parent, or on the second (2nd) Business Day following
the date of such termination, if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer. Upon
filing the Bankruptcy Cases, the Termination Payment and the Expense
Reimbursement Payment shall constitute an allowed superpriority administrative
claim against Sellers bankruptcy estates pursuant to sections 105(a), 363,
364, 503(b), and 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, with priority over all
other administrative expenses of the kind, including any claim granted

financing facility or to continue to access cash collateral following the
commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases.

(c) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e), Buyer shall, on the second (2nd) Business Day following the date of
such termination, pay Seller Parent the Reverse Termination Payment.

remedies provided by law.

 

Section 9.4 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement

the provisions of Section 2.11, no Party may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of Law or

or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for Section 6.10

solely in connection with claims arising out of or related to this Agreement
or the Transaction (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of

shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.14 _Specific Performance_.

provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to Section
9.14(b), the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of
this Agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the Parties obligation to consummate the
Transaction), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates be entitled to, or
permitted to seek, specific performance in respect of any Debt Financing
Sources; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that this sentence shall not limit
Sellers rights to enforce Buyers obligations under this Agreement (including
Section 6.12) in accordance with the terms hereof. Each of the Parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a
remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post
security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is
acknowledged and agreed that Sellers shall be entitled to specific
performance of Buyers obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter and to consummate the Closing only in
the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) all
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied

satisfied at the Closing itself, which conditions would be satisfied at the

Section 2.6, (ii) the proceeds of the Debt Financing have been funded (or the

73

performance under Section 9.14, the Reverse Termination Payment shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Sellers and any other Person against

two hundred fourteen million Dollars ($214,000,000), subject to adjustment to
reflect (x) any of the matters included in (ii)  (v) of the definition of
"Purchase Price" which (A) were reflected in the calculation of the Purchase
Price (as determined in accordance with Section 2.13) and (B) were directly
attributable to the U.S. Equity and (y) the net intercompany positions set
forth below. The intercompany payables and receivables below shall only be
used for purposes of allocating the U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S. Purchase
Price; _provided that_ in any case the net effect of including such
intercompany payables and receivables on the Purchase Price shall be $0. In
addition, any Liabilities of U.S. Topco or U.S. Topco LLC that are taken into
account as amounts realized for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall be
allocated to the U.S. Equity. For purposes of this Annex G, in the event that

(b) The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Acquired Assets
(excluding Acquired Shares) shall be determined by a third party valuation of
the Acquired Assets (excluding the Acquired Shares). Seller Parent and Buyer
shall mutually agree and retain the Independent Accountant to perform such
third party valuation. All fees incurred to obtain a third-party valuation

a Liability to the Non-U.S. Shares _._

   

Annex H

 

Form of Seller Estimate and Post-Closing Statement

 

 _Notes_ : In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Annex H
and the Agreement or any of the definitions set forth therein, the terms and
definitions set forth in the Agreement shall prevail. As set forth in this
Annex H ( _Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation_ ), the Base Purchase Price
as allocated to the U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S. Purchase Price below is
illustrative only and shall not be determinative of the allocation between the
U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S. Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.12 and
Annex G ( _Allocation of Purchase Price_ ). The allocated amounts set forth
below have been prepared in accordance with the methodology set forth in
paragraph (a) of Annex G ( _Allocation of Purchase Price_ ), and reflect the
impact of net intercompany positions among U.S. Topco Acquired Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any Non-U.S. TopCo Acquired Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, as of June 30, 2020. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate Purchase
Price is calculated without reference to the U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S.
Purchase Price and the impact of net intercompany positions between
Acquired Subsidiaries on the aggregate Purchase Price shall be $0.

(as of June 30, 2020)

 

 _Notes_ : In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Annex I
and the Agreement or any of the definitions set forth therein, the terms and
definitions set forth in the Agreement shall prevail. As set forth in this
Annex I ( _Illustrative Purchase Price Calculation_ ), the Base Purchase Price
as allocated to the U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S. Purchase Price below is
illustrative only and shall not be determinative of the allocation between the
U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S. Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.12 and
Annex G ( _Allocation of Purchase Price_ ). The allocated amounts set forth
below have been prepared in accordance with the methodology set forth in
paragraph (a) of Annex G ( _Allocation of Purchase Price_ ), and reflect the
impact of net intercompany positions among U.S. Topco Acquired Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any Non-U.S. TopCo Acquired Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, as of June 30, 2020. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate Purchase
Price is calculated without reference to the U.S. Purchase Price and Non-U.S.
Purchase Price and the impact of net intercompany positions between
Acquired Subsidiaries on the aggregate Purchase Price shall be $0.
