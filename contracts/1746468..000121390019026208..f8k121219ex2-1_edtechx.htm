AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION is made and entered into as of
December 12, 2019, by and among EdtechX Holdings Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _EdtechX_ "), Meten EdtechX Education Group Ltd., a
Cayman Islands exempted company (" _Holdco_ "), Meten Education Inc., a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (" _EdtechX Merger
Sub_ "), Meten Education Group Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco (" _Meten Merger Sub_ ", and together with
EdtechX Merger Sub, the " _Merger Subs_ "), and Meten International
Education Group, a Cayman Islands exempted company (" _Company_ "). The term
" _Agreement_ " as used herein refers to this Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization, as the same may be amended from time to time, and all
schedules hereto (including the Company Schedule and EdtechX Schedule, as
defined in the preambles to _Articles III_ and _IV_ hereof,
respectively). Each of EdtechX, Holdco, the Merger Subs, and the Company
shall be referred to herein, individually, as a " _Party_ " and,
collectively, as the " _Parties_ ". Except as otherwise indicated, capitalized
terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed
to them in _Section 11.3_.

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Companies Law
(the " _Companies Law_ "), Cap. 22 (Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and
revised) of the Cayman Islands (collectively, the " _Corporate Law_ "), the
Parties intend to enter into a business combination transaction by which (i)
Meten Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company being
the surviving entity of such merger (the " _Meten Merger_ ") and becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (" _Surviving Cayman Islands Company_
") and (ii) EdtechX Merger Sub will merge with and into EdtechX, with EdtechX
being the surviving entity of the merger (the " _EdtechX Merger_ " and
together with the Meten Merger, the " _Mergers_ ") and becoming a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Holdco (" _Surviving Delaware Corporation_ "), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

B. Holdco is a newly formed entity formed for the purpose of consummating the
Mergers, and upon completion of the Mergers and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, Holdco will become the sole direct owner of EdtechX and the
Company and will register with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("
_SEC_ ") as a publicly traded company.

  



  

C. (i) The boards of directors of each of the Merger Subs and Holdco have
approved this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Mergers
and other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best
interests of, their respective companies and their respective stockholders
and shareholders, (ii) Holdco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of
EdtechX Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement, the EdtechX Merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) Holdco, in its
capacity as the sole shareholder of Meten Merger Sub, has approved this
Agreement, the Meten Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

D. The boards of directors of each of EdtechX and the Company has approved
this Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Mergers and other
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests of,
their respective companies and their respective stockholders or shareholders.

E. The Parties intend, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the EdtechX
Merger, taken together with the Meten Merger, shall constitute a transaction
that qualifies as an exchange governed by Section 351 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

Article I _ 
  
 THE METEN MERGER_

  



  

1.1  _The Meten Merger_. On the Closing Date and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
Corporate Law, Meten Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the
separate corporate existence of Meten Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company
shall continue as the Surviving Cayman Islands Company after the Meten
Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. The Meten Merger will be
effected immediately upon the filing and registration of a duly executed Plan
of Merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit D_ with the Cayman Islands
Registrar of Companies, or at such other time as may be agreed by EdtechX and
the Company in writing and specified in the Plan of Merger (the "
_First Effective Time_ "). The effect of the Meten Merger will be as provided
in this Agreement, the Plan of Merger, and the applicable provisions of the
Corporate Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the First Effective Time, all of the property, rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company
and Meten Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Cayman Islands Company.

  



  

1.2  _Governing Documents_. At the First Effective Time, the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of Meten Merger Sub shall become the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of the Surviving Cayman Islands Company, except that
the name of the Surviving Cayman Islands Company shall be Meten International
Education Group.

  



  

1.3  _Effect on Company Securities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the First Effective Time, by virtue of the Meten Merger
and this Agreement and without any further action on the part of the Parties
or the holders of any of the securities of the Company, the following shall
occur:

  



  

(a)  _Treatment of Company Equity Awards._ Each option (the " _Option_ ")
issued and outstanding pursuant to the Company ESOP Plan prior to the Closing
and exercisable for ordinary shares of the Company, par value $0.0001 ("
_Company Ordinary Shares_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by
Holdco and automatically converted into an option to purchase Holdco Shares
(each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Each Assumed Option will be subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in the Company ESOP Plan and the Option award
agreement evidencing the grants thereof and shall be assumed by Holdco at the
First Effective Time (except any references therein to the "Company" or
"Common Stock" will instead mean Holdco and Holdco Share, respectively) and
shall (i) constitute the right to acquire a number of Holdco Shares equal to
(as rounded down to the nearest whole number) the product of (A)(1) 48,391,607
Holdco Shares, divided by (2) the total number of Company Ordinary Shares
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Effective Time
(excluding Company Ordinary Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
1.3(d)_ ), multiplied by (B) the number of Company Ordinary Shares subject to
the unexercised portion of such Option, (ii) be subject to the same vesting
schedule as the applicable Option, and (iii) have an exercise price per share
equal to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent) the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of such Option prior to its assumption, divided by
(B)(1) 48,391,607 Holdco Shares, divided by (2) the total number of Company
Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the First
Effective Time (excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section
1.3(d)_ ). The adjustments described herein shall, to the extent necessary to
preserve tax-qualified attributes (in the case of incentive stock options)
and exemption from Section 409A (for all options), be effected in a manner
that is consistent with Sections 409A and 424(a) of the Code. Upon the Second
Effective Time, Holdco shall reserve a total number of Holdco Shares ("ESOP
Shares") equal to the sum of (i) 3,050,701 Holdco Shares reserved for
issuance upon exercise of the Assumed Options (" _Rollover ESOP Shares_ ")
and (ii) such number of Holdco Shares equal to one percent (1%) of the total
issued and outstanding Holdco Shares upon the Second Effective Time, for
issuance pursuant to the Holdco ESOP Plan.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

(b)  _Conversion of Company Ordinary Shares_. Each Company Ordinary Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will be
automatically converted, at the First Effective Time, into the right to
receive (i) such number of Holdco Shares equal to their pro rata portion of
an aggregate of 48,391,607 Holdco Shares (the " _Meten Merger Shares_ "), or
Cash Consideration in lieu of Meten Merger Shares, if payable in accordance
with _Section 1.3(c)_ , and (ii) their pro rata portion of an aggregate of
11,000,000 Holdco Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 1.10_ below ("
_Contingent Shares_ ", and together with the Meten Merger Shares, the
Rollover ESOP Shares and any Cash Consideration issued in lieu of Meten
Merger Shares, the " _Meten Merger Consideration_ "), and the holders thereof
shall cease to have any further rights as holders of Company Ordinary Shares.
Each certificate that evidenced Company Ordinary Shares immediately prior to
the Meten Merger (" _Company Ordinary Share Certificate_ ") shall entitle the
holder to the applicable number of Holdco Shares into which the Company
Ordinary Share Certificate is convertible according to this _Section 1.3(b)_.

  



  

(c)  _Cash Election. If_ the funds contained in the Trust Fund at Closing,
less amounts paid and to be paid to Converting Stockholders pursuant to
_Section 7.12(a)(ii)(A)_ , and together with the proceeds from the Azimut
Investment and the Financing, exceeds $30,000,000, EdtechX shall pay fifty
percent (50%) of such excess up to an aggregate of $10,000,000 (" _Cash
Consideration_ ") in cash to Company Shareholders in lieu of issuing up to
961,538 Meten Merger Shares, in the proportions and to the electing
Company Shareholders as set forth in the Letters of Transmittal. If the Cash
Consideration is payable, the aggregate number of Meten Merger Shares that
Company Shareholders are entitled to receive as Meten Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_ shall be reduced in an amount equal to 96,154
shares for every $1,000,000 of cash paid by EdtechX. Solely for illustrative
purposes, if EdtechX pays $5,000,000 in cash, the number of Meten Merger
Shares shall be reduced by 480,769, to 47,910,838; if EdtechX
pays $10,000,000 in cash, the number of Meten Merger Shares shall be reduced
by 961,538, to 47,430,069.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

(d)  _Cancellation of Treasury and EdtechX-Owned Shares_. Each Company
Ordinary Share held by the Company or EdtechX or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary thereof immediately prior to the First Effective Time
shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion or payment in
respect thereof.

  



  

1.4  _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a)  _Exchange Procedures_. Each holder of Company Ordinary Shares ("
_Company Shareholders_ ") shall execute and deliver to the Company a letter
of transmittal in the form specified by the Company (each, a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of
this Agreement, which shall include the number of Holdco Shares issuable as
Meten Merger Shares and, if payable pursuant to _Section 1.3(c)_ , the Company
Shareholder's election to receive Cash Consideration, the amount of Cash
Consideration to be paid to such Company Shareholder in lieu of Meten Merger
Shares, and an acknowledgement of, and agreement to be bound by, the
indemnification provisions set forth in _Article X_. The Company shall
provide copies of all Letters of Transmittal to EdtechX not later than
eighteen (18) Business Days after the date of this Agreement. At the Closing,
the Company Shareholders shall deliver their Company Ordinary Share
Certificates to Holdco for cancellation, or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Ordinary Share Certificate, will deliver to Holdco an
affidavit (and indemnity if required) in the manner provided in _Section 1.5_
below, and receive in exchange therefor the Meten Merger Consideration as set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal, and the Company Ordinary Share
Certificates shall be cancelled. From and after the First Effective Time,
each outstanding Company Ordinary Share Certificate will be deemed to evidence
only the right to receive the Meten Merger Consideration as prescribed by
this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Company Ordinary Shares with a record date after the First
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company
Ordinary Share Certificates with respect to the Meten Merger Consideration
(including any Contingent Shares, if and when issued and to the extent the
related holder is entitled to receive such Contingent Shares pursuant to
_Section 1.10_ ) to be issued upon surrender thereof until the holders of
record shall surrender such certificates. Subject to applicable Legal
Requirements, following surrender of any such Company Ordinary Share
Certificates, Holdco shall promptly deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, the Meten Merger Consideration (including any Contingent
Shares, if and when issued and to the extent the related holder is entitled
to receive such Contingent Shares pursuant to _Section 1.10_ ) issued
in exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the First Effective Time paid with
respect to such Meten Merger Consideration (including any Contingent Shares,
if and when issued and to the extent the related holder is entitled to
receive such Contingent Shares pursuant to _Section 1.10_ ).

(c)  _Transfers of Ownership_. If Meten Merger Consideration is to be issued
in a name other than that in which the Company Ordinary Share Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Company Ordinary Share Certificates so surrendered
will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Holdco or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
issuance of the Meten Merger Consideration (including any Contingent Shares,
if and when issued and to the extent the related holder is entitled to
receive such Contingent Shares pursuant to _Section 1.10_ ) in any name other
than that of the registered holder of the Company Ordinary Share Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Holdco or any agent
designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d)  _Required Withholding_. Holdco shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
(or cause to be deducted and withheld) from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. Holdco shall provide notice of any withholding that it intends
to make (or cause to be made) in connection with consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement (other than any withholding
required in connection with amounts properly treated as compensation for
applicable Tax purposes) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the
relevant payment, and the Parties shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to)
cooperate to minimize or eliminate any potential withholding. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld consistent with the terms of this
_Section 1.4(d)_ , such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  



  

(e)  _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Ordinary Shares_. All Holdco
Shares issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company
Ordinary Shares and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Cayman Islands Company of the Company Ordinary
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time.
If, after the First Effective Time, Company Ordinary Share Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Cayman Islands Company for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this  _Article I_.

  



  

1.5  _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any Company
Ordinary Share Certificates shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed,
Holdco shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Company
Ordinary Share Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof, the aggregate Meten Merger Consideration (including any
Contingent Shares, if and when issued and to the extent the related holder is
entitled to receive such Contingent Shares pursuant to _Section 1.10_ ) into
which the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented by such Company
Ordinary Share Certificates was converted into and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)_ ; provided, however, that,
as a condition precedent to the delivery of such Meten Merger Consideration,
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Ordinary Share
Certificates shall indemnify Holdco against any claim that may be made
against Holdco or the other Parties with respect to the Company
Ordinary Share Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed
and deliver any Letter of Transmittal reasonably required by Holdco.

1.6  _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Mergers together will be treated as an integrated exchange governed by
Section 351 of the Code.

  



  

1.7  _Adjustments to Meten Merger Consideration/Rollover ESOP Shares_. The
number of (i) Holdco Shares issuable as Meten Merger Consideration, and (ii)
the Rollover ESOP Shares, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately
the effect of any share split, reverse share split, share dividend (including
any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Holdco
Shares), extraordinary cash dividends, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to shares of Holdco Shares occurring on or after the date hereof but
at or prior to the First Effective Time (or, as it relates to the Contingent
Shares, prior to the date of issuance of such shares in accordance with
_Section 1.10_ ).

  



  

1.8  _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Holdco Share will be issued by
virtue of the Meten Merger, and each Person who would otherwise be entitled
to a fraction of a Holdco Share any time Holdco Shares are distributed to any
such Person pursuant to this Agreement (after aggregating all fractional
Holdco Shares that otherwise would be received by such Person in connection
with such distribution) shall, upon compliance with _Section 1.4_ , receive
from Holdco, in lieu of such fractional share, one (1) Holdco Share.

  



  

1.9  _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
First Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Surviving Cayman Islands
Company with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and Meten Merger
Sub, the officers and directors of the Company, Holdco and Meten Merger Sub
will take all such lawful and necessary action.

  



  

1.10  _Contingent Shares_.

  



  

(a) The Company Shareholders who continue to hold any of the Meten Merger
Shares on the date that one of the following conditions are met (each such
eligible Company Shareholder, an " _Eligible Company Shareholder_ ", condition
an " _Earnout Condition_ " and such date the " _Measurement Date_ ") shall be
issued their pro rata portion of the Contingent Shares (as determined in
accordance with subsection (b) below) for such Earnout Condition:

  



  

(i) If the reported closing sale price of the Holdco Shares equals or exceeds
$12.50 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends,
reorganizations, recapitalizations, or other similar actions) for any twenty
(20) trading days in a consecutive thirty (30) trading day period at any time
before December 31, 2022, the Eligible Company Shareholders shall be issued an
additional 4,000,000 Contingent Shares.

  



  

(ii) If the reported closing sale price of the Holdco Shares equals or
exceeds $15.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends,
reorganizations, recapitalizations, or other similar actions) for any twenty
(20) trading days in a consecutive thirty (30) trading day period during the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the Eligible Company Shareholders shall
be issued an additional 7,000,000 Contingent Shares.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(b) As used in this _Section 1.10_ , an Eligible Company Shareholder's "pro
rata portion" of Contingent Shares shall be determined by multiplying the
Contingent Shares earned on the Measurement Date by the _quotient_ of (i) the
number of Meten Merger Shares held by such Person on the Measurement Date
_divided by_ (ii) the total number of Meten Merger Shares held by all
Eligible Company Shareholders on the Measurement Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, if a Company Shareholder does not hold any Meten Merger Shares on the
Measurement Date, such Company Shareholder shall not be entitled to receive
any Contingent Shares.

  



  

(c) Contingent Shares shall be issued within five (5) Business Days after the
Earnout Condition has been satisfied, with no action being required on the
part of the Eligible Company Shareholders. At all times while Contingent
Shares are earnable, Holdco shall keep available for issuance a sufficient
number of unissued Holdco Shares to permit Holdco to satisfy its issuance
obligations set forth in this _Section 1.10_ and shall take all actions
required to increase the authorized number of Holdco Shares if at any time
there shall be insufficient authorized unissued shares to permit such
reservation.

  



  

1.11  _EdtechX Committee; Company Representative_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors of EdtechX shall appoint a
committee (" _EdtechX Committee_ ") consisting of one or more of its then
members to act on behalf of Holdco to take all necessary actions and make all
decisions with respect to matters related to the Mergers as may be required
after the Closing Date. In the event of a vacancy in the EdtechX
Committee, the board of directors of EdtechX, or after the consummation of
the Mergers, a majority of those Persons who served on EdtechX's board of
directors immediately prior to the Closing Date, shall appoint as a successor
some other Person who would qualify as an "independent" director of EdtechX
and who has not had any relationship with the Company prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) The Company has designated Yupeng Guo as the initial representative (the
" _Company Representative_ ") to represent the interests of the Company
Shareholders for purposes of approving amendments to this Agreement after the
date hereof, giving waivers, consents and approvals hereunder and thereunder,
and making those determinations hereunder and thereunder that are
specifically reserved to the Company Representative by the terms hereof and
thereof. If such Person ceases to serve in such capacity, for any reason, the
Company (or, following the Closing, those members of the board of directors of
Holdco who were members of the board of directors of the Company prior to the
Closing) shall appoint its successor. The Company Representative shall (i)
have no liability to Holdco, EdtechX, the Company, any Subsidiary or
Affiliate of the foregoing or any equityholder of any of the foregoing
(including any Company Shareholder) with respect to actions taken or omitted
to be taken in its capacity as the Company Representative, except as agreed
to by the Company Shareholders in the Letter of Transmittal, and (ii) be
entitled to indemnification by Holdco against any loss, liability, or
expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity
as the Company Representative (except as agreed to by the Company
Shareholders in the Letter of Transmittal).

Agreement, the Sponsors and Company Shareholders identified on _Schedule
1.12_ attached hereto (such Company Shareholders, the " _Supporting
Shareholders_ ") have entered into voting and support agreements with Holdco
and EdtechX, substantially in the form annexed hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the "
_Support Agreements_ "), pursuant to which each of the Sponsors and Supporting
Shareholders has agreed, among other things, to vote all of the EdtechX
Common Stock or Company Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by such Person in
favor of the Mergers (which vote may be taken by executing a written consent
as provided for in _Section 7.16_ hereof).

  



  

Article II _ 
  
 THE EDTECHX MERGER_

  



  

2.1  _The EdtechX Merger_. Immediately after the First Effective Time, and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Corporate Law, EdtechX Merger Sub will merge with
and into EdtechX, the separate corporate existence of EdtechX Merger Sub
shall cease, and EdtechX shall continue as the Surviving Delaware Corporation
after the EdtechX Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdco. The
EdtechX Merger will be consummated immediately upon the filing of a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such other time as may be agreed by EdtechX and the Company in writing and
specified in such filings (the " _Second Effective Time_ "). The effect of the
EdtechX Merger will be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of
Merger, and the applicable provisions of the Corporate Law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Second Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, debts,
liabilities, and duties of EdtechX and EdtechX Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Delaware Corporation.

  



  

2.2  _Governing Documents_. At the Second Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of EdtechX Merger Sub shall become the Certificate
of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Delaware Corporation, except that
the name of the Surviving Delaware Corporation shall be EdtechX Holdings
Acquisition Corp.

  



  

2.3  _Effect on EdtechX Securities_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the EdtechX Merger
and this Agreement and without any further action on the part of the Parties
or the holders of any of the securities of EdtechX, the following shall
occur:

  



  

(a)  _Conversion of EdtechX Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock of
EdtechX, par value $0.0001 per share (" _EdtechX Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time will be
automatically converted, at the Second Effective Time, into the right to
receive one Holdco Share (the " _Exchange Shares_ "), and the holders of
EdtechX Common Stock (" _EdtechX Stockholders_ ") shall cease to have any
further rights as EdtechX Stockholders. Each certificate that evidenced
shares of EdtechX Common Stock immediately prior to the EdtechX Merger ("
_EdtechX Common Stock Certificate_ ") shall entitle the holder to the
applicable number of Holdco Shares into which the EdtechX Common Stock
Certificate is convertible according to this _Section 2.3(a)_; provided,
however, that each EdtechX Common Stock Certificate owned by EdtechX
Stockholders who have validly elected to receive a portion of the proceeds
held in EdtechX's Trust Fund (each, a " _Converting Stockholder_ ") shall
entitle the Converting Stockholder to receive only such portion of the Trust
Fund as provided for in EdtechX's Charter Documents.

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(b)  _Conversion of EdtechX Warrants_. Each EdtechX Warrant issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain
outstanding immediately following the Second Effective Time but shall be
deemed to have been converted and to represent a warrant (" _Holdco Warrant_
") to purchase one Holdco Share on the same terms existing under the EdtechX
Warrants immediately prior to the Second Effective Time.

  



  

(c)  _Conversion of UPOs_. Each unit purchase option of EdtechX (" _EdtechX
UPOs_ " and together with the EdtechX Common Stock and EdtechX Warrants, the
" _EdtechX Securities_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding immediately following the
Second Effective Time but shall be deemed to have been converted and to
represent a unit purchase option (" _Holdco UPOs_ ") to purchase units of
Holdco, with each such unit consisting of one Holdco Share and one Holdco
Warrant, on the same terms existing under the EdtechX UPOs immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  _Cancellation of Treasury and Company-Owned Securities_. Each share of
EdtechX Common Stock, EdtechX Warrant and EdtechX UPO held by EdtechX or the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary thereof immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

  



  

(e)  _No Further Ownership Rights in EdtechX Common Stock_. All Holdco Shares
issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the EdtechX Common
Stock and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Delaware Corporation of the shares of EdtechX Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time. If,
after the Second Effective Time, EdtechX Common Stock Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Delaware Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

  



  

2.4  _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the
Mergers together will be treated as an integrated exchange governed by
Section 351 of the Code.

  



  

2.5  _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Second Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Surviving Delaware Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers, and franchises of EdtechX, the officers and directors of
EdtechX, Holdco, and EdtechX Merger Sub will take all such lawful and
necessary action.

  



  

2.6  _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, the Parties
shall cause the Mergers to be consummated by filing (i) the Plan of Merger
with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies with respect to the Meten
Merger and (ii) the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware with respect to the EdtechX Merger (collectively, the "
_Merger Documents_ "). Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , the consummation of the Mergers (the " _Closing_
"), other than the filing of the Merger Documents, shall take place at the
offices of Graubard Miller, counsel to EdtechX, The Chrysler Building, 405
Lexington Avenue, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10174-1901 at a time and date
to be specified by EdtechX and the Company, which shall be no later than the
fifth (5th) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_ , or at such other time, date and location as
EdtechX and the Company hereto agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

2.7  _FIRPTA_. Upon the Closing, EdtechX shall deliver to Holdco a properly
prepared statement certifying to the effect that EdtechX is not a "United
States real property holding corporation" together with a notice to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service, each prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h)(2) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_.

Subject to the exceptions set forth in _Schedule 3_ attached hereto (the "

as follows:

  



  

3.1  _Organization and Qualification_.

  



  

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the Cayman Islands and has the requisite corporate
power and authority to own, lease, and operate its assets and properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is in
possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of or from any
Governmental Entity (" _Approvals_ ") necessary to own, lease, and operate
the properties it purports to own, operate, or lease and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Complete and correct copies
of the memorandum and articles of association (or other comparable governing
instruments with different names) (collectively referred to herein as "
_Charter Documents_ ") of the Company, as amended and currently in effect,
have been made available to EdtechX or EdtechX's counsel.

  



  

(b) The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased, or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

3.2  _Subsidiaries_.

  



  

(a) The Company has no direct or indirect subsidiaries other than those
listed in _Schedule 3.2_ (the " _Subsidiaries_ "). Except as set forth in
_Schedule 3.2_ , the Company owns all of the outstanding equity securities of
the Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens,
either directly or indirectly through one or more other Subsidiaries.
Except with respect to the Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly
or indirectly, any equity or voting interest in any Person and does not have
any agreement or commitment to purchase any such interest, and has not agreed
and is not obligated to make nor is bound by any written or oral agreement,
contract, subcontract, lease, binding understanding, instrument, note, option,
warranty, purchase order, license, sublicense, insurance policy, benefit

may hereafter be in effect, under which it may become obligated to make any
future investment in or capital contribution to any other entity.

now being conducted. Each Subsidiary is in possession of all Approvals
necessary to own, lease, and operate the properties it purports to own,
operate, or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Complete and correct copies of the Charter Documents of each
Subsidiary, as amended and currently in effect, have been made available to
EdtechX or EdtechX's counsel.

  



  

(c) Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation or foreign limited liability company and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased, or
operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

  



  

3.3  _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 500,000,000
Company Ordinary Shares. _Schedule 3.3(a)_ hereto contains a list of all of

upon the exercise of Company Convertible Securities, upon issuance on the

(c) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3(b)_ or _Schedule 3.3(c)_ hereto or
as set forth in _Section 3.3(a)_ hereof, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, equity securities, or other

(d)  _Schedule 3.3(d)_ sets forth all outstanding bonds, debentures, notes
and other debt securities of the Company. Except as set forth in _Schedule

any matter.

  



  

(e) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3(e)_ or as contemplated by this
Agreement, there are no registration rights, and there is no voting trust,

3.4  _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. The Company has all necessary
corporate power and authority to: (i) execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and each ancillary document that the Company has executed or
delivered or is to execute or deliver pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii)
carry out the Company's obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including the Meten
Merger). The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Meten Merger) have been, or will be, duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (including the approval
by its board of directors and, prior to the Closing, its shareholders as
required by the Corporate Law), and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. The affirmative vote of the Supporting
Shareholders to approve this Agreement, the Meten Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be sufficient to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution, and delivery thereof by the other Parties, constitutes the legal
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

  



  

3.5  _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 3.5_ hereto:

  



  

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company shall not, (i) conflict with
or violate the Charter Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) conflict with or violate any Legal Requirements, (iii) result in any
breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or impair the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' rights or alter the rights or obligations of any third
party under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any
of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than Permitted Liens) pursuant to, any Material Company Contracts, or (iv)
result in the triggering, acceleration or increase of any payment to any
Person pursuant to any Company Contract, including any "change in control" or
similar provision of any Company Contract; _except_ , with respect to clauses
(ii), (iii) and (iv), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,
impairments, alterations, triggerings, accelerations, increases or other
occurrences that would not, individually and in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of its obligations hereunder will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
_Governmental Entity or other third party (including, without limitation,
lenders and lessors)_ , except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (" _Securities Act_ "), the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (" _Exchange Act_ "), or state securities
laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and appropriate documents
received from or filed with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions
in which the Company is licensed or qualified to do business, (ii) for the
filing of any notifications required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and the expiration
of the required waiting period thereunder, (iii) the consents, approvals,
authorizations, and permits described in _Schedule 3.5(b)_ , and (iv) where
the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations, or permits,
or to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company or, after the Closing, Holdco, or (y) prevent the consummation of
the Mergers or otherwise prevent the Company from performing its obligations
under this Agreement on a timely basis.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

3.6  _Compliance_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.6_ , during the
preceding three (3) years, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has
complied with all, and is not in violation of any, Legal Requirements with
respect to the conduct of its business, or the ownership or operation of its
business, except for failures to comply or violations which, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The businesses and activities of the
Company and of each of its Subsidiaries, during the preceding three (3) years,
have not been and are not being conducted in violation of any Legal
Requirements, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or
has been during the preceding three (3) years, in default or violation of any
term, condition or provision of any applicable Charter Documents, except for
any default or violation which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.6_ , within the past year, no
written notice of material non-compliance with any Legal Requirements has been
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any Governmental
Authority (and the Company has no knowledge of any such notice delivered to
any other Person).

  



  

3.7  _Permits_. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.7, the Company and each
Subsidiary hold all material permits necessary to lawfully conduct their
respective business as presently conducted and as currently contemplated to be
conducted, and to own, lease and operate its assets and properties
(collectively, the " _Permits_ "), and all such Permits are in full force
and effect, and no suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened, except for any failure to
hold such Permit or the suspension or cancellation of such Permit which,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is in material violation of the terms of any Permit,
except where such violation would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To
the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred and is continuing which
requires or permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would require or
permit, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any ancillary documents will not require or permit (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both), any modification or termination of any such
Permits, except where such modification or termination would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. To the knowledge of the Company, no
Governmental Action/Filing is necessary to be obtained, secured or made by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enable any of them to continue to
conduct its businesses and operations and use its properties after the
Closing in a manner which is substantially consistent in all material respects
with current practice, except where such failures to obtain such Governmental
Action/Filing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, Holdco, and the
Merger Subs, constitutes the legal and binding obligation of
EdtechX, enforceable against EdtechX in accordance with its terms, except as

not and shall not: (i) conflict with or violate any of its Charter Documents,
(ii) conflict with or violate any Legal Requirements, or (iii) result in any
breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair any of

give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the properties

occurrences that would not, individually and in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on EdtechX.

  



  

   

27

 



    



  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by EdtechX do not, and the
performance of their respective obligations hereunder will not, require any

documents with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in which
EdtechX is qualified to do business, (ii) for the filing of any notifications
required under the HSR Act and the expiration of the required waiting period
thereunder, (iii) the qualification of the Surviving Delaware Corporation and
Surviving Cayman Islands Company as a foreign corporation in those
jurisdictions in which the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
makes such qualification necessary, and (iv) where the failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to (x) have a Material Adverse Effect on EdtechX or, after the
Closing, Holdco, or (y) prevent the consummation of the Mergers or otherwise
prevent EdtechX from performing its material obligations under this Agreement
on a timely basis.

  



  

4.6  _Compliance_. EdtechX has complied with all, and is not in violation of

businesses and activities of EdtechX have not been and are not being
conducted in violation of any Legal Requirements, except for

SEC since its formation (collectively, as they have been amended since the
time of their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the " _EdtechX SEC
Reports_ "). None of the EdtechX SEC Reports, as of their respective
dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
EdtechX SEC Reports were prepared in all material respects in accordance with
the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The
audited financial statements of EdtechX (" _EdtechX Audited Financial
Statements_ ") and unaudited interim financial statements of EdtechX ("
_EdtechX Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and, together with the EdtechX
Audited Financial Statements, the " _EdtechX Financial Statements_
") (including, in each case, the notes and schedules thereto) included in the
EdtechX SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared
in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis in accordance with
past practice during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited
statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present (subject,
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements included therein, to
normal year-end adjustments and the absence of complete footnotes) in all
material respects the financial position of EdtechX as of the respective dates
thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the respective
periods then ended.

principal financial officer, particularly during the periods in which
the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. To
EdtechX's knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting EdtechX's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer to material information required to be included in EdtechX's periodic
reports required under the Exchange Act.

off or counterclaim to which EdtechX has been notified in writing as of the
date hereof except to the extent set forth in such balance sheet contained

the related notes to EdtechX Financial Statements that are, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the business, results of operations or financial

or any options, warrants, calls or rights to acquire any such shares or other
securities, (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any of
EdtechX's capital stock, (iv) any granting by EdtechX of any increase in
compensation or fringe benefits, or any payment by EdtechX of any bonus, or
any granting by EdtechX of any increase in severance or termination pay or

termination or indemnification agreement or any agreement the benefits of
which are contingent or the terms of which are materially altered upon the
occurrence of a transaction involving EdtechX of the nature contemplated
hereby, (v) entry by EdtechX into any licensing or other agreement with regard
to the acquisition or disposition of any material Intellectual Property other

actions or proceedings pending or to EdtechX's knowledge, threatened against
EdtechX before any court, governmental department, commission, agency,

suits, actions or proceedings would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on EdtechX.

  



  

4.11  _Employee Benefit Plans_. EdtechX does not maintain, and has no
liability under, any Plan, and neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation,
golden parachute, bonus, or otherwise) becoming due to any stockholder,
director, or employee of EdtechX, or (ii) result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

indentures, notes, bonds, Liens, license, permit, franchise, purchase orders,
sales orders or other understandings, commitments or obligations (including
without limitation outstanding offers or proposals) of any kind, whether
written or oral, to which EdtechX is a party or by or to which any of the
properties or assets of EdtechX may be bound, subject or affected, which may
not be cancelled without penalty or liability by EdtechX on less than 30

EdtechX SEC Reports.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth in the EdtechX SEC Reports, each EdtechX Contract was
entered into at arms' length and in the ordinary course, is in full force and
effect, and is valid and binding upon and enforceable against each of the
parties thereto, except insofar as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally or by principles governing the
availability of equitable remedies. True, correct, and complete copies of all
EdtechX Contracts (or written summaries in the case of oral EdtechX Contracts)
have been made available to the Company or Company counsel.

notice or lapse of time or both would become a breach of or default under, any
EdtechX Contract, and no party to any EdtechX Contract has given any written
notice of any claim of any such breach, default or event, which, individually
or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on EdtechX. Each EdtechX Contract that has not expired by its terms is in
full force and effect, except where such failure to be in full force and
effect is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on EdtechX.

  



  

4.20  _Insurance_. Except for directors' and officers' liability insurance,
EdtechX does not maintain any Insurance Policy.

  



  

4.21  _Interested Party Transactions_. (a) No employee, officer, director, or

expenses incurred on behalf of EdtechX; and (b) to EdtechX's knowledge, no
employee, officer, director, or stockholder or any member of his or her
immediate family is, directly or indirectly, interested in any material
contract with EdtechX (other than such contracts as relate to the acquisition
of such stockholder's ownership of capital stock or other securities).

least 80% of the balance in the Trust Fund (excluding taxes payable).

Fund shall be utilized in accordance with _Section 7.12_ hereof.

  



  

4.25  _Registration Statement_. None of the information relating to EdtechX

EdtechX Stockholders, at the time of the Special Meeting, or on the Closing
Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

4.26  _Backstop_. EdtechX has entered into a Forward Purchase Contract (the "
_Azimut FPC_ ") with Azimut Enterprises Holdings S.r.l. ("Azimut") and the
other parties thereto on July 18, 2018, pursuant to which Azimut will
purchase up to an aggregate of $20,000,000 of EdtechX units at $10.00 per
unit, with each unit containing one share of EdtechX Common Stock and one
EdtechX Warrant. EdtechX has also signed a letter agreement dated as of
December 12, 2019 (the " _Azimut Consent_ ") with Azimut and other parties
thereto, pursuant to which Azimut has given its irrevocable consent under
Section 4.3.4 of the Azimut FPC, among other things. The Azimut FPC and the
Azimut Consent have been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered
by EdtechX, constitute the legal and binding obligation of EdtechX,
enforceable against EdtechX in accordance with their terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity. The exact number of EdtechX units to be purchased by
Azimut pursuant to the Azimut FPC will be notified by EdtechX no later than
four (4) Business Days prior to the closing of the Azimut FPC (the "

Subsidiaries makes such qualification necessary, and (iv) where the failure

6.2  _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.

  



  

(a)  _Confidentiality_. That certain Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated as of
August 12, 2019 shall terminate as of the date hereof and the confidentiality
of information exchanged in connection with this Agreement and the
negotiations related thereto will be governed by the terms of this _Section
6.2_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that it has or will receive
Confidential Information concerning the other Parties (the recipient of such
information is referred to in this _Section 6.2_ as the " _Recipient_ " and
the Party disclosing such information is referred to as the " _Disclosing
Party_ "). The Recipient shall keep the Confidential Information strictly
confidential and shall not use the Confidential Information for any purpose
other than to evaluate, negotiate, and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Recipient shall not disclose or
permit its Representatives to disclose any Confidential Information without
prior written consent of the Disclosing Party except: (i) if required by
applicable Legal Requirements, and in such case the Recipient shall (x) take
all reasonable steps to preserve the privileged nature and confidentiality of
the Confidential Information, including requesting that the Confidential
Information not be disclosed to non-parties or the public, and furnishing
only that portion of the Confidential Information which, on the advice of the
Recipient's counsel, is legally required to be disclosed, (y) give the
Disclosing Party prompt prior written notice of such request or requirement
so that the Disclosing Party may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an
appropriate protective order or other remedy, and (z) cooperate with the
Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, to obtain
such protective order; or (ii) to its Representatives, to the extent necessary
to permit such Representatives to assist the Recipient in evaluating,
negotiating, and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, that the Recipient shall require each such Representative to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
were parties hereto. Except for such disclosure as may be required or
permitted by this Agreement, the Recipient shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Representatives to, without the prior written consent of the
Disclosing Party, disclose the fact that Confidential Information has been
made available to the Recipient or its Representatives, or the existence or
contents of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach
of this _Section 6.2_ by any of its Representatives. As used herein, "
_Confidential Information_ " means all information, data, documents,
agreements, files, and other materials, whether disclosed orally or disclosed
or stored in written, electronic, or other form or media, which is obtained
from or disclosed by the Disclosing Party, its Representatives, or otherwise,
and whether obtained before or on or after the date hereof, including without
limitation, all notes, analyses, compilations, reports, forecasts, studies,
samples, and other documents prepared by or for the Recipient which contain
or otherwise reflect or are derived or based in whole or in part on such
information, data, documents, agreements, files, or other materials. The term
"Confidential Information" as used herein does not include information that at
the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to and known by
the public (other than as a result of its disclosure directly or indirectly
by the Recipient or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement). If
this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
provisions of this _Section 6.2(a)_ shall continue in full force and effect,
subject to _Section 9.2(b)_ hereof.

  



  

   

43

 



    



  

(b)  _Access to Information_.

  



  

(i) Subject to confidentiality obligations and similar restrictions that may
be applicable to information furnished to the Company or its Subsidiaries by
third parties that may be in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' possession
from time to time, and except for any information which in the opinion of
legal counsel of the Company would result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege or other privilege from disclosure, the Company will afford
EdtechX and its financial advisors, accountants, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, in such manner as to not interfere with the normal
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the properties, books,
records and management personnel of the Company during the period prior to
the Closing to obtain all information concerning the business, including the
status of business development efforts, properties, results of operations and
personnel of the Company, as EdtechX may reasonably request; provided, that
such access shall not include any invasive or intrusive investigations or
other testing, sampling or analysis of any properties, facilities or
equipment of the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent
of the Company. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
alternative arrangements for such disclosure where the restrictions in the
preceding sentence apply. No information or knowledge obtained by EdtechX in
any investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.2(b)(i)_  will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Mergers.

  



  

(ii) Subject to confidentiality obligations and similar restrictions that may
be applicable to information furnished to EdtechX by third parties that may
be in EdtechX's possession from time to time, and except for any information
which in the opinion of legal counsel of EdtechX would result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege or other privilege from disclosure, EdtechX will
afford the Company and its financial advisors, underwriters, accountants,
counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, in such manner as to not interfere with the
normal operation of EdtechX, to the properties, books, records and personnel
of EdtechX during the period prior to the Closing to obtain all information
concerning the business, including properties, results of operations and
personnel, as the Company may reasonably request. The Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make alternative arrangements for such
disclosure where the restrictions in the preceding sentence apply. No
information or knowledge obtained by the Company in any investigation pursuant
to this _Section 6.2(b)(ii) _ will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Mergers.

6.3  _Exclusivity_. During the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
its terms or the Closing, except as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) each
of the Company, Holdco and the Merger Subs will not, and will cause its
respective Affiliates, employees, agents, officers, directors and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or enter into
discussions or transactions with, or encourage, or provide any
information to, any corporation, partnership or other entity or group (other
than EdtechX and its designees) concerning any merger, sale of ownership
interests in the Company and/or a material portion of the assets of the
Company (other than immaterial assets or assets sold in the ordinary course
of business), or a recapitalization or similar transaction involving the
Company and (b) EdtechX will not, and will cause its Affiliates, employees,
agents, officers, directors and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, solicit or enter into discussions or transactions with, or
encourage, or provide any information to, any corporation, partnership or
other entity or group (other than the Company and its designees) concerning
any merger, purchase of ownership interests and/or assets, recapitalization
or similar business combination transaction. In addition, (i) each of the
Company, Holdco, and the Merger Subs will, and will cause its respective
Affiliates, employees, agents, officers, directors and representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any alternative merger, sale of
ownership interests in and/or a material portion of the assets of the Company
(other than immaterial assets or assets sold in the ordinary course of
business) or recapitalization or similar transaction involving the Company,
Holdco and the Merger Subs and (ii) EdtechX will, and will cause its
Affiliates, employees, agents, officers, directors and representatives to,
immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any alternative merger, purchase
of ownership interests and/or assets, recapitalization or similar business
combination transaction. Each of the Company and EdtechX will promptly notify
the other if it receives, or if any of its or its Affiliates' employees,
agents, officers, directors or representatives receives any proposal, offer
or submission with respect to a competing transaction after the date of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Company and EdtechX may
respond to any such proposal, offer or submission by indicating only that it
is subject to an exclusivity agreement and is unable to provide any
information related to the Company and its Subsidiaries or EdtechX, as the
case may be, or entertain any proposals or offers or engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning a competing transaction for as long as
that exclusivity agreement remains in effect. The Parties agree that the
rights and remedies for noncompliance with this _Section 6.3_ include
specific performance, it being acknowledged and agreed that any breach or
threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching Party and
that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy for such injury.

  



  

6.4  _Certain Financial Information_. Within seventy-five (75) days after the
end of each financial quarter between the date hereof and the earlier of the
Closing Date and the date on which this Agreement is terminated, the Company

quarter, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis
in accordance with past practice.

  



  

6.5  _Access to Financial Information_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms or the Closing, each of the Company and
EdtechX will, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its

continue to provide each other and each other's advisors reasonable access to
all of the financial information used in the preparation of its financial
statements and financial information and (b) reasonably cooperate with any
reviews performed by each other or each other's advisors of any such
financial statements or such financial information.

conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,

following: (i) the taking of such reasonable acts necessary to cause the

obtaining of such reasonably necessary actions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of such

and the taking of such reasonable steps as may be reasonably necessary to
avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of such material consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties required as a result of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, including the consents referred to in
_Schedule 3.5,_ (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,

execution or delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
(x) nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require EdtechX or the
Company to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or
the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to
conduct their business or to own or exercise control of such assets,
properties and stock and (y) in no event shall EdtechX, Holdco, the Merger
Subs, the Company or its Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any expense or pay
any fee or grant any concession in connection with obtaining any consents,
authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of any Company Contract in
connection with the consummation of the Mergers.

it has read EdtechX's final prospectus dated October 5, 2018 (" _Final
Prospectus_ ") and understands that EdtechX has established the Trust Fund
for the benefit of EdtechX's public stockholders and that EdtechX may
disburse monies from the Trust Fund only (a) to EdtechX's public stockholders
in the event they elect to convert their shares into cash in accordance with
EdtechX's Charter Documents and/or the liquidation of EdtechX or (b) to
EdtechX after, or concurrently with, the consummation of a business

date as shall be set forth in an amendment to EdtechX's Charter Documents for
the purpose of extending the date by which EdtechX must complete a business
combination, EdtechX will be obligated to return to its stockholders the

and the Merger Subs, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives
all rights, title, interest or claim of any kind against EdtechX to collect
from the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed to them by EdtechX for any
reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of this Agreement by

set forth in _Section 7.15_  (assuming, solely for purposes of such
determination, that all grants with respect to Holdco equity made pursuant to
such incentive equity plan will be considered made in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby).

(b)  _Defense_. The Company Representative or the EdtechX Committee, as
applicable, shall have the right, at its option (subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 10.3(c)_ below) and at its own expense, by written
notice to EdtechX Committee or Company Representative, as applicable, within
twenty (20) days of receipt of a Notice of Claim, to assume the entire control
of, subject to the right of EdtechX Committee or Company Representative, as
applicable, to participate (at its expense and with counsel of its choice)
in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as to which
such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint a
recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the EdtechX
Committee or the Company Representative, as applicable, to be the lead
counsel in connection with such defense. If the Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee, as applicable, is permitted and elects to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim:

  



  

(i) such Person shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third Party
Claim and shall keep the EdtechX Committee or Company Representative, as
applicable, reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided,
however, that the EdtechX Committee or Company Representative, as applicable,
shall have the right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and

  



  

(ii) the EdtechX Committee and any EdtechX Indemnitee that is the subject of
the Third Party Claim, or the Company Representative and any Company
Indemnitee that is the subject of the Third Party Claim, as applicable, shall
cooperate fully in all respects with the Company Representative or EdtechX
Committee, as applicable, in any such defense, compromise or settlement
thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, such
Persons shall make available to the Company Representative or EdtechX
Committee, as applicable, all pertinent information and documents under its
control.

  



  

(c)  _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee, as applicable, shall not be entitled to assume control of
such defense if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection
with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation, or
investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against an EdtechX Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee, as applicable; or
(iii) there is a reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim
may materially and adversely affect the EdtechX Indemnitee or the Company
Indemnitee, as applicable, other than as a result of money damages or other
money payments.

  



  

(d)  _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to
provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any
Third Party Claim by the Company Representative or EdtechX Committee, as
applicable, and shall not affect such Person's duty or obligations under this
_Article X_ , except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure
shall have adversely affected the ability of such Person to defend against or
reduce its liability or caused or increased such liability or otherwise caused
the damages for which such Person is obligated to be greater than such
damages would have been had EdtechX Committee or Company Representative, as
applicable, prompt notice hereunder. So long as the Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee, as applicable, is defending any such action actively and
in good faith, the EdtechX Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee, as applicable,
shall not settle such action. The Surviving Delaware Corporation shall make
available to the Company Representative all relevant records and other
relevant materials required by the Company Representative and in the
possession or under the control of the Surviving Delaware Corporation, for the
use of the Company Representative and its representatives in defending any
such action, and shall in other respects give reasonable cooperation in such
defense, and the Surviving Cayman Islands Company shall make available to the
EdtechX Committee all relevant records and other relevant materials required
by the EdtechX Committee and in the possession or under the control of the
Surviving Cayman Islands Company, for the use of the EdtechX Committee and
its representatives in defending any such action, and shall in other respects
give reasonable cooperation in such defense.

(e)  _Failure to Defend_. If the Company Representative or EdtechX Committee,
promptly after receiving a Notice of Claim, fails to defend such Third Party
Claim actively and in good faith, EdtechX Committee or the Company
Representative, as applicable, will (upon further written notice) have the
right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party
Claim as it may determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the
Company Representative or EdtechX Committee, as applicable, shall have the
right to approve any settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f)  _Indemnitee Rights_. Anything in this _Section 10.3_ to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Company Representative shall not, without the
written consent of the EdtechX Committee, settle or compromise any action or
consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to each
of the EdtechX Indemnitees of a full and unconditional release from all
liability and obligation in respect of such action without any payment by any
EdtechX Indemnitee and (ii) the EdtechX Committee shall not, without the
written consent of the Company Representative, settle or compromise any
action or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to
each of the Company Indemnitees of a full and unconditional release from all
liability and obligation in respect of such action without any payment by any
Company Indemnitee.

  



  

10.4  _Indemnification of Direct Claims_. Any action on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be asserted by EdtechX Committee by giving the Company Representative a Notice
of Claim, or by Company Representative by giving the EdtechX Committee a
Notice of Claim, each in accordance with _Section 10.3(a)_
(substituting "Direct Claim" for "Third Party Claim" as applicable). Failure
to give prompt Notice of Claim or to provide copies of relevant available
documents or to furnish relevant available data shall not constitute a defense
(in whole or in part) to any Direct Claim and shall not affect the Company
Representative's or EdtechX Committee's duty or obligations under this
_Article X_ , except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure
shall have adversely affected the ability of the Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee to defend against or reduce its liability or caused or
increased such liability or otherwise caused the damages for which the
Company Representative or EdtechX Committee is obligated to be greater than
such damages would have been had such Person given prompt notice hereunder.
The Company Representative and its representatives and advisors, or the
EdtechX Committee and its representatives and advisors, as applicable, shall
have twenty (20) calendar days after its receipt of the Notice of Claim to
investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct
Claim, and the Surviving Delaware Corporation and the EdtechX Committee or
the Surviving Cayman Islands Company and Company Representative,
as applicable, shall reasonably assist such investigation by giving such
information and access to persons or records as the Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee may reasonably request. If the Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee, as applicable, does not respond to the Notice of Claim
within such twenty (20) calendar day period, the Company Representative or
EdtechX Committee shall be deemed to have accepted the Direct Claim. If
Company Representative or EdtechX Committee rejects the Direct Claim,
it shall, within such twenty (20) calendar day period, notify the EdtechX
Committee or Company Representative, as applicable, in writing of its
rejection, specifying the factual or legal basis therefor, and the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Direct Claim. If the parties are
unable to reach an agreement within ten (10) calendar days after EdtechX
Committee's or Company Representative's receipt of such rejection notice,
EdtechX Committee or Company Representative shall be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the EdtechX Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee,
as applicable, with respect to the Direct Claim, on the terms and subject to
the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

10.5  _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ are recoverable pursuant to
contractual indemnification rights or other reimbursement arrangements
pursuant to an insurance policy, EdtechX Committee or Company Representative,
as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum
recovery under such insurance; provided that EdtechX Committee or Company
Representative shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for
indemnification under this _Article X_ in respect of such Losses and the time
limitations set forth in _Section 10.6 _ hereof for bringing a claim of
indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of
such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by an EdtechX Indemnitee or
Company Indemnitee for monies from an insurer or against a third party in
respect of any Loss shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the
indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to be
due and owing. If an EdtechX Indemnitee or Company Indemnitee has received the
indemnification required by this Article X in respect of any Loss and later
receives proceeds from insurance or other amounts in respect of such Loss,
then it shall hold such proceeds or other amounts in trust for the benefit of
the Company Shareholders or Holdco, as applicable, and shall pay to the
Company Shareholders or Holdco, as promptly as practicable after receipt, a
sum equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount received, up to the
aggregate amount of any indemnification received pursuant to this Article X in
respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
it is the intention of the Parties that no insurer or any other third party
shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the
absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the
responsibility to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  



  

10.6  _Limitations on Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  _Survival; Time Limitation_. The representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or in any writing delivered by the Company,
Holdco, or the Merger Subs to EdtechX or by EdtechX to the Company, Holdco, or
the Merger Subs in connection with this Agreement (including pursuant to
_Articles III_ , _IV_ , or _V_ hereof and the certificates required to be
delivered by the Company pursuant to _Sections 8.3(a)_ and _(c)_ and by
EdtechX pursuant to Sections _8.2(a)_  and _(c)_ ) shall survive the Closing
until the date falling on the first anniversary of the Closing (the "
_Survival Period_ "). Any claim set forth in a Notice of Claim sent prior to
the expiration of the Survival Period shall survive until final resolution
thereof. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, no claim
for indemnification under this _Article X_ shall be brought after the end of
the Survival Period.

  



  

(b)  _Limits on Indemnification_. In no event shall the Company Shareholders'
aggregate indemnification under this Agreement exceed three and a half
percent (3.5%) of the Meten Merger Shares. In no event shall EdtechX's
aggregate indemnification under this Agreement exceed the Indemnification
Pool.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(c)  _De Minimus Claim_. Neither an EdtechX Indemnitee nor a Company
Indemnitee may make a claim for indemnification under this  _Article X_ if
such claim has resulted in a Loss that is less than $200,000 (the " _De
Minimus Threshold_ ").

  



  

(d)  _Deductible_. No amount shall be payable under this _Article X_ unless
and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable
exceeds $5,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which case only to the extent of
such excess shall be indemnifiable, provided that only claims that have
resulted in Losses that exceed the De Minimus Threshold shall be
counted towards calculating the Deductible.

  



  

(d)  _Obligation to Mitigate Damages_. Nothing in this Agreement restricts or
limits the general obligation at law of each indemnified Person to mitigate
any Losses.

  



  

10.7  _Adjustment to Meten Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for
indemnification under Article X (either paid by the Company Shareholders or
received by the Company Shareholders) shall be deemed to be an adjustment to
the Meten Merger Consideration, except as otherwise required by law.

  



  

10.8  _Payments_.

  



  

(a) Once a Loss payable to an EdtechX Indemnitee is agreed to by the EdtechX
Committee and the Company Representative, or finally adjudicated to be
payable pursuant to this _Article X_ (the date on which the amount of Loss
under this paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) below is determined, the "
_Determination Date_ "), the Company Representative shall cause each
Company Shareholder to either (i) forfeit and return to Holdco for
cancellation such number of Holdco Shares equal to the Company
Shareholder's pro rata portion (calculated based on their pro rata portion of
Meten Merger Shares received pursuant to this Agreement) of the Loss (subject
to the aggregate limit set forth in _Section 10.6(b)_ ), with such Holdco
Shares valued at a price per share equal to the reported closing sale price
of the Holdco Shares on Nasdaq or the NYSE, as applicable, on the
Determination Date (the " _Closing Price_ "), or (ii) if a Company
Shareholder has transferred, sold, or otherwise disposed the Holdco Shares it
held, then to promptly pay to Holdco, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the dollar value of such Company Shareholder's pro rata
portion of the Loss (calculated based on their pro rata portion of Meten
Merger Shares received pursuant to this Agreement) (subject to _Section
10.6(b)_ with such Meten Merger Shares valued at the Closing Price when
applying  _Section 10.6(b)_ ). Any amount of Loss payable under this Article
X which is not satisfied within thirty (30) days shall accrue interest from
and including the Determination Date and including the date such payment has
been made at a rate equal to five percent (5%) per annum, compounding daily
on the basis of a 360 day year.

  



  

(b) Once a Loss payable to a Company Indemnitee is agreed to by EdtechX
Committee and the Company Representative, or finally adjudicated to be
payable pursuant to this Article X, Holdco shall promptly issue to the Company
Shareholders such number of Holdco Shares from the Indemnification Pool equal
to the dollar value of the Loss, with such Holdco Shares valued at a price per
share equal to the reported closing sale price of the Holdco Shares on Nasdaq
or the NYSE, as applicable, on the Determination Date. The number of Holdco
Shares each Company Shareholder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be calculated based on their pro rata portion of the
number of Meten Merger Shares received pursuant to this Agreement. Holdco
shall reserve and keep available for issuance a sufficient number of unissued
Holdco Shares to permit the issuance pursuant this _Section 10.8(b)_.

10.9  _Representative Capacity and Expenses_.

under this _Article X_ are solely as a representative of the Company
Shareholders. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Company Representative shall have no liability to the Surviving Cayman
Islands Company, or any Company Shareholder, or any Party for any action taken
or omitted to be taken hereunder, unless such liability is determined by a
judgment or a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Company Representative.
The Surviving Cayman Islands Company shall defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless the Company Representative for all losses, damages, costs, and
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and costs of investigation)
arising out of or in connection with, the performance by the Company

competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the fraud, gross negligence, or
willful misconduct of the Company Representative.

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge that all actions to be taken by the EdtechX
Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article X_ shall be taken on their behalf by
the EdtechX Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the EdtechX Committee shall have no liability to the Surviving
Delaware Corporation or any EdtechX Indemnitee, or any Party for any action
taken or omitted to be taken hereunder, unless such liability is determined
by a judgment or a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the EdtechX Committee. The
Surviving Delaware Corporation shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
EdtechX Committee for all losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and costs of investigation) arising out of or in
connection with, the performance by the EdtechX Committee of its duties and
obligations under this Agreement, unless such liability is determined by a
judgment or a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the EdtechX Committee.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company Representative nor the EdtechX Committee shall have
any personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by them in their
capacities as such and all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them shall be
borne by Holdco.

effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery by

executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the previous
sentence.

  



  

11.5  _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties and any of their
respective Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby;
and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder (except as specifically provided in this
Agreement, including _Section 7.10_ ). No representations, warranties,
covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist between the Parties except
as expressly set forth or referenced in this Agreement.

  



  

11.6  _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

11.7  _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,

remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 11.7 _ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement

76

 



    



  

11.11  _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other Parties. Subject to the first sentence of this _Section
11.11_ , this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

11.12  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time
only by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties. The approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of any Party shall
not restrict the ability of the board of directors of such Party to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1_ or to cause such Party to
enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 11.12_.

  



  

11.13  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, any party

such Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such

writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

  



  

11.14  _Currency_. All references to currency amounts in this Agreement shall
mean United States dollars.

  



  

11.15  _Schedules_. The information furnished in the Schedules is arranged in
sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement, and the disclosures
in any section of the Schedules shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (b) other Sections of this Agreement to the extent
(notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference), that it is
reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is also applicable to
such other Sections of this Agreement. The Schedules and the information and
disclosures contained in such Schedules are intended only to qualify and limit
the representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope of any such
representation or warranty. The inclusion of any information in the Schedules
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment that such information
is material or outside the ordinary course of business. The inclusion of any
fact or information in a Schedule is not intended to be construed as an
admission or concession as to the legal effect of any such fact or information
in any proceeding between any party and any Person who is not a party.
