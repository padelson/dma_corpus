any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate
remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Seller, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) To the extent any Party brings a proceeding, action or other similar process to enforce specifically the performance of the

available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such proceeding, action or other similar process or (ii) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such proceeding, action or other similar process. </P>
