entitled to receive, upon demand, only from the Surviving Entity or Parent,
payment of the Per Unit Payments to which it is entitled, and may surrender
any Company Unit Certificate or Book Entry Unit, as applicable, to the
Surviving Entity or Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property,

Unitholders Company Unit Certificates or delivers a Lost Certificate
Affidavit as provided in this _Section 3.2_.

accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Units. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Unit Certificates or Book Entry Units are presented to Parent or the
Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this _Section 3.2_.

any consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose

registered or in whose name the Book Entry Unit is registered, it shall be a

deliver all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
(accompanied by the Company Unit Certificate, if applicable) and shall pay to
the Surviving Entity any transfer or other Taxes payable by the Surviving
Entity required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Company Unit Certificate so

Parent with the right to participate in such Tax Contest, subject to Sellers

 



\- 39 -  ultimate control over such Tax Contest; and, provided further, that if any
of the issues raised in such Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have
a materially adverse impact on Taxes of the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries for a Post-Closing Tax Period, then Sellers shall not affect any
settlement or compromise of such Tax Contest without obtaining Parents prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Sellers have the right to control the conduct and
resolution of a Tax Contest but elect in writing not to do so within fifteen
(15) Business Days of receiving notice of such Tax Contest, then Parent shall
have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest;
provided, however, that Parent shall keep the Representative informed of all
developments on a timely basis and shall provide the Representative with the
right to participate in such Tax Contest, subject to Parents ultimate
control over such Tax Contest, provided, further, that Parent shall not
resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have
an adverse impact on Sellers liabilities for Taxes without the
Representatives prior written consent. Each Party shall bear its own costs
and expenses for participating in any Tax Contest.

 

(f) _Purchase Price Allocation_. No later than 30 days after the date hereof,
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Company for its review and approval
an Asset Allocation Statement allocating the purchase price (including any
assumed liabilities, as determined for Tax purposes) among the assets of the
Group Companies in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law, as appropriate). The parties shall negotiate in
good faith to reach agreement on the Asset Allocation Statement before the
Closing Date. Upon such agreement, such Asset Allocation Statement shall be
delivered to the Representative and the General Partner. In the event that the
parties cannot agree on the allocation as set forth in such Asset Allocation
Statement then none of Parent, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall
be required pursuant hereto to file any Tax Returns or information reports or
otherwise take any positions consistent with such allocation.

 

Section 6.3 _Access to Information_. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, and subject to restrictions
contained in the confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are
subject, the Company shall provide to Parent and Merger Sub and
their authorized representatives during normal business hours reasonable
access to all books and records of the Group Companies (in a manner so as to
not interfere with the normal business operations of any Group Company).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Group
Companies shall be required to provide such access or disclose any information
to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective authorized representatives, if doing
so would (i) result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or similar privilege or (ii) violate any Contract or Law to which any
Group Company is a party or to which any Group Company is subject.

 

Section 6.4 _Confidentiality Agreement_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect
and, in addition, covenant and agree to keep confidential, in accordance with
the provisions of the Confidentiality

 



\- 40 -  Agreement, information provided to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this _Section
6.4_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

Section 6.5 _Efforts to Consummate_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) securing any consents, waivers and approvals of any Governmental
Entity or third party required to be obtained to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (regardless of whether such consent, waiver,
or approval is a condition to the Closing hereunder), provided, that the
foregoing shall not be deemed to impose any obligation on the Company or the
General Partner to pay any cost, fee or expense to such third party to obtain
such consent, waiver or approval other than any such cost, fee, or expense in
an aggregate amount not to exceed $25,000 that Parent agrees to reimburse to
the applicable Group Company and which shall be promptly reimbursed by the
Parent (it being agreed that for any such amounts in excess of $25,000 in the
aggregate, Parent shall be required to pay such amounts to the Company or the
General Partner in advance of the Company or the General Partner being
required to pay the same to the applicable third party), (ii) defending any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, the avoidance of each and every
impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give)
any notices to third parties, and each of Parent and the Company shall use,
and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any third party consents that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the Parties will furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Entity, including promptly informing the other party of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions
to a Governmental Entity, and supplying each other with copies of all material
correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement. To the extent
practicable, and permitted by a Governmental Entity, each party hereto shall
permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings (whether
by

 



\- 41 -  telephone or in person) with such Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, obtaining any approval or consent from any third party pursuant to
this _Section 6.5(b)_ or  _Section_ _ _ _6.5(a)_ above shall not be a
condition to the obligations of Parent hereunder.

Section 6.6  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees,
partners, members, equityholders, Affiliates or agents of any Group Company or
the General Partner (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ "), as provided in
such Group Companys Governing Documents or otherwise in effect as of the date
hereof with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect and that
the Group Companies will perform and discharge the Group Companies
obligations to provide such indemnity and exculpation after the Merger. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification shall be
mandatory rather than permissive, and the Surviving Entity shall advance
expenses in connection with such indemnification as provided in such Group
Companys Governing Documents or other applicable agreements. The
indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation provisions of the
Group Companies Governing Documents shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified after the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of Indemnitees, unless such modification is
required by applicable Law.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges that certain Indemnitees
may have rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance
provided by Persons (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the " _Indemnitors_ "). Parent hereby agrees (i) that the
applicable Group Company is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., their
obligations to the Indemnitees are primary and any obligation of the
Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or liabilities incurred by any Indemnitee are secondary), (ii) the
applicable Group Company shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by any Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of
all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement
to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this
Agreement, the Governing Documents of any Group Company (or any other
agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any such
Indemnitee), without regard to any rights the Indemnitee may have against the
Indemnitors, and (iii) the Group Companies irrevocably waive, relinquish and
release the Indemnitors from any and all claims against the Indemnitors for
contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. Each Group Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by
an Indemnitor on behalf of an Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which
an Indemnitee has sought indemnification from the applicable Group Company
shall affect the foregoing and the applicable Indemnitor shall have a right
of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or
payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee against the
applicable Group Company. Parent and the Indemnitees agree that the
Indemnitors are express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this
_Section 6.6(b)_.

 



\- 42 - (c) Each Indemnitee shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control
the defense of, including the investigation of, any Claim relating to any
acts or omissions covered under this _Section 6.6_ with counsel selected by
the Indemnitee; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Entity shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense and
(ii) the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

 

(d) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to,
purchase (at Parents expense) and maintain in effect beginning on the
Closing and for a period of six years thereafter without any lapses in
coverage, the directors and officers "tail" or "runoff" insurance program
currently available to be purchased under the existing directors and
officers liability insurance plan covering the Companys, its Subsidiaries
and the General Partners managers, directors and officers, to the extent such
plan remains available as of the Effective Time on materially the same terms
and conditions. To the extent that such plan is no longer available on
materially the same terms and conditions at the Effective Time, Parent will,
and will cause the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to purchase
(at Parents expense) and maintain in effect beginning on the Closing and for
a period of six years thereafter without any lapses in coverage, a directors
and officers liability "tail" or "runoff" insurance program, selected by the
General Partner (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the
term of such policy in an amount not to exceed the annual aggregate coverage
limit under the Companys existing directors and officers liability policy,
and in all other material respects shall be comparable to such existing
coverage). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Entity or any of their Subsidiaries be required to pay annual
premiums in the aggregate of more than an amount equal to 300% of the current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance to maintain or procure
insurance coverage pursuant hereto.

 

(e) The Indemnitees are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ _ _ _6.6_. This _Section 6.6_  shall survive the consummation of
the Merger and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and
the Surviving Entity.

 

Section 6.7 _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Parent and
the Surviving Entity shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books,
records and other documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies
in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available for inspection
and copying by the General Partner (at the General Partners expense) or any
Seller (at such Sellers expense) or the Representative (at the
Representatives expense) during normal business hours of Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable notice. No such books, records or documents shall
be destroyed after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date by
Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective Subsidiaries, without
first advising the General Partner and the Representative in writing and
giving the General Partner and the Representative a reasonable opportunity to
obtain possession thereof.

 

Section 6.8 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the

 



\- 43 -  termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent hereby
agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates or its or their respective employees, agents or
representatives to) contact any employee (excluding directors or officers),
customer, supplier, distributor or other material business relation of any
Group Company regarding any Group Company, its business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, without the prior
written consent of the Company.

Section 6.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
offer employment, effective as of the Closing, to each (x) Property-Level
Employee, and (y) each other employee of any Group Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to whom Parent chooses to make an offer of employment
hereunder (clauses (x) and (y) together, the " _Transferred Employees_ ").
Each offer of employment described in this _Section 6.9(a)_ shall be for, and
Parent shall during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date provide each Transferred Employee
with, (i) the same salary or hourly wage rate, in each case, as applicable to
such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits
and incentive compensation opportunity (excluding equity-based incentive
opportunity) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits and incentive compensation plans maintained or provided by Parent and
its Affiliates to their similarly-situated employees. Nothing in this
_Section 6.9(a)_ is intended to prohibit Parent or its Affiliate from
terminating employment of a Transferred Employee before the first anniversary
of the Closing Date for cause or any other reason that would support
termination of employment of one of Parents or its Affiliates current
employees in the ordinary course of business.

(b) Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall
and shall cause each Group Company to grant all of its employees credit for
any service with each Group Company and each Affiliate of a Group Company
earned prior to the Closing Date (a) for eligibility and vesting purposes and
(b) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit determinations
under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that
may be established or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "). From and
after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor the employment, severance or
similar agreements set forth on _Schedule 6.9(e)_ between any Group Company
or any Affiliate of a Group Company and any officer, director or employee
thereof in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. In addition, Parent shall, to the extent reasonably practicable (or
as permitted by the terms of the applicable plan), (i) cause to be waived all
preexisting condition exclusions and actively at work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent inapplicable to, or waived or
satisfied by an employee under any employee benefit plan maintained or
provided by the Group Companies or their Affiliates as of the Closing Date
and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses
paid on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent
thereof) of any Group Company or any Affiliate of a Group Company to be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any applicable New Plan in the year of initial participation.

 



\- 44 - (c) As of the Closing Date, Parent or its applicable Affiliate may assume and
be responsible for all liabilities and obligations under or in connection
with that certain Client Services Agreement, dated March 26, 2012 (as amended,
modified or supplemented, the " _Totalsource Agreement_ "), by and between ADP
Totalsource, Inc. and the General Partner (f/k/a Storage UPREIT Management,
LLC), provided, that, until the Closing Date, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with
ADP TotalSource, Inc. concerning the terms of such assumption that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent and provided, further, that while the Company
and General Partner shall, until the Closing Date, reasonably cooperate in
sharing information to enable Parent or its Affiliate and ADP TotalSource to
reach agreement, neither the Company nor the General Partner shall have any
obligation to ensure that such agreement is reached, nor shall the Company or
the General Partner or any of their respective Affiliates incur any
obligation, cost, fee or expense in connection with the assignment of the
Totalsource Agreement.

(d) As of the Closing, Parent shall be responsible for compliance with the
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA and the regulations thereunder (" _COBRA_ ") with respect to
Transferred Employees and any of their dependents and beneficiaries,
including with respect to the Transferred Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries who are "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" within the meaning of
COBRA.

 

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(d)_ , Parent shall be responsible for
all liabilities incurred as a result of events occurring at or after the
Closing that arise out of or relate to the employment or termination of
employment of Transferred Employees or of such other employees of any Group
Company or any of their respective Affiliates which are set forth on 
_Schedule_ _ _ _6.9(e)_ , whether at or after the Closing, and Parent shall
indemnify and hold the General Partner harmless from any such liabilities
incurred by the General Partner. In addition to, and not in limitation of,
the foregoing, to the extent that any obligations under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq., the
regulations and rules thereunder, or under any similar provision of any
federal, state, foreign or local law, rule or regulation (collectively, a "
_WARN Obligation_ ") arise with respect to any loss of employment in
connection with or as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any employees who are employees of any Group Company or any of
their respective Affiliates as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether at or after the Closing, Parent shall be solely responsible for such
WARN Obligation and any associated obligations.

 

(f) This _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_ ,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any employee of any Group
Company or any Affiliate of a Group Company any right or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.9_. Without limiting
the foregoing, no provision in this _Section 6.9_ will create any third party
beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director, officer or
consultant of any Group 

 



\- 45 -  Company or any Affiliate of a Group Company in respect of continued
employment for any period (or resumed employment), or continued receipt of any
specific employee benefit or any other matter, nor shall any provision in
this _Section 6.9_ constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any
New Plan or Employee Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.10 _Updated Disclosure Schedules_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date, the Company may prepare and deliver to
Parent and Merger Sub supplements and/or amendments to the Schedules with
respect to matters first arising after the date hereof (which may contain
additional Schedules that are not in existence as of the date hereof
relating to any of the provisions contained in Article 4) (in each case, such
supplement, amendment or new Schedule being referred to as an " _Update_ ");
provided, that each such Update shall not be deemed to be an amendment to this
Agreement or the Schedules for any purposes hereof.

Section 6.11 _Termination and Assignment of Certain Agreements_. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall have (a) caused to be terminated, each
Contract listed on _Schedule_ _ _ _6.11(a)_ (with such terminations to be
effective as of the Closing and it being understood that provisions that
expressly survive such termination in accordance with the applicable
agreement will survive such termination in accordance with the terms of the
applicable agreement), and (b) used reasonable best efforts to cause the
General Partner to assign to the Company, and the Company shall assume, all
of the General Partners obligations under the Contracts set forth on
_Schedule 6.11(b)_ (provided, that the foregoing shall not be deemed to impose
any obligation on the Company or the General Partner to obtain the consent,
approval or waiver of any third party with respect to, or incur any cost, fee
or expense in connection with, the assignment of any Contract set forth on
_Schedule 6.11(b)_ , it being agreed and understood that the failure of
the Company or the General Partner to obtain any such consent, approval or
waiver (or the failure to effect any such assignment) shall not be deemed to
be a breach or violation of this _Section_ _ _ _6.11_ or a failed condition
to Closing for any purpose hereunder, and in such event the General Partner
shall have the right (in its sole discretion) to terminate or maintain any
such Contract in accordance with the terms thereof).

 

Section 6.12 _Debt Payoff_. At least two (2) business days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of any and all pay-off or
defeasance letter(s), or other evidence of payment or defeasance, with respect
to each Debt Payoff Recipient.

 

Section 6.13 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to provide all reasonable cooperation in connection
with any debt, equity or other offering or source of financing by Parent and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing as may be reasonably requested by Parent
(provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the business of the Group Companies and the
Group Companies do not incur any out-of-pocket costs), including (a)
participation in meetings with potential lenders and underwriters, upon
reasonable prior notice by Parent, (b) furnishing Parent with pertinent
information reasonably available to the Group Companies regarding the Group
Companies and their business and properties, subject to the

 



\- 46 -  terms and conditions of the applicable confidentiality agreements, (c)
assisting Parent, to the extent reasonably necessary, in obtaining customary
accountants comfort letters and consents from the Companys accountants, and
(d) assisting with the preparation of customary materials in connection with
any such other debt, equity or other offering or source of financing by the
Parent to the extent such documents described in this clause (d) contain
disclosure reflecting or referring to any of the Group Companies.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the effectiveness of any documentation
executed by any Group Company with respect to any assistance required pursuant
to this  _Section 6.13(a)_ shall be subject in all events to the consummation
of the Closing, failing which, such documentation shall be void and of no
force or effect; and (ii) no Group Company shall be required to take any
action pursuant to this  _Section 6.13(a)_ that would reasonably be expected
to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, its Organizational Documents
or any applicable Laws.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, references to " _Debt Financing
Commitments_ " shall refer to (i) the commitment letter dated as of the date
hereof relating to a $1.35 Billion Senior Unsecured Acquisition Bridge
Facility by and among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., SunTrust Bank, and SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as lenders, and Sovran Self Storage, Inc. and
Parent, and (ii) the commitment letter dated as of the date hereof relating to
a $325 Million Senior Unsecured Backstop Bridge Facility by and among Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as lenders,
and Sovran Self Storage, Inc. and Parent, executed copies of which have
heretofore been furnished to the Company, and the " _Debt Financing_ " shall
refer to the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments. In no
event shall Parent amend, modify or supplement, or waive any material right or
condition under, the Debt Financing Commitments in any manner that would, or
would reasonably be expected to, materially and adversely affect or delay
Parents ability to consummate the Merger without the prior written consent of
the Company. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonable basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Debt Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming
aware of, or receiving written notice with respect to, any unavailability of
the Debt Financing or termination of any provision of the Debt Financing
Commitments that would reasonably be expected to result in an amount being
available less than what is required to pay any and all amounts required to be
paid by Parent or Merger Sub hereunder. If any portion of the Debt Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any applicable
market flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company thereof and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay any and all amounts
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub hereunder as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. To the extent Parent
finances the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by raising money
through an equity offering or through any alternative financing source, Parent
shall not be obligated to continue to pursue the Debt Financing or may pursue
it in a lesser amount of Debt Financing.

 



\- 47 - (c) The Group Companies, the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or equityholders shall not have any rights or claims against any of
the commercial banks, investment banks or other financial institutions
providing financing to Parent or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each a " _Debt Financing Party_
") in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the performance of any financing commitments of
such Debt Financing Party with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. No Debt
Financing Party shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or
otherwise) to any Group Company, the Sellers and their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or equityholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the performance of
any financing commitments. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any claims or causes of action brought against any Debt Financing Party in its
capacity as such will not be brought in any forum other than the federal and
New York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of
New York and shall be governed by the law of the State of New York. It is
further agreed that the Debt Financing Parties are intended third-party
beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the protections of this _Section
6.13(c)_ and _Section 10.8_.

Section 6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from
any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Termination Date or (ii) it fails to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement such that the
applicable closing conditions would reasonably be expected to be incapable of
being satisfied by the Termination Date; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
or the rights of termination of the parties under this Agreement.

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any material suit, litigation, arbitration,
claim, action or proceeding commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving such party or any of the Group
Companies or the Subsidiaries of Parent, respectively,

 



\- 48 -  which relate to this Agreement, the Merger, or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any Unitholder or
Warrant Holder litigation against the Company, the General Partner, and/or its
controlling persons relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The existence of any such
litigation shall not, in and of itself, have any effect on the satisfaction of
any of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 7._

Section 6.15 _Public_ _Announcements_. Except for the disclosure permitted by
this  _Section 6.15_ , prior to the Closing Date, none of the Parties nor any
of their respective Affiliates shall issue any press release or public
statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
without obtaining the prior written approval of the other Parties (which
approval the other Parties shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or
delay). Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that, on or following the
date hereof, the Parties or certain of their Affiliates intend to make a
public announcement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, which shall be subject to this _Section 6.15_ ;
_provided_ that any such public announcement, press release or other public
disclosure shall be made in the form, and include only the content, reasonably
agreed upon by the Parties prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a Party or its applicable Affiliates may make such disclosure as
it determines in good faith is required by applicable Law, or by an
obligation pursuant to any agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities association of the United States or any other
jurisdiction, including disclosures in connection with any debt or equity
offering by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent; _provided_ __ that, prior to
issuing any such press release or public statement or other disclosure that
contains any material information not contained in any prior press release,
public statement, or other public disclosure, such Party or its applicable
Affiliates shall advise the other Parties of such press release or public
statement, shall discuss the contents of the disclosure with the
other Parties and shall consider in good faith any modifications to such
press release or public statement requested by the other Parties. Each Party
and its Affiliates also may make announcements to its employees that are
consistent with the public disclosures made by such Party.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the satisfaction
(or, if permitted by applicable Law, waiver by the party for whose benefit

(a) no Law, executive order, decree or permanent injunction or other order
issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity

elsewhere in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 8

 

TERMINATION

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by Parent, if any of the representations or warranties of the Company set
forth in _Article 4_ shall not be true and correct or if the Company has
failed to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement (including an obligation to consummate the Closing)
such that, in each case, the condition to Closing set forth in either 
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, as applicable, would not be satisfied
and the breach or breaches causing such representations or warranties not to
be true and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant or agreement, as
applicable, are not cured within twenty (20) Business Days after written
notice thereof is delivered to the Company; provided that Parent and Merger
Sub are not then in breach of this Agreement so as to prevent the condition to
Closing set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ from being
satisfied;

(c) by the Company, if any of the representations or warranties of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in _Article 5_ shall not be true and correct or if
either Parent or Merger Sub has failed to perform any covenant or agreement on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement (including an
obligation to consummate the Closing) such that, in each case, the condition
to Closing set forth in either _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ would
not be satisfied and the breach or breaches causing such representations or
warranties not to be true and correct, or the failures to perform any covenant
or agreement, as applicable, are not cured within twenty

 



\- 51 -  (20) Business Days after written notice thereof is delivered to Parent;
provided that the Company is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to
prevent the condition to Closing set forth in  _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)_ from being satisfied;

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have been consummated on or prior to August 15, 2016 (as
such date may be extended as provided in _Section 10.19(b)_, the "
_Termination Date_ "); provided, that the Party seeking to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not have breached its
obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have primarily
caused the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or before the Termination Date; or

(e) by either Parent or the Company, if any Governmental Entity shall have
issued any order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and such order, decree or ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable; provided, that the Party seeking to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall have used reasonable
best efforts to remove such order, decree, ruling or other action; provided,
further, that no Party shall be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if the imposition of such order, decree,
ruling or other action was primarily due to the failure of such Party to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this entire Agreement shall forthwith
become void (and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective officers, directors or
equityholders) with the exception of (a) the proviso in clause (i) of
_Section 6.5(a)_ and the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _8.2_ , _Section
6.4_ , _Section 6.13(c)_ , _Article 9_ and _Article 10_ and the definitions of
all defined terms appearing in such sections, each of which provisions shall
survive such termination and remain valid and binding obligations of the
Parties, and (b) any liability of any Party hereto for any willful or
intentional breach of or failure to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement prior to such termination (and, for the avoidance of doubt, any
failure by Parent or Merger Sub or the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement when such transactions are required to
be consummated pursuant to _Section 2.2_ shall be deemed to be a willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement); provided, that in the case of any such
willful or intentional breach by a Party and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Parties agree that the Company and the
Sellers, in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, and Parent in the
case of a breach by the Company shall be irreparably harmed by such breach
(notwithstanding the fact that the Sellers are not signatories hereto), and
the Sellers and the non-breaching Parties shall be entitled to all remedies
available at law or in equity, including equitable relief (including specific
performance, and in each case without the necessity of proving actual harm or
posting a bond or other security), consequential, indirect and/or special
damages, damages for the benefit of the bargain lost by the Sellers and the
non-breaching Parties (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including the opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on

 



\- 52 -  this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger and
the time value of money), and, in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger
Sub, diminution in value of the Group Companies and the reimbursement of the
Sellers and the non-breaching Parties costs and expenses. The Parties
expressly agree that the Company shall be entitled to receive any damages that
may be claimed by Sellers. Nothing herein shall limit or prevent any party
hereto from exercising any rights or remedies it may have under _Section
10.19_. Each of the parties acknowledge and agree that the Sellers are express
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 8.2_ and are entitled to enforce
the provisions of this _Section 8.2_ against Parent and Merger Sub (including
by bringing any claim, action, suit or other proceeding against Parent or
Merger Sub, whether for damages, equitable relief or otherwise).

faith under this Agreement or the Representative Engagement Agreement are
hereby waived. The Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon the

Agreement and the Representative Engagement Agreement. The Sellers shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Representative (and its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees (collectively, the "

willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Representative shall not be
required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

action unless the Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Representative in performing such actions; provided, that
amounts paid to the Representative pursuant to the Representative Engagement
Agreement were determined by the Representative to be sufficient remuneration
for acting as the Representative of the Sellers for the purposes contemplated
by this Agreement.

Representative Engagement Agreement, a Letter of Transmittal or otherwise, a
fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller. The Representative Group

liability imposed by law for its own fraud, willful misconduct or
gross negligence. The Representative shall not be required to make any
inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement, a Letter of Transmittal or any
other Ancillary Document. The Representative shall not be responsible to the
Sellers for the value, validity, effectiveness, enforceability or sufficiency
of this Agreement or any other Ancillary Documents nor shall the
Representative be under any obligation to any Seller to ensure the observance
or performance by Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations under this
Agreement. Neither the Representative Group nor any agent employed by it shall
incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of
the Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated

construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause

\- 57 - Section 10.6 _Construction; Interpretation_. The term "this Agreement" means
this Agreement and Plan of Merger together with all Schedules and exhibits to
this Agreement (" _Exhibits_ "), as the same may from time to time be amended,
modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
No party hereto, nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of
this Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair
meaning and not strictly for or against any party. When calculating the period
of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done
or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date
in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period
is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day. Any reference in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$"
shall mean U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by
the context or use thereof: (a) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and
words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the
Schedules and Exhibits, and not to any particular section, subsection
paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (b) masculine
gender shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa;
(c) words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice
versa; and (d) the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed
to be followed by the words "without limitation". An item arising with respect
to a specific representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on"
or "set forth in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent any
such phrase appears in such representation or warranty, if (i) there is a
reserve, accrual or other similar item underlying a number on such balance
sheet or financial statements that related to the subject matter of such
representation or warranty, (ii) such item is otherwise specifically set forth
on the balance sheet or financial statements or (iii) such item is reflected
on the balance sheet or financial statements and is specifically set forth in
the notes thereto.

Section 10.7 _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules or
other documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set
out in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed on any Schedule referenced
by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been
disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any
Schedule is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or lower
amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the inclusion of
any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any obligation,
items or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure on any Schedule
relating to a possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or order shall
be construed as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or
has actually occurred. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or the
Schedules but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in
this Agreement.

 



\- 58 - Section 10.8 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon

permitted assigns and, except as provided in _Section 6.6_, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Sellers are
third party beneficiaries of _Article 2_, _Section 8.2_, _Article 9_, and 
_Section 10.15_, (b) the Indemnitees are third party beneficiaries of
_Section 6.6_, (c) the General Partner is a third party beneficiary of

Commitments are third party beneficiaries of _Section 6.13(c)_ and clause (a)
of _Section 8.2_.

is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

 

Section 10.10 _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to applicable
Law and _Section 10.11_ , this Agreement may be amended or modified only in
accordance with _Section 6.10_ or by a written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.
After the Effective Time, subject to applicable Law, this Agreement may be
amended or modified only by written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the Surviving Entity and the Representative. This
Agreement may not be modified or amended except as provided in
the immediately preceding two sentences and any purported amendment by any
party or parties hereto effected in a manner which does not comply with this
_Section 10.10_ shall be void.

 

Section 10.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the

or Merger Sub contained herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein or

the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
any party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

 

Section 10.12 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



\- 59 - Section 10.13 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. The obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder are jointly and severally guaranteed by each
other.

Section 10.14 _Independent Analysis; No Other Representations; Acquisition
for Investment_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that it
has conducted its own independent review and analysis of, and, based thereon,
has formed an independent judgment concerning, the business, assets, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations and prospects of the Group Companies, and
made an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents to which it is a party
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

(b) In entering into this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub represent, warrant,
covenant and agree, on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates and
their respective financing sources, that in determining to enter into and
consummate this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any
related financing, that they have relied solely upon the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article 4_ , and have not
relied upon any other representation or warranty made or purported to be made
by any Person. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges, on behalf of
themselves, their respective Affiliates and their respective financing
sources, that, other than as set forth in _Article 4_ , none of the Sellers,
the Group Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, equityholders, partners, agents or representatives makes or has
made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, regarding any
matter, including (i) as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub or any of
their respective agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates or (ii) with
respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future
financial condition (or any component thereof) of any Group Company heretofore
or hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent and Merger Sub or any of
their respective agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of the Sellers, the Group
Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, equityholders, partners, agents or representatives has made, and
shall not be deemed to have made, any representations or warranties in the
materials relating to the business, assets or liabilities of the Group
Companies made available to Parent or Merger Sub, including due
diligence materials, memoranda or similar materials, or in any presentation
of the business of the Group Companies by management of the Company or others

Section 10.15 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or otherwise, this Agreement may only be enforced against,

relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of

acknowledge, on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates and their
respective financing sources, that no recourse under this Agreement or any
documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be had against any
Seller or Affiliate thereof, or former, current or future direct or
indirect equity holder, controlling Person, management company, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate,
attorney or representative of, or any financial advisor or lender to (all
above-described Persons, collectively, " _Affiliated Persons_ ") a Seller or
any Affiliate of such Seller, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or
by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation
or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no
personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be
incurred by any Seller, any of their Affiliates or their respective Affiliated
Persons, for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this Agreement
or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. Without
limiting the rights of any party against the other parties hereto, in no event
shall any party or any of its Affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement

\- 61 - Section 10.16 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing Date, except for any
rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents that

behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates and each of its current and former

Releasing Parties may have against each of the Released Parties, now or
in the future, in each case, in respect of any cause, matter or thing
relating to any of the Released Parties occurring or arising on or prior to
the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.17 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY WAIVE, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED
HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH
HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF
ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 10.18 _JURISDICTION AND VENUE_. EACH OF THE PARTIES SUBMITS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE CHANCERY COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (OR, IF
THE CHANCERY COURT DECLINES TO ACCEPT JURISDICTION OVER A PARTICULAR MATTER,
ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN DELAWARE) IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN
RESPECT OF THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH
COURT AND AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY OTHER COURT. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY
DEFENSE OF INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
SO BROUGHT AND WAIVES ANY BOND, SURETY OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE
REQUIRED OF ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT
SERVICE OF SUMMONS AND

 



\- 62 -  COMPLAINT OR ANY OTHER PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE SERVED IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE ON SUCH PARTY BY SENDING OR DELIVERING A COPY OF THE
PROCESS TO THE PARTY TO BE SERVED AT THE ADDRESS OF THE PARTY AND IN THE
MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF NOTICES IN _SECTION 10.3_. NOTHING IN THIS
_SECTION 10.18_, HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL
PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A FINAL,
NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT SHALL BE
CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY JURISDICTION BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR
IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

 

Section 10.19 _Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies
provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform their respective obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief when available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis
that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Seller, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) To the extent any Party brings a proceeding, action or other similar
process to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement prior to the Closing (other than an action brought following
valid termination of this Agreement to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement), and such remedy
is available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Termination Date shall automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following the resolution of such proceeding, action or other
similar process or (ii) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such proceeding, action or other similar process.

 



\- 63 - Section 10.20 _Waiver of Conflicts; Non-Assertion of Attorney-Client
Privilege_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that Latham and Watkins LLP ("
_Prior Company Counsel_ ") has, on or prior to the Closing Date, represented
one or more of the Sellers and the Company, its Subsidiaries and other
Affiliates, and their respective partners, members, equityholders, officers,
employees and directors (each such Person, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, a " _Designated Person_ ") in one or more matters relating to
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(including any matter that may be related to a litigation, claim or
dispute arising under or related to this Agreement or such other agreements
or in connection with such transactions) (each, an " _Existing Representation_
"), and that, in the event of any post-Closing matters (i) relating to this
Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
(including any matter that may be related to a litigation, claim or dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement or such other agreements or in
connection with such transactions) and (ii) in which Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and one or more
Designated Persons, on the other hand, are or may be adverse to each other
(each, a " _Post-Closing Matter_ "), the Designated Persons reasonably
anticipate that Prior Company Counsel will represent them in connection with
such matters. Accordingly, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Entity hereby (A) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing
to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any conflict of interest
arising out of or relating to the representation by one or more Prior Company
Counsel of one or more Designated Persons in connection with one or more
Post-Closing Matters (the " _Post-Closing Representations_ ") and (B) agrees
that, in the event that a Post-Closing Matter arises, Prior Company Counsel
may represent one or more Designated Persons in such Post-Closing Matter even
though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries), and even though Prior
Company Counsel may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a
matter substantially related to such dispute. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity (on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates) consents to the disclosure by Prior Company Counsel, in
connection with one or more Post-Closing Representations, to the Designated
Persons of any information learned by Prior Company Counsel in the course of
one or more Existing Representations, whether or not such information is
subject to the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and/or Prior Company Counsels duty of confidentiality as to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and whether or not such disclosure is made
before or after the Closing.

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity (on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates) waives and shall not assert, and agrees after the Closing
to cause its Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client
privilege, attorney work-product protection or expectation of client
confidence with respect to any communication between any Prior Company
Counsel, on the one hand, and any Designated Person or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Pre-Closing Designated Persons_ "), or
any advice given to any Pre-Closing Designated Person by any Prior Company
Counsel, occurring during one or more Existing Representations (collectively,
" _Pre-Closing Privileges_ ") in connection with any Post-Closing 

 



\- 64 -  Representation, including in connection with a dispute between any
Designated Person and one or more of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity
and their respective Affiliates, it being the intention of the Parties that
all rights to such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all rights to waiver or
otherwise control such Pre-Closing Privilege, shall be retained by the General
Partner, and shall not pass to or be claimed or used by Parent, Merger Sub or
the Surviving Entity, except as provided in the last sentence of this _Section
10.20(b)_. Furthermore, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Entity
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) acknowledges and agrees that any
advice given to or communication with any of the Designated Persons shall not
be subject to any joint privilege (whether or not the Company or one more of
its Subsidiaries also received such advice or communication) and shall be
owned solely by such Designated Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and a third party other
than a Designated Person, on the other hand, the Surviving Entity shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) assert the Pre-Closing Privileges on behalf of
the Designated Persons to prevent disclosure of Privileged Materials to such
third party; provided, however, that such privilege may be waived only with
the prior written consent, and shall be waived upon the written instruction,
of the General Partner.

 

(c) All such Pre-Closing Privileges, and all books and records and other
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries containing any advice or
communication that is subject to any Pre-Closing Designated Privilege ("
_Privileged Materials_ "), shall be excluded from the purchase, and shall be
distributed to the General Partner (on behalf of the applicable Designated
Persons) immediately prior to the Closing with (in the case of such books and
records) no copies retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Absent
the prior written consent of the General Partner, neither Parent or Merger Sub
nor (following the Closing) the Surviving Entity shall have a right of access
to Privileged Materials.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub each hereby acknowledges that it has had the
opportunity (including on behalf of its Affiliates and the Surviving Entity)
to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and
material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the
waivers, permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the
opportunity to consult with counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This
_Section 10.20_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 10.20_
may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the
General Partner and its Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.

 

Section 10.21 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

3 General Instructions

 

 _Please read this information carefully._

 

BOX A  Registered Holder: All registered holders must complete Box A. If your
permanent address should change in the future, please notify [ ● ] at the
number listed below.

BOX B  Certificate Detail: List all certificate numbers (if any) and Company
Unit Certificates submitted in Box B. If you believe your Units are
uncertificated, please contact the Company prior to returning this Letter of
Transmittal, as all Units have been certificated. If your certificate(s) are
lost, please check the appropriate box below Box A, complete the Letter of
Transmittal and return the Letter of Transmittal to [ ● ]. You will be
contacted if a fee and/or additional documents are required to replace lost
unit certificate(s). You do not need to sign the back of your certificate.
Originals are required for valid presentment of Unit certificates.

 

BOX C  New Registration: Provide the new registration instructions (name and
address) in Box C if your payment is to be made to anyone other than the
registered holder of your Units. Signature must be that of the new
registration indicated. All changes in registration require a Medallion
Signature Guarantee. Joint registrations must include the form of tenancy.
Custodial registrations must include the name of the custodian (only one).
Trust account registrations must include the names of all current acting
trustees and the date of the trust agreement. If your payment is to be made

broker/dealer, credit union or savings institution participating in a
Medallion program approved by the Securities Transfer Association. 
---|---|---|--- 

BOX F  Wire Instructions: To elect a bank wire transfer please complete Box
F in its entirety. A bank wire transfer, rather than payment by check, will
help to expedite your receipt of the funds. Please contact your bank for
questions regarding the appropriate bank routing number and account number to
be used.

IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8; Certificate of Non-Foreign Status:
If the person receiving payment for the Units is a "U.S. person" (see
definition below), complete and sign (i) the enclosed IRS Form W-9 to certify
that the payees tax identification number ("TIN") is correct and whether
such person is subject to backup withholding and (ii) the applicable version
of the enclosed FIRPTA certificate to certify such payees non-foreign status.
Certain holders or payees (including, among others, corporations, non-
resident foreign individuals and foreign entities) are not subject to backup
withholding and reporting requirements. If the person receiving payment for
the Units is not a "U.S. person," complete and sign an applicable IRS Form
W-8 (usually, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E). IRS Form W-9 or IRS Forms W-8 may
be obtained at www.irs.gov.

 



4 further guidance regarding the completion of IRS Form W-9, IRS Form W-8BEN, or
other applicable IRS Form W-8 to claim exemption from backup withholding.
Failure to provide a properly completed and signed IRS Form W-9 or a properly
completed and signed IRS Form W-8BEN or other applicable IRS Form W-8 may
result in backup withholding under U.S. law on any merger consideration
payments and may result in a penalty imposed by the IRS. 
---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  | Definition of "U.S. Person": For U.S. federal tax
purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are (1) an individual who is
a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, (2) a partnership,
corporation, company or association created or organized in the United States
or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of
Columbia, (3) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
tax regardless of its source, or (4) a domestic trust (as defined in U.S.
Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-7). 
---|---|---|--- 

Deficient Presentments: If you request a registration change that is not in
proper form, the required documentation will be requested from you and this
will delay processing of any funds.

For purposes of this Non-Foreign Entity Certificate, " _Transferor_ " is: 
.

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
"), provides that a transferee of a United States real property interest must
withhold tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For United States tax
purposes (including section 1445 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded
entity (which has legal title to a United States real property interest under
local law) will be the transferor of the property and not the disregarded
entity. To inform [ ● ] (the " _Transferee_ ") that withholding of tax is not
required in respect of the Transferor upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of [ ● ], 2016, the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf
of Transferor:

1\. Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign
trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury
Regulations);

2\. Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) ( _i.e_., an entity that is disregarded as an
entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, such as
certain single member limited liability companies);

 

3\. Transferors United States employer identification number is 
; and

4. Transferors office address is  .

 

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct, and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
Transferor.

_Transferee_ ") that withholding of tax is not required in respect of the
Transferor upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of [ ● ], 2016, I,
as Transferor, hereby certify the following:

1\. I am not a nonresident alien for purposes of United States income
taxation;

 

2\. My United States taxpayer identification number (Social Security number)
is  ; and
