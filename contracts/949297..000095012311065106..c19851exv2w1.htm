Delaware limited liability company (" _Parent_ "), Blackhawk Merger Sub,
Inc., an Illinois corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("

respective boards of directors of the Company and Acquisition Sub have
unanimously approved and deemed advisable, and the board of directors of
Parent, as the sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub, has unanimously approved
this Agreement and the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into Company (the "

forth herein and in accordance with the Business Corporation Act of 1983 of
the State of Illinois (the " _IBCA_ "). 

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Acquisition Sub to enter into
this Agreement, each of the stockholders of the Company named therein has
executed a Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the " _Voting

Section 2.3 _Effective Time._  

   

(a) Concurrently with the Closing, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall cause articles of merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with respect to
the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Illinois (the " _Secretary of State_ ") as provided under the IBCA. The
Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the Articles of
Merger have been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date

of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and

Section 2.6 _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the

    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE III 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 

   

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition Sub or
the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition Sub: 

   

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of the Companys common 
shares, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), held by the
Company as treasury stock or held by Parent, Acquisition Sub, any other
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in
exchange therefor or in respect thereof. 

   

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each share of Common Stock (including Unvested Restricted
Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares canceled pursuant to  _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof and Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $8.55 in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Common Stock to be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist and the holders of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry
shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_
of this Agreement, the applicable Merger Consideration, without interest
thereon. 

   

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each common share, no par value per share, of Acquisition Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one (1) fully paid common share, no par value per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock occurs as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date
during such period, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates._  

   

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_.
Immediately prior to the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary
of State, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying
Agent, cash constituting an amount equal to the Total Common Merger
Consideration (such Total Common Merger Consideration as deposited with the
Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ and
_Section 3.3(d)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Paying Agent
shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders
of Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.3(d)_ , except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement. 

   

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time and in
any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (or to make
available for collection by hand) (i) to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Common Stock (x) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable
Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide
that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares may be surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the
applicable Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be collected by hand
by the surrendering holder or by wire transfer to the surrendering holder). 

   

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger
Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed, made available for
collection by hand or delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the
surrendering holder, within two (2) Business Days following the later to
occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share,
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the
applicable Merger Consideration (or the cash pursuant to _Section 3.2(d)_)
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
designated for distribution to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares that remains undistributed as of the one hundred eighty (180) day
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon Parents
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent as
general creditors thereof for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration
for cash, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled. 

   

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to
two (2) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority), any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. 

   

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such
investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article III_, and if the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment under _Section
3.1(b)_ or _Section 3.3(d_), Parent shall promptly provide additional funds
to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock in the
amount of such shortcoming, (ii) no such investment shall have maturities
that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement,
and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United
States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent
directs. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(g) _Withholding_. Parent or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any person such amounts as Parent or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law,
_provided that_ , other than United States federal backup
withholding resulting from any payees failure to provide the documentation
required to establish an exemption from such backup withholding, neither
Parent nor the Paying Agent shall withhold any amount with respect to Taxes
to the extent that Parent has not notified the Company in writing at least
three days prior to the Closing Date of its intent to withhold such
amount. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person who otherwise would have received
the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Paying Agent. 

  

Section 3.3 _Stock Options and Unvested Restricted Shares._  

   

(a) _Vesting of Company Options_. The parties acknowledge and agree that as
of the Effective Time, (A) each Director Option shall vest in full and (B)
one-half of the unvested portion of each Employee Option shall become fully
vested, with the remaining unvested portion to remain outstanding and
continue to vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the governing
option agreement and as set forth below. 

   

(b) _Treatment of Vested Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, each
holder of a Company Option that has vested and is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, in lieu of receiving Common
Stock, have the right thereafter and during the term of such Company Option
(subject however to all the terms and conditions of the applicable Company
Plan and the agreement governing such Company Option) to receive
upon exercise thereof an amount equal to the product of (A) the Merger
Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which might have
been obtained upon exercise at the Effective Time of the then-vested portion
of such Company Option, less the amount of the exercise price of such vested
Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "). 

   

(c) _Treatment of Unvested Company Options_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that any Company Options that are unvested as of the Effective Time,
after taking into account the provisions of clause (a) above, shall continue
to remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with the terms set
forth in the applicable Company Plan and governing option agreement. In
addition, each option agreement provides certain circumstances for the
acceleration of the vesting of such unvested portion of Company Options. At
such time or times as a Company Option or portion thereof shall vest
following the Effective Time, whether in the ordinary course or as a result
of an event triggering acceleration, the holder shall immediately be entitled
to exercise the vested portion of such Company Option by delivering notice to
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation and shall thereafter only be entitled
to receive an amount equal to the Option Cash Payment for such Company Option
portion. Parent shall promptly make such Option Cash Payment to the holder
upon receipt of the notice of exercise, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereof. The Company represents that as of the date hereof,
based on the Merger Consideration, its best estimate of the aggregate Option
Cash Payments for all outstanding unvested Company Options that will be
unvested as of the Effective Time (were the Effective Time to occur on the
date hereof), after taking into account the provisions of clause (a) above,
is $5,570,832. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) _Treatment of Unvested Restricted Shares_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that at the Effective Time, each Unvested Restricted Share shall become
fully vested and shall be treated in the same manner as other shares of
Common Stock under _Section 3.1_. 

   

(e) _Tax Withholding_. All amounts payable as a result of this _Section 3.3_
shall be reduced by the amount required to be withheld under applicable
federal, state or local income or other tax. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in
respect of whom such withholding was made. 

   

(f) _Further Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.3_, including providing
holders of Company Options with notice of their rights with respect to any
such Company Options as provided herein; _provided_ that the Company will
provide to Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such
notice prior to distributing such notice to any holders of Company Options. 

   

(g) _Funding_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
the Total Vested Option Consideration to the Company, which shall make the
payments set forth in  _Section 3.3(b)_ to the extent such vested Company
Options have not otherwise been exercised. 

  

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof
is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. 

  

Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(b)_ hereof, to
the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 11.65 of the IBCA, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section
11.70 of the IBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, but the holders of
such Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 11.70 of
the IBCA and, as applicable, would be entitled to receive only such
consideration as determined pursuant to Section 11.70 of the IBCA; _provided_
, _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost his or her right to appraisal
and payment under the IBCA, such holders shares of Common Stock
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting
Shares. Any 

 

    ##### 

  

   

 payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be
made by Parent (and not the Company) and the Aggregate Merger Consideration
shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, as if the holder of such
Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the Closing Date. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demand for appraisal received by
the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the IBCA, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the IBCA,
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The
Company shall not make or agree to make any payment or settlement offer, or
approve (if required) any withdrawal of such demands, prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent
shall have given its prior written consent to such payment, settlement offer
or withdrawal. 

  

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective
Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable
Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(b)_ hereof, for each
share of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. 

  

ARTICLE IV 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed or (to the extent
publicly available) furnished after December 31, 2008 but before the date of
this Agreement or (ii) as disclosed in the corresponding sections or
subsections of the separate disclosure letter which has been delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
as follows: 

  

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized
or formed, validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization or formation and has the requisite corporate,
partnership or limited liability company power and authority and all
necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 4.2 _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Company has made
available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation and the By-laws (or equivalent organizational
documents), each as amended to date, of the Company and each of its
subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the By-
laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Company and each of its
subsidiaries are in full force and effect. None of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is in violation of any provision of its Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation or the By-laws (or equivalent organizational
documents), except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

Section 4.3 _Capitalization._  

   

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares
of Common Stock and 50,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.01 per share
(the " _Preferred Stock_ "). As of July 5, 2011 (the " _Capitalization Date_
"), (i) 53,519,267 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding
(including 286,000 Unvested Restricted Shares), and (ii) 2,233,615 shares of
Common Stock were held in treasury. No shares of Preferred Stock have been
issued or are outstanding. As of the Capitalization Date, there
were 6,613,367 shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for future
issuance under the Company Plans (including, as of the Capitalization Date,
outstanding Company Options to purchase 5,599,681 shares of Common Stock).
Section 4.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of options, unvested restricted stock and stock purchase rights
under the Company Plans, including the holder, date of grant, term, number of
underlying shares of Common Stock and, where applicable, exercise price.
Except as set forth above, since the Capitalization Date, no shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the Company, or
options, warrants or other rights to acquire any such stock or securities
were granted, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All outstanding 
shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares that may be issued
pursuant to the Company Plans will be, when issued in accordance with the
terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
and not subject to preemptive or similar rights. No bonds, debentures, notes
or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any matters on which
stockholders may vote in respect of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
are issued or outstanding. 

   

(b) Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies each subsidiary
of the Company and indicates its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the
issued and outstanding  shares of capital stock of each subsidiary of the
Company is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
directly or indirectly owned by the Company, free and clear of all Liens. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) Except as set forth above, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights,
agreements, commitments or contracts of any kind to which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is bound obligating the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
issue, redeem, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, redeemed, delivered or
sold, additional shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interests in, or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable
for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to issue, redeem, grant, extend or enter into any such security,
option, warrant, call, right or contract, or obligating the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to make any payments directly or indirectly based (in
whole or in part) on the price or value of its or their capital stock. There
are no voting trust or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or
registration, or restricting any person from purchasing, selling, pledging or
otherwise disposing of (or from granting any option or similar right
with respect to), any shares of Common Stock except for any restrictions
contained in the applicable Company Plan. The Company has not adopted a
stockholder rights plan. 

   

(d) As of the Capitalization Date, there is no outstanding indebtedness for
borrowed money of the Company and its subsidiaries (not including
intercompany indebtedness or, for the avoidance of doubt, operating or
capital leases), whether under the Companys Revolving Credit and Security
Agreement, dated as of May 5, 2008, as amended, among the Company,
the lenders identified therein, and PNC Bank, National Association, as agent
for the lenders, or otherwise. 

  

Section 4.4 _Authority Relative to Agreement._  

   

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject
only to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to
the Merger, the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, as well as the
filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State). This Agreement
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition Sub,
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to
general equitable principles). 

   

(b) The Companys Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held,
has unanimously (i) adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and Companys
stockholders, (iii) directed that the Company submit the adoption of this
Agreement to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (iv) resolved to
recommend that the Companys stockholders approve the Merger and this
Agreement at a meeting of the stockholders. The action of the Companys Board
of Directors in approving the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby is sufficient to render the provisions of
Sections 7.85 and 11.75 of the IBCA inapplicable to consummation of the
Merger and the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, no other "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or similar anti-takeover laws apply
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the
Companys Board of Directors has resolved to elect, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, not to be subject to any "control share acquisition,"
"fair price," "moratorium" or similar anti-takeover law that might
otherwise apply to the Merger.

Section 4.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents._  

   

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) conflict
with or violate the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws
(or equivalent organizational documents) of (A) the Company or (B) any of its
subsidiaries, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals and authorizations
specified in _Section 4.5(b)_ have been received and the waiting periods
referred to therein have expired, conflict with or violate any Law applicable
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which any property or asset
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (iii)
result in any breach of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise in others any right of
termination, amendment, modification, acceleration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture or credit agreement, or any other contract, agreement,
lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective assets is
bound or affected, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, modification,
acceleration or Lien that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

   

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, authorization, waiver or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority,
except for applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, (ii) the HSR Act
and any other applicable U.S. or foreign competition, antitrust, merger
control or investment Laws (together with the HSR Act, " _Antitrust Laws_ "),
(iii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State
of Illinois as provided under the IBCA and (iv) the rules of NASDAQ, and
except where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations,
waivers or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 4.6 _Permits and Licenses; Compliance with Laws_. Each of the Company
and its subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders necessary for the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to own, lease and operate the properties of the Company
and its subsidiaries or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted
(the " _Company Permits_ "), and no suspension or cancellation of any of the
Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any
of the Company Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of the Company, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries is pending
or threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated an intention to
conduct the same, except for those the outcome of which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is,
and since January 1, 2008 has at all times been in compliance with, (i) all
Laws applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which
any property or asset of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or
affected, (ii) all of the Company Permits and (iii) each note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any property or asset of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is bound or affected, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Since January 1, 2009, none of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority regarding any
actual or possible violation of, or failure to comply with, in any material
respect, any applicable Law. 

  

Section 4.7 _Company SEC Documents._  

   

(a) Since December 31, 2008, the Company has filed with the SEC all forms,
documents, statements, certifications and reports required to be filed or
furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC (the forms, documents,
statements, certifications and reports filed or furnished since December 31,
2008 and those filed or furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including
any amendments thereto, collectively the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective dates, or, if amended or superceded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, as of the date of such amendment or superceding
filing, the Company SEC Documents complied or, if not yet filed or furnished
will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities

regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents at
the time it was filed or furnished, contained or, if not yet filed or
furnished, will contain when filed or furnished any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, or are to be made, not misleading.
No executive officer of the Company has failed to make the certifications
required by him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, with respect to any Company SEC Document, except as disclosed in
certifications filed with the Company SEC Documents. No subsidiary of the
Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act
or is otherwise required to file any forms, documents, statements,
certifications or reports with the SEC. The Company has made available to
Parent correct and complete copies of all correspondence between the SEC, on

occurring since December 31, 2008 and prior to the date of this Agreement and
not available on the SECs EDGAR system prior to the date of this Agreement.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no unresolved comments issued by
the staff of the SEC with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents filed
on or prior to the date of this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Documents fairly present, or, in the case of Company SEC
Documents filed after the date hereof, will fairly present, in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal recurring year-end audit adjustments that are not
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material in amount, to the
absence of notes and to any other adjustments described therein, including
in any notes thereto) and have been prepared in conformity with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto). 

  

Section 4.8 _Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting_. The Company has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting (as
such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic
reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the required time periods. The Company and its
subsidiaries have implemented and maintain a system of internal controls over
financial reporting that is sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations
of NASDAQ. Since January 3, 2011 through the date hereof, the Company has not
identified (i) any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which is reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information or (ii) any fraud or allegation of
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. 

  

Section 4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 3, 2011 (i)
through the date of this Agreement, except for the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries
have been conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (ii) there has not been any event, development or state of
circumstances that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and (iii) through the date
of this Agreement, there has not been any action that, if taken after the
date hereof without the prior approval of Parent, would constitute (x) a
breach of clause (d), (j), (k), (n) or (o) of  _Section 6.1_, or (y) a
breach of clause (e), (f) or (l) of _Section 6.1_ in any material respect.

or otherwise, whether or not required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company and
its subsidiaries, other than those which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 

  

Section 4.11 _Absence of Litigation_. Except for matters that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (a) there is no claim, action, proceeding,
inquiry, hearing, arbitration or investigation pending or, to the knowledge

    ##### 

  

   

(b) No Company Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan nor is any Company Benefit

No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the

has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, either directly or by reason of their affiliation with any
" _ERISA Affiliate_ " (defined as any organization which is a member of
a controlled group of organizations within the meaning of Sections 414 of the
Code), to any tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA,
the Code or other applicable Laws, except for events or conditions that would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect; no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section
4975 of the Code) and no failure to meet minimum funding standards (within
the meaning of Sections 412 or 430 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA),
whether or not waived, has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan
that would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect; and each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in
Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been in documentary and
operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance
promulgated thereunder by the Department of Treasury, except for instances of
noncompliance that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

issued by the IRS; for each Company Benefit Plan with respect to which a Form
5500 has been filed, no material change has occurred with respect to the
matters covered by the most recent Form 5500 since the date thereof;
no Company Benefit Plan provides post-employment welfare (including health,

and is a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against
the Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor
may be brought), and no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could constitute a default on the part of the
Guarantor under such Guaranty. 

  

Section 5.7 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 100
shares, no par value per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Acquisition Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, and it
has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior
to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any
nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

  

Section 5.8 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker or other firm or
person is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in
connection with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Parent or the Guarantor. 

  

Section 5.9 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub or Guarantor is
entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be, assuming (x) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
and Acquisition Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such
conditions, (y) the accuracy as of the Effective Time of the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in _Article IV_ hereof (for such
purposes, such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all
material respects without giving effect to any "knowledge", materiality or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualification or exception), and (z) estimates,
projections or forecasts provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date
hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue
to be reasonable, Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this
_Section 5.9_, the term " _Solvent_ " means, with respect to a particular
date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation (on a consolidated basis) and of each of
them (on a stand alone basis) will exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a
stand alone basis) has not incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as such debts mature and (c) each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a stand-alone
basis) does not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged. For purposes of this
_Section 5.9_, " _debt_ " means any liability on a claim, and " _claim_ "
means any (i) right to payment whether or not such a right is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured and (ii) any
right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives
rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is
reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, secured or unsecured.

Section 5.10 _Parent Ownership of Company Securities_. None of Parent, the
Guarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries has been, at any
time during the three years preceding the date hereof, an "interested
shareholder" of the Company, as defined in Section 7.85 and/or Section 11.75
of the IBCA. 

  

Section 5.11 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that, to their knowledge,
as of the date hereof, they and their Representatives have received access to
such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of
the Company which they and their Representatives, as of the date hereof, have
requested to review, and that they and their Representatives have had
full opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss

with the Merger and Parent and Acquisition Sub are not relying on any
representation or warranty except for those set forth in this Agreement or
the Voting Agreement, (b) no person has been authorized by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective businesses in
connection with the Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must
not be relied upon by Parent or Acquisition Sub as having been authorized by
such person, (c) any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial
information, memorandum, presentation or any other materials or
information regarding the Company provided or addressed to Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any of their Representatives are not and shall not be
deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any such
materials or information is a subject of a representation or warranty set
forth in  _Article IV_ of this Agreement and (d) neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives, nor any
other person, will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation or other obligation of any kind or nature to Parent, Acquisition
Sub or any of their affiliates, stockholders or Representatives resulting from
the distribution of or use by Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
affiliates, stockholders or Representatives of such information, unless any
such materials or information is a subject of a representation or warranty
set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement.

thereunder.

(c) _Cooperation_. The Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cooperate
and consult with each other in preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub
will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall not be required to provide
Parent or Acquisition Sub the opportunity to review or comment on or permit

set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including (i) the obtaining and
maintaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, consents and approvals
from Governmental Authorities or other persons necessary in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with

may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions performed or consummated by such party in

Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, and (iii) the execution

Agreement is executed) make its respective filings, and thereafter make any
other submissions required or advisable under the HSR Act or other Antitrust
Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

take (and to cause their affiliates to take) promptly any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S.
federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets
or businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order, that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Parent will take any and
all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-
action by or consent or approval of the Antitrust Division or other foreign
or U.S. Governmental Authority, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction,
temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and

consummation of the Merger by the Termination Date. 

   

(c) Promptly following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall cooperate
with one another to determine any notices that need to be provided to third
parties, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
third party consents not covered by paragraphs (a) and (b) above that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger as reasonably
determined by Parent; _provided_ that the Company and its subsidiaries shall
not seek any such consent of their respective customers without the
prior consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request
in connection with the preparation of any governmental filings or submissions
and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from or material
communication with a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing
the other party of such inquiry or communication, consulting in advance
before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority,
and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings
or communications between either party and any Governmental Authority with

party consents pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not be considered
a condition to the obligations of the Parent and Acquisition Sub to
consummate the Merger pursuant to _Section 7.2_.

information as Parent may reasonably request regarding the business,
assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of the Company (but not
including access to perform physical or environmental examinations or to take
samples of the soil, ground water, air or products) and, during such period,
furnish in advance to Parent a copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and other document to be filed by it during such period pursuant to
the requirements of federal or state securities laws; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Company shall not be required to provide such access if it
would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other privilege held by the Company or otherwise violate any
applicable Laws. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 6.5_ shall be conducted in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its subsidiaries or create a material risk of damage or destruction to
any property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Any access
to the Companys properties shall be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right
to perform invasive testing.

Section 6.6 _No Solicitation of Competing Proposal._  

   

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company agrees that neither it nor any
subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
encourage (including by way of providing information) any inquiries,
proposals or offers that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Competing Proposal, (ii) participate in any negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any nonpublic information with respect to, any
Competing Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any person with respect
to any Competing Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend any Competing Proposal,
(v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or

Proposal, (vi) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring,

hereunder, or (vii) publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.
The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions
of this  _Section 6.6_, and any violation of the restrictions contained in
this _Section 6.6_ by its board of directors (including any committee
thereof) or its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.6_ by the Company. 

   

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_, if after
the date hereof but prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the
Company receives an unsolicited written Competing Proposal which the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with the
Companys legal and financial advisors constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in
either of clause (x) or (y) below, a Superior Proposal, the Company may take
the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third
party making such Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing
such information, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement (which confidentiality agreement shall contain
terms (including a "standstill") no less favorable to the Company than those
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement) and substantially concurrently
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent to the extent such
information was not previously furnished to Parent and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Competing Proposal, in each case only to the extent that the board of
directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that prior to the Company taking
such actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above, the Company shall
have provided written notice to Parent of such determination of the board of
directors of the Company. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
on a current basis (within no more than 24 hours) of any
material developments in the status and terms of any such Competing Proposal
or inquiry (including whether such Competing Proposal or inquiry has been
withdrawn or rejected and any material change to the terms thereof).

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated

immediately following sentence, neither the board of directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly
propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in any manner, the
Company Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Vote
the board of directors of the Company may effect a Change of Recommendation
if the board of directors of the Company has concluded in good faith after
consultation with the Companys legal and financial advisors that the failure
of the board of directors of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company
shall have first provided three (3) Business Days prior written notice to

negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good
faith with Parent for a period of three (3) Business Days since the delivery
of such notice to amend the terms of this Agreement to address the reasons
for the proposed Change of Recommendation, and (C) if Parent delivers
a written and binding offer to alter the terms of the Agreement during such
three (3) Business Day period, the board of directors of the Company shall
have concluded in good faith after consultation with the Companys legal and
financial advisors that the failure of the board of directors to effect a
Change of Recommendation would still be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law. 

   

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
board of directors of the Company from complying with Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that such Rules
will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to
such Rules would otherwise have under this Agreement; and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the
board of directors of the Company expressly and concurrently reaffirms the
Company Recommendation. 

   

(e) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide proposal (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries) relating to any direct or indirect (i) merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries, whose assets individually or in the
aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries as determined on a book-value
basis; (ii) the acquisition by any person of fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole as
determined on a book-value basis; (iii) the acquisition by any person of
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Common

if consummated would result in any person beneficially owning fifteen percent
(15%) or more of the Common Stock or any class of equity or voting securities
of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its subsidiaries as determined on a book-value basis. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a
written Competing Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of
Competing Proposal increased to fifty (50%)) on terms that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys financial and legal advisors, and taking into account all the
terms of the Competing Proposal (including the conditionality and
the timing), are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Companys stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(taking into account any revised proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section 6.6(c)_ or
_Section 8.1(g)_, as applicable). 

  

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._ 

   

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of any Indemnitee as
provided in the articles or certificates of incorporation or by- laws (or
comparable organization documents) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates or in any indemnification agreement listed in
Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Indemnity Agreements_
") shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and advance expenses (subject to the person to whom expenses are
advanced providing an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification) to,
Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities
as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law and as required by: (A) the Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation or By-laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and (B) any Indemnity Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions referenced in subsections (i)(A) and (B)
above in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
any Indemnitees. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of the Indemnity Agreements. 

   

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.7(a)_, during the
period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries and affiliates will, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent 

 

    ##### 

  

   

such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or
pertains to: (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in
such Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries; or (B) the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any
transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay
such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, in each case, if such Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification or advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the Companys or any of its subsidiarys certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, or other similar governing documents or any applicable
Indemnity Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this _Section 6.7(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Section 6.7(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or
termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation and (ii) the Indemnified Parties as a group shall retain only
one law firm to represent them with respect to each matter. 

   

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension
of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D
andO Insurance_") for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties who are currently
insured by the DandO Insurance, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are, in the aggregate, no
less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, there shall
be no breach of this provision so long as (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date
hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date
hereof, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective
Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with
comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no
less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in each case, in
no event shall Parent and the Surviving Corporation be required to pay an
annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_. The provisions of this _Section
6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.7_. 

   

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or insurance policy or under
any agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of
its subsidiaries. 

   

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section
9.6_ hereof to the contrary, this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with its terms and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees
and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this  _Section
6.7_. 

  

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters; Litigation relating to Merger_.
The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other

investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such

party from any Governmental Authority for any amendment or supplement to any
filing made pursuant to this Agreement or any information required to comply
with any Law applicable to the Merger, (iv) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which it is
aware and which would be reasonably likely to cause (x) any representation or
warranty of the notifying party contained in this Agreement to 

 

    #####

condition to closing set forth in  _Article VII_ would, or would reasonably
be expected to, fail to be satisfied or (y) any covenant, condition or
agreement of the notifying party contained in this Agreement not to
be complied with or satisfied such that the applicable condition to closing
set forth in _Article VII_ would, or would reasonably be expected to, fail to
be satisfied, (v) any failure of the notifying party to comply in a timely
manner with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder or (vi) any change, event or effect which
would be reasonably likely to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, on the notifying party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice. In the event of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party shall keep the other party
reasonably informed regarding any such actions, suits, claims, investigations
or proceedings, and each party shall give the other parties hereto the
opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense or settlement of any such
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings and shall give due
consideration to the other partys advice with respect to such actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings. 

  

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with NASDAQ to which Parent or the Company is a party. With respect to any
communications to be delivered orally, including by conference call
or webcast, this _Section 6.9_ shall be deemed satisfied if, to the extent
practicable, the disclosing party gives reasonable advance notice of such
disclosure to the other party, including copies of any talking points,
scripts or similar documents, and consults with the other party and considers
in good faith any comments by such other party with respect thereto;
_provided_ , that the prior agreement of the other party shall be required
with respect to such disclosures to the extent that the non-disclosing party
reasonably determines that any disclosure would be materially averse to the
non-disclosing party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 6.9_ shall not apply to any public statement made
or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with or following a
Change of Recommendation in accordance with  _Section 6.6(c)_. 

  

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters._  

   

(a) During the one-year period commencing on the Effective Date, Parent or
its applicable affiliates shall provide or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide Company Employees compensation and benefits that are,
in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and benefits (other

one-year period shall not be reduced so long as such employee remains
employed after the Effective Time. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this _Section 6.10_, (i) during

any "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) of
Parent or its applicable affiliates, the Company, the Company subsidiaries
and their respective affiliates providing benefits to any Company Employees
after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), and for purposes of accrual of
vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company, the Company subsidiaries and their respective affiliates before
the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and

and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent or its applicable
affiliates shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence

Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New Plan ending on
the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

employment agreements disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or otherwise
disclosed to Parent and all as listed in Section 6.10(d) of the Company

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the occurrence of the Effective Time
shall constitute a "change in control" (or similar phrase) for purposes of
all Company Benefit Plans in which the term is relevant. 

   

(f) No provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the adoption of, or
an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, as that term is defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, or otherwise limit the right of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
such employee benefit plan or the employment of any employee of the Company
or its subsidiaries.

expense, reasonably cooperate on a timely basis in connection with the
arrangement of any debt financing that Parent may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as may be reasonably requested

information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents necessary, proper

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any information utilized
in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and other Representatives), except to the extent such
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses are a result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Company, its subsidiaries or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
Representatives. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with any such debt financing prior to the Effective Time.

limiting any partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties
understand and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement is intended
to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys or its subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective Time and (b)
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent with and

the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act. 

  

Section 6.14 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state "anti-takeover"
or other similar Law (including any "fair price," "business combination,"
"moratorium" or "control share acquisition" statute) is or purports to become
applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub and their respective
boards of directors shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary to ensure that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as reasonably practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate the effect of such Law on

(g) by the Company prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Vote and
subject to the provisions of _Section 6.6_, in order to enter into a
transaction that is a Superior Proposal, if (i) the Companys board of
directors duly authorizes the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a unsolicited written Competing Proposal that did not result
from a breach of any of the provisions of _Section 6.6_, (ii) the board of
directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys legal and financial advisors, that such Competing Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(g)_ would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iii) the Company shall have given
Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of the boards
determination that such Competing Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the
material terms of the Superior Proposal and the Companys intention to

a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (which notice
shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed transaction agreements with
the party making such Superior Proposal (and any other related material
documents)), (iv) if requested by Parent, the Company has negotiated, and
caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, in good faith with
Parent for a period of three (3) Business Days since the delivery of
such notice to amend the terms of this Agreement (it being understood and
agreed that such three (3) Business Day period may be the same three (3)
Business Day period contemplated by  _Section 6.6(c)_), (v) if Parent
delivers a written and binding offer to alter the terms of the Agreement
during such three (3) Business Day period, the board of directors of the
Company shall have concluded in good faith after consultation with the
Companys legal and financial advisors that such Competing Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 8.1(g)_ would still be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (vi) concurrently with or
immediately after any termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ , the
Company enters into the definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_, and any
purported termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ shall be void and of
no force or effect, unless the Company pays to Parent the Company Termination
Fee (as defined in _Section 8.3(a)_) in accordance with _Section 8.3(a)_
prior to or concurrently with such termination pursuant to this  _Section
8.1(g)_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event of any revision to
any financial or other material term of such Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
again comply with the requirements of this _Section 8.1(g)_ with respect to
such new written notice (with the applicable three (3) Business Day period
changed to a two (2) Business Day period in such event). If, within the three
(3) Business Day period following delivery of any such notice, Parent makes
an offer that the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
after consultation with the Companys legal and financial advisors causes
the Competing Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal, then the notice of
intent to terminate pursuant to this _Section 8.1(g)_ shall be deemed
rescinded and of no further force and effect; or 

   

(h) by Parent, if the board of directors of the Company or any committee
thereof shall have effected a Change of Recommendation.

date of such Stockholders Meeting or termination, as the case may be); 

   

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_

Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the
adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger by stockholders of the
Company, there shall not be any amendment that by Law or in accordance with

Company without such further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the
parties hereto.

forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby.

Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article, Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings for this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.
Any statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes. References to a person are also to
its permitted successors and assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$"
refer to currency of the United States of America. 

  

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign
this Agreement to an affiliate thereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, NCO Group, Inc.);  _provided_ that, upon such assignment, Parent shall
remain jointly and severally liable with its applicable affiliate to the
Company and its subsidiaries for performing all of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. 

  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. This Agreement, except for the provisions of _Section 6.7_ hereof
(which upon the Effective Time are intended to benefit the Indemnitees) is
not intended to and shall not confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto rights or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that following
the Effective Time, each holder of Common Stock or Company Options shall be
entitled to enforce the provisions of _Article I_ to the extent necessary to
receive the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Article III. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any
other person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties
hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon
the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether
of the State of Illinois or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Illinois. 

  

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. 

  

The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

sitting in Cook County in the State of Illinois. Each of Parent, Acquisition
Sub and the Company agrees that a non-appealable judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(including by facsimile transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment) in
two (2) or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
