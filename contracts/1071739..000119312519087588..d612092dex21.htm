ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger Sub_.

 

(a) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action by any Party or any other Person (including the Company Stockholders
or the Parent Stockholders):

(i) all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned of record or
Beneficially Owned by Parent, either Merger Sub or the Company (including
shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) immediately prior to the First
Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time (except for shares of Company Common Stock
to be canceled under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ and Appraisal Shares) (each, a
" _Converted Share_ ") shall be (1) automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist and (2) converted into the right to receive (A) subject to _Section_ __
_ 2.3_, 3.38 (such ratio, as may be adjusted under _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock and (B) $120.00 in cash, without interest (such amount of
cash, as may be adjusted under _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, the " _Per-Share
Cash Amount_" and, the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , collectively, the
" _Merger Consideration_ "); and

 

(iii) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub I
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(b) As of the First Effective Time, each holder of (i) a certificate that
immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented any share of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") or (ii) any share of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
cease to have any rights related thereto, except (subject to _Section_ __ _
2.4_) the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to compliance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, any cash in lieu of fractional shares under
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ and any dividends or other distributions payable under
_Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_.

Section 2.2 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if, from the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the First
Effective Time and (b) any termination hereof under _Article VII_ , the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with
a record date within such period, then the Exchange Ratio (and the Per-Share
Cash Amount in the case of any such action related to Company Common Stock)
and

 



4

    

any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock (including Company Equity Awards) the same economic effect as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ prior to such
event. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ shall be construed to permit any
Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision hereof.

 

Section 2.3 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of any Converted Share into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, and such fractional shares shall not
entitle the holder thereof to (a) any whole or fractional share of Parent
Common Stock, (b) vote any whole or fractional share of Parent Common Stock or
(c) any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent, acting as agent for the holders of Converted Shares that
otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_, shall aggregate all fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise have been required to be
distributed under  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ and cause them to be sold on
the NYSE at then-prevailing prices, and each holder of Converted Shares that
otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock under  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_ shall, in lieu thereof, be
entitled to receive from the proceeds from such sales by the Exchange Agent,
rounded to the nearest whole cent and without interest, an amount equal to
such holders proportionate interest in the proceeds of such sales. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Converted Shares in lieu of any fractional share
interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available
such amounts, without interest, to the holders of Converted Shares entitled to
receive such cash.

 

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Shares_. As used herein, " _Appraisal Share_ " means
any share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to
the First Effective Time and that is held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such share of Company Common Stock in
accordance, and who complies in all respects, with Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Section_ __ _ 262_"). At the First Effective Time, (a) by virtue of the
First Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or any other
Person (including the Company Stockholders and the Parent Stockholders), each
Appraisal Share shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and
(b) each holder of an Appraisal Share shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the _fair value_ of such
Appraisal Share under Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if any such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the right to
appraisal under Section 262 for such Appraisal Share, (i) the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such Appraisal Share shall cease, such
Appraisal Share shall cease to be an Appraisal Share and shall be referred to
herein as a " _Subsequently Converted Share_ " and (ii) such Subsequently
Converted Share shall be deemed to be a Converted Share. The Company shall
provide prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served under Section 262\. Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct and control all negotiations and
Actions related to such demands. Prior to the First Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment related to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal under the DGCL or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



5

    

Section 2.5 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary
exchange agent agreement with a financial institution designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

(b) (i) At or prior to the First Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent (1) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock, assuming the effect of _Section_ __ _
2.3_, into which Converted Shares are to be converted under _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(ii)(2)(A)_ and (2) an amount of cash necessary to pay the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)(2)(B)_, and (ii)
after the First Effective Time, on the appropriate payment date, if
applicable, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange
Agent an amount of cash equal to the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable under  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_ on the shares of Parent
Common Stock deposited under the foregoing _clause_ _(1)_ (such shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent under the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If any
Appraisal Share becomes a Subsequently Converted Share, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for addition to the
Exchange Fund, (A) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock, assuming the effect of _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, into which such
Subsequently Converted Shares were converted under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_
and  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, (B) the aggregate amount of cash into which such
Subsequently Converted Shares were converted under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_
and _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and (C) on the appropriate payment date, if
applicable, an amount of cash equal to the amount of any dividends or other
distributions payable under _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_ on the shares of Parent
Common Stock deposited under the foregoing  _clause (A)_. The Parties intend
that the Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to the holders
of Converted Shares and Subsequently Converted Shares out of the Exchange Fund
under the exchange agent agreement contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_.
Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5(i)_, the Parties intend that the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable (and in no event more than five (5) Business Days)
after the First Effective Time, to each holder of record of a Certificate

dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange

escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former
holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Entity free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Entity related to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other distributions that
would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof under _Section_ __ _
2.5(d)_ had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income
or gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Common Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such
investments (net of any losses) shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest, gains
and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Common
Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Article II_. If for any
reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange
Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash
required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

(j) Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person under this Agreement such amounts as required to be deducted and
withheld related to the making of such payment under applicable Law related to
Taxes. Any amount deducted or withheld under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(j)_
shall be treated as having been paid to the Person for which such deduction or
withholding was made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts
so deducted or withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period
required by applicable Law.

Section 2.6 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the First Effective
Time, the Surviving Entity determines that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any right, property or
asset of either of the Company or (if applicable) Merger Sub I acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with,

and the Company shall promptly and jointly prepare an appropriate amendment or

Company Board intends to make a Company Change of Recommendation or authorize
the Company to terminate this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(iii)_ (a

Section 5.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity and its Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company Entities imposed under (i) each indemnification
agreement in effect on the date hereof between any Company Entity and any
Indemnified Person (the " _Company Indemnification Agreements_ ") and (ii)
any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision in the Constituent
Documents of the Company Entities as in effect on the date hereof. The
Constituent Documents of the Surviving Entity and the Surviving
Entitys Subsidiaries shall contain provisions related to indemnification and
exculpation from liability substantially similar to the indemnification and
exculpation from liability provisions in the Constituent Documents of the
Company or its relevant Subsidiaries on the date hereof, and, during the
period commencing at the First Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing Date, such provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnified Person.

(b) During the period commencing at the First Effective Time and ending on
the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity or its applicable Subsidiaries to, indemnify and hold
harmless, and advance expenses to, the Indemnified Persons against any out-of-
pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, or damages in connection with any actual or threatened
Action arising out of or relating to (i) the fact that such Indemnified
Person is or was a director or officer of any Company Entity, (ii) any acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the First Effective
Time in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director or officer of any
Company Entity or (iii) the Mergers, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the foregoing obligation shall not apply to
the Persons and matters listed in _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



77

    

(c) Through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Entity or its applicable Subsidiaries to maintain in
effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons, the current level and
scope of directors and officers liability insurance coverage in the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Surviving Entity be required to expend in any one (1) year an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company related
to such current policy (the " _Annual Cap_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that,
if the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed the Annual
Cap, the Surviving Entity shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost equal to the Annual Cap. In lieu of the obligations in,
and notwithstanding anything in, the immediately preceding sentence, the
Company, in consultation with Parent, may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy
prior to the First Effective Time that provides the Indemnified Persons with
directors and officers liability insurance for a period ending no earlier
than the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that the
premium payable for such "tail" policy shall not exceed the Annual Cap.

shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or Surviving Entity or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity (or
Parent) under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

(e) From and after the Closing, the Indemnified Persons shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, with full rights of enforcement
as if a party hereto. The rights of the Indemnified Persons under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights that any such Indemnified Person may have under the applicable
Constituent Documents or any Company Indemnification Agreement.

(f) Nothing herein is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release,
waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under
any policy that is or has been in existence related to the Company Entities
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section_
__ _ 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 

(g) For purposes hereof, " _Indemnified Person_ " means any Person who is or
was an officer or director of any Company Entity at or at any time prior to
the First Effective Time.

Section 5.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Unless Parent has sufficient cash from other sources (including by reason
of capital markets, securities or other financing transactions that do not
include a provision of the type that would constitute a Prohibited Amendment)
available to satisfy its cash payment obligations under this Agreement, from
and after the execution hereof, Parent shall not agree to nor permit
any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of,
or waiver of any of its rights under, the Commitment Letter without the
Companys prior written

 



78

    

 consent to the extent such termination, amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification or waiver would (i) add new conditions (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent any existing condition) to the consummation or availability
of the Financing as compared to those in the Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof, (ii) reduce the amount of the Financing such that the aggregate funds
that would be available on the Closing Date, together with other immediately
available financial resources of Parent, would not be sufficient to pay the
Required Funding Amount, (iii) adversely affect the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter as so
amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived, relative to
the ability of Parent to enforce their rights against such parties to the
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (iv) reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of
the First Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the foregoing
_clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ , collectively, the " _Prohibited Amendments_
"); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Commitment Letter may be
amended or supplemented to add lenders, lead arrangers, underwriters,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that had not executed
the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Parent shall promptly deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of any amendment, replacement, supplement
or other modification or waiver of the Commitment Letter. Parent shall have
the right to substitute the proceeds of capital markets, securities or other
financing transactions that do not include a provision of the type that would
constitute a Prohibited Amendment for all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter by reducing commitments under the
Commitment Letter. For purposes hereof, (1) the term "Financing" shall be
deemed to include the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as
amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ (including any Alternative Financing), and (2) the term
"Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter as may be
amended, replaced, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and any commitment letters related to any Alternative
Financing.

 

(b) Unless Parent has sufficient cash from other sources (including by reason
of capital markets, securities or other financing transactions that do not
include a Prohibited Amendment) available to satisfy its cash payment
obligations under this Agreement, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
(i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter under its terms until the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements for the Financing on the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Commitment Letter or on other terms agreed by Parent (that
in each case do not include a provision of the type that would constitute a
Prohibited Amendment) and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent,
seek a waiver on a timely basis of) all conditions to funding in the
Commitment Letter that are within its, or its Affiliates, control and, in the
event that all conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter are satisfied at
or prior to Closing, consummate the Financing at the Closing under the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing. Parent
shall give prompt written notice (A) of any breach or default or threatened
breach or default by any party to any Financing, in each case, of which Parent
becomes aware, if such breach or default would reasonably be expected to
result in a material delay of the Closing Date and (B) of the receipt of any
written notice from any Person with respect to any breach or default or
threatened breach, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing.

 



79

    

(c) Unless Parent has sufficient cash from other sources (including by reason
of capital markets, securities or other financing transactions that do not
include a Prohibited Amendment) available to satisfy its cash payment
obligations under this Agreement, in the event any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing (and in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days after becoming aware thereof)
and use reasonable best efforts to arrange alternative financing from the
same or alternative sources in an amount not less than the Required Funding
Amount and otherwise on conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to
Parent than as set forth in the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof
(the " _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be required to obtain financing that includes terms and conditions
materially less favorable (taken as a whole and taking into account any
"market flex" provision) to Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment
of Parent), in each case relative to those in the Financing being replaced.
Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
after becoming aware thereof) provide the Company with a correct and complete
copy of any commitment letter and any related fee letter (or similar
agreements) relating to such Alternative Financing. Upon request, Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed of its efforts to arrange and obtain the
Financing.

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective controlled
Affiliates and Representatives, including legal, Tax, regulatory and
accounting Representatives, to provide, at Parents sole expense, on a timely
basis, all reasonable assistance and cooperation requested by Parent or the
Financing Sources in connection with the Financing (which, for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(d)_, shall include any capital markets equity or
debt financing that does not include a Prohibited Amendment sought by Parent
in connection with the First Merger in replacement of all or any portion of
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter) or other financing by

securities in connection with such Financing (other than any pro
forma financial statements, which shall be the responsibility of Parent, and
projections) (all information required to be delivered under this _clause (i)_
being referred to as " _Required Information_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that all information pursuant to the foregoing clause _(2)_ shall be deemed
to have been delivered, as of any date of determination, if the Company has
complied in all material respects with its obligations under the Exchange Act
to file reports with the SEC as of such date; (ii) participating (including by
making members of senior management, certain representatives and certain non-
legal advisors, in each case with appropriate seniority and expertise,
available to participate) upon reasonable advance notice in a

their reports in any materials relating to the Financing or other financing by
Parent, including SEC filings, prospectuses and offering memoranda that
include or incorporate the Companys consolidated financial information
(including such information regarding any entity recently acquired by the
Company or whose acquisition by the Company is pending) and their reports
thereon and (B) auditors reports and comfort letters (including "negative

assistance, cooperation and updated information required pursuant to this
_clause (xv)_ shall be deemed to have been provided, as of any date of
determination, if the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under the Exchange Act to file reports with the SEC as of such
date).

listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the First
Effective Time, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in
connection therewith, including by providing all information reasonably
requested by Parent in connection therewith. Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions reasonably required to be taken under any
applicable state securities Laws in connection with the Parent Stock
Issuance, except for qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which
Parent is not now so qualified.

(b) Prior to the First Effective Time, upon Parents request, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to be taken

under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12 _Section_ __ _ 16 Matters_. Prior to the First Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any

transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act related to the
Company or shall become subject to such reporting requirements related
to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.13 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year immediately following the First Effective
Time (or if shorter, during the relevant period of employment), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each employee of any Company Entity
who continues to be employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) an annual base salary or wage rate that is
no less favorable than that provided to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (ii) target cash and equity
incentive opportunities that are in the aggregate no less favorable than those
provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the First
Effective Time, (iii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately

less favorable than those that would have been provided to each such

_Section_ __ _ 3.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and designated
thereon as a severance benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement
of the Company.

 



84

    

(b) From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all Company
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the First Effective Time and the Mergers shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control", "change of control" or term of similar import, as
applicable, under such Company Benefit Plans.

(c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under any benefit plans, policies,
programs, contracts, agreements or arrangements of Parent and its Subsidiaries
to the extent such plans provide benefits to any Continuing Employee on or
after the First Effective Time (excluding the Company Benefit Plans) (the "
_New Plans_ "), each such Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company Entities and their
respective predecessors before the First Effective Time, to the same extent
as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the First Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the First Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing service
credit shall not be required to apply (i) to the extent that its application
would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service, (ii) for purposes of eligibility, vesting or benefit accruals under
any defined benefit pension plan and (iii) for purposes of eligibility,
vesting or benefit accruals under any retiree medical or welfare arrangement.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for any New
Plans that are welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained,
sponsored or contributed to by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (" _Parent Welfare Company Benefit Plans_ "), in which
a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the First
Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Entity and their
respective Subsidiaries shall (1) waive all limitations as to eligibility
waiting periods and preexisting and actively at-work conditions, if any,
related to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee (and each covered dependent, spouse or beneficiary) under
any Parent Welfare Company Benefit Plan to the same extent waived or otherwise
satisfied under a comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (2) provide, credit to
each Continuing Employee (and each covered dependent, spouse or beneficiary)
for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
Continuing Employee (or covered dependent, spouse or beneficiary) under the
Company Benefit Plans during the relevant plan year, up to and including the
First Effective Time.

 

(d) If requested by Parent no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing
Date, effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall terminate or
cause the termination of each U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plan
provided to current and former employees of the Company Entities (each, a "
_Company Qualified Plan_ "). In such event, prior to the Closing Date and
thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all
action as may be required, including amendments to a U.S. tax-qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Parent Qualified Plan_ "), to permit each Continuing Employee to
make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in cash or notes (representing plan
loans from the Company Qualified Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributable to such
Continuing Employee from such Company Qualified Plan to the corresponding
Parent Qualified Plan. If the Company Qualified Plan is terminated as
described herein, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate
in a Parent Qualified Plan as of the Closing Date.

 



85

    

(e) To the extent that the First Effective Time occurs (i) in 2019 or (ii)
following the end of the 2019 performance period with respect to the Companys
annual cash incentive plans (each, a " _Company Incentive Plan_ "), but prior
to payment of the bonuses for such 2019 performance period, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay (without proration) to each
Continuing Employee as soon as practicable following the First Effective Time
(but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
First Effective Time), an amount based on the actual level of achievement of
the applicable performance criteria as determined in good faith and consistent
with past practice by the Company Board or a committee thereof (and taking
into account any shortened performance period and the information available
to the Company Board or the applicable committee thereof at the time of such
determination) (each such payment, a " _2019 Bonus_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, any 2019 Bonus payable to any Continuing Employee pursuant to this
provision in excess of the pro-rated amount that would have been payable to
such Continuing Employee with respect to the portion of the 2019 performance
period elapsing prior to the First Effective Time shall be treated as the
payment of post-closing compensation for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 5.13(a)_.
No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the date that the Company
provides its calculations as to the achievement of the performance metrics
applicable to the 2019 Bonuses to the Company Board or a committee thereof,
the Company shall provide such calculations to Parent. The Company shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments or adjustments to such
calculations by Parent prior to providing such calculations to the Company
Board or a committee thereof.

 

(f) In the event that the First Effective Time occurs in 2020, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each Continuing Employee
who remains employed with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates through December 31, 2020, at the same time or times
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation pay annual bonuses in respect of
the 2020 performance period to other similarly situated employees of Parent
or its Subsidiaries, but in no event later than March 15, 2021, a bonus for
the 2020 performance period (the " _2020 Annual Bonus_ ") that is no less than
the sum of (i) the pro-rata portion of 2020 Annual Bonus that such Continuing
Employee would have been entitled to receive under the Company Incentive Plans
determined based on the Continuing Employees target bonus for such 2020
performance period and the number of days elapsed from January 1, 2020 through
the First Effective Time, and (ii) the 2020 Annual Bonus earned by such
Continuing Employee for the period following the First Effective Time through
the remainder of calendar year 2020, based on actual performance as determined
reasonably and in good faith by the Parent Board or a committee thereof based
on actual results (and after giving appropriate effect to the Mergers and
actions taken by Parent in connection therewith that affect the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, if a Continuing Employees employment is terminated
without "Cause" or due to the Continuing Employees resignation with "Good
Reason" (as each term is defined in _Section_ __ _ 5.13(f)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), in each case, after the First Effective Time but prior
to December 31, 2020 (each, a " _Qualifying Termination_ "), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to such Continuing Employee, as
soon as administratively practicable following the date of such Qualifying
Termination (but no later than sixty (60) days after the date of such

 



86

    

 Qualifying Termination), a pro-rated portion of 100% of the target 2020
Annual Bonus applicable to such Continuing Employee, with such proration based
on the relative portion of the 2020 calendar year during which such
Continuing Employee was employed with the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates; _provided_ that the
foregoing treatment upon a Qualifying Termination shall not apply to any
Continuing Employee who is otherwise entitled to a prorated bonus under the
terms of an applicable Company Benefit Plan.

 

(g) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall be treated as an amendment,
establishment or termination of, or undertaking to amend, establish or
terminate, any Benefit Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, contract, agreement or arrangement. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, express or implied,
shall confer upon any Continuing Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof or any other Person, any rights or remedies, including
any right to employment or service or continued employment or service for any
specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever
under this Agreement or a right of any employee or beneficiary of
such Continuing Employee or other Person under a Company Benefit Plan that
such Continuing Employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise
have under the terms of that Company Benefit Plan.

use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Mergers, taken
together, to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code and (ii) not take any action nor fail to take any action if such
action or such failure is intended or is reasonably likely to prevent or
impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. For purposes of allowing
counsel to render any opinions required by applicable Law to be filed
