be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time.  At
the Effective Time, the separate existence of Sub shall cease,
and the Company shall continue as

have been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1 and subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
two business days) following satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (the "Closing Date"), at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Rosenman and Colin
LLP, 575 Madison Avenue, New York, New
York 10022, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing

as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI, Sub shall

the requirements of Subchapter IX of the DGCL
(the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State

the DGCL in connection with the Merger.  The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, or such other time thereafter as is provided in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the "Effective Time").

 

1.4  Effects of the Merger.  The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

1.5  Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws.  (a)
 The certificate of incorporation of Sub which is attached as
Exhibit A hereto, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable law; provided that Article I of
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
be amended by the Certificate of Merger to read as follows: "The name
of the corporation is:  Taco Cabana, Inc."

 

(b)  The by-laws of Sub which are attached as Exhibit B hereto shall
be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

 

1.6  Directors; Officers.  (a)  The directors of Sub
at the Effective Time shall be the directors of

(b)  The officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier
of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as
the case may be. 
 

 

ARTICLE II

 

CANCELLATION OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

 

COMPANY AND PAYMENT WITH RESPECT THERETO

 

2.1  Effect on Capital Stock.  As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on thepart of the holder of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or any shares of capital stock
of Parent or Sub:

 

(a)  Common Stock of Sub.  Each share of common stock, par value
$.0l per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share
of common stock, par value $.0l per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and shall be the only issued
and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b)  Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock.  Each
share of common stock of the Company, par value $.0l
per share ("Company Common Stock"), that is owned by the Company
or by any subsidiary of the Company, together with
the associated Company Rights, and each share of Company Common Stock
that is owned by Parent, Sub or any other subsidiary of
Parent, together with
the associated Company Rights, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration or
other consideration shall be delivered or payable with respect thereto.

 

(c)  Cancellation of Company Common Stock
and Payment with Respect Thereto.  Each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares
to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
and Dissenting Shares), together with
the associated Company Rights, shall be converted into the right
to receive $9.04, payable, without interest, to the holder
of such shares, upon surrender, in the manner provided in
Section 2.2,
of the certificate(s) that formerly evidenced such shares (the "Merger Consideration").
 As of the Effective Time, all such shares
of Company Common Stock, together with
the associated Company Rights, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate previously representing any
such shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, as applicable.

 

(d)  Appraisal Rights.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent provided by the DGCL, Parent will
not make any payment of Merger Consideration with respect
to Company Common Stock held by any person
(a "Dissenting Stockholder") who elects to demand appraisal of
his shares and duly and timely complies with all the provisions of
the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Company Common Stock
to require appraisal of their shares ("Dissenting Shares"), but
such Dissenting Stockholders shall have the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due such Dissenting Stockholders pursuant to the laws of the
State of Delaware.  If, after the Effective Time,
a Dissenting Stockholder withdraws his demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses his right of appraisal, in
any case pursuant to the DGCL, his shares will be deemed
to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c).  The Company will
give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares received by
the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands.
 The Company will not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or enter
into any negotiations or discussions or
a binding settlement agreement or make an offer, written or oral,
to settle, any such demands.

 

2.2  Payment with Respect to Certificates.

 

(a)  Payment Agent.  As of
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent (the "Payment Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for payment in accordance with this Article
II through the Payment Agent, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of all shares
of Company Common Stock (other than shares representing Dissenting Shares
or shares
to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) (such funds deposited with
the Payment Agent, the "Payment Fund").

 

(b)  Payment Procedures.  As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Payment Agent shall mail to each holder
of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") whose shares were cancelled in
the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(c) the following documents: (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to
the Payment Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment with respect thereto.
 Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Payment Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares represented by
such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.  In
the event that a holder has
lost or misplaced a Certificate, an affidavit of
loss thereof (together with an appropriate indemnity and/or bond
if Parent so requires by notice in writing to the holder
of such Certificate) satisfactory in form and substance to
the Company\'s transfer agent
and the Payment Agent shall accompany such letter of transmittal in
lieu of the applicable Certificate.  In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
of the applicable Merger Consideration may be made to a transferee if
the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to
the Payment Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
 Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration with respect thereto as contemplated by
this Section 2.2.  No interest shall accrue or be paid
to any beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock or any
holder of any Certificate with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate.

 

(c)  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  The
Merger Consideration paid with respect to the cancellation of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares
of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time.  If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II, subject to applicable law in the case
of Dissenting Shares.

 

(d)  Termination of Payment Fund.  Any portion of the Payment Fund
which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration.

 

(e)  No Liability.  If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to five (5) years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
the Merger Consideration in respect of
such certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.1(d)(iii)), any
cash or other property payable in respect of such Certificate shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of
any person previously entitled thereto.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Certificate or
the shares represented thereby for
any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate or
the shares represented thereby to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

 

(f)  Investment of Exchange Fund.  The Payment Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent.
 Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall
be paid to Parent.  The Parent shall replace any
net losses incurred by the Payment Fund as a result
of investments made pursuant to this Section 2.2(f).

 

(g)  Withholding Rights.  Parent or the Payment Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Certificates or the shares
of Company Common Stock represented thereby such amounts (if any) as
Parent or the Payment Agent is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or
the Payment Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or
the Payment Agent.

 

(h)  Associated Company Rights.  References in Article II of
this Agreement to Company Common Stock shall include, unless
the context requires otherwise, the associated Company Rights.

 

2.3  Stock Options with Respect to Company Common Stock.

 

 (a)  The Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to
the Company\'s 1990 Stock Option Plan, the Company\'s 1994
Stock Option Plan and the Company\'s 2000
Stock Ownership Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), and
the terms and provisions of any outstanding options to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock not issued under any Company Stock Plan,
to cause the following: (i) all outstanding options to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans
or otherwise (the "Company Stock Options") shall be exercisable in
full immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
all Company Stock Options that are not exercised prior
to the Effective Time will terminate and expire as of
the Effective Time.  The Company shall give written notice
to the holders of all Company Stock Options
of the foregoing, which written notice shall include an offer to pay

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

3.1  Representations and Warranties of the Company.
 The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub that, except
as specifically disclosed in the letter dated the date hereof
and delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with

its incorporation, has all requisite power and authority and
all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as
it is now being conducted and is duly qualified and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties and assets makes such qualification necessary, other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.  As used in this Agreement, (i) any reference to
any event, change or effect being "material" with respect to any
entity means an event, change or effect which
is material in relation to
the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, assets, liabilities, businesses or operations of
such entity and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, and (ii)
the term "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to the Company
or Parent, any change, event or effect shall have occurred or
been threatened that, when taken together with
all other adverse changes, events or effects that have occurred or
been threatened would or would reasonably be expected to (a)
be materially adverse to the business, assets, properties, results
of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of such party
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (b) prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.  The Company has
made available to Parent true and complete copies
of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws and
the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each subsidiary of

the Company is in violation of any provision of
its certificate of incorporation, by-laws
or equivalent organizational documents.

the outstanding capital stock or other equity interests in each
of its subsidiaries free and clear of any
claim, lien, encumbrance, security interest or agreement with respect thereto.
 The Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list
of the Company\'s subsidiaries.  Other than the capital stock
or other interests held by the Company

of any capital stock or any other equity interest of
any such subsidiary, and there are
no agreements, contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by
which any such subsidiary is bound to issue additional shares

There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  (iii) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with respect to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger by the Company, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and compliance of the Company with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, the failure to obtain which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, except for (A) the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (1) a Proxy Statement in definitive form relating to the meeting of the Company\'s stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger and (2) such other filings under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as contemplated by Section 1.1 and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (C) filings pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq National Market, and (D) filings (the "HSR Filings") under the HSR Act.

 

(e)  SEC Documents.  The Company has made available to Parent a true
and complete copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and definitive proxy statement filed
by the Company with the SEC since December 28, 1997 (as
such documents have since the time of
their filing been amended, the "Company SEC Documents"), which
are all the documents (other than preliminary material) that
the Company was required to file with the SEC since such date.  As
of their respective dates, (i) the Company SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and (ii) none
of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
 The financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Documents (including, without limitation, the audited balance sheet
and related statements of operations, stockholders\' equity and cash
flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year
ended January 2, 2000, as audited by Deloitte and Touche
LLP (such balance sheet
and related statements are referred to hereinafter as the "Year-
End Financial Statements"), and the unaudited financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal quarters ended April
 2, 2000 and July 2, 2000, including the balance sheet
of the Company and its subsidiaries dated July 2,

all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, have

on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case
of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at
the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, stockholders\' equity and cash flows for
the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP.  As of July 2,
2000, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries had
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by
GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its subsidiaries (including the notes thereto) and
which were not reflected on the Balance Sheet.  Since July 2,
2000, except as and to the extent set forth
in the Company SEC Documents and
except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and of substantially the
same character, type and magnitude as incurred in
the past, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities of
any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or
would be required by GAAP to be reflected on
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its subsidiaries (including the notes thereto).
 All material agreements, contracts and other documents required to
be filed as exhibits to any of the Company SEC Documents have
been so filed.  No subsidiary of the Company is required to file any
form, report or other document with the SEC.

 

(f)  Information Supplied.  None

or their counsel specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein) will,
at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company and at the time
of the meeting of stockholders to be held in connection with
the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  The
Proxy Statement (except for information concerning Parent
or Sub provided in writing by Parent or Sub
or their counsel specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein) will comply
as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 

(g)  Absence of Certain Changes or Events.  Except as contemplated by
this Agreement or as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or in
the Company SEC Documents, since January 2, 2000, the Company and

Material Adverse Effect on the Company;

each Tax Entity which are (i) shown as due on such
Tax Returns, (ii) otherwise due and payable or (iii) claimed
or asserted by any taxing authority to be due, have been paid, except
for those Taxes being contested in good faith and for

of the Code or any predecessor provisions thereof, or
any similar provision of foreign, state or local law, or has
any ruling request pending with any tax authority.  There are no
tax certiorari proceedings currently pending, tax abatements currently in

(l)  Employee Benefit Plans.
 All employee benefit plans, compensation arrangements and
other benefit arrangements covering employees of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (the "Company Benefit Plans") and
all employee agreements providing compensation, severance or
other benefits to any employee or former employee of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries which are not disclosed in
the Company SEC Documents and which exceed $50,000 per annum are
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter.  True and complete copies
of the Company Benefit Plans have been made available to Parent.  To
the extent applicable, the Company Benefit Plans comply
in all material respects with the requirements of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA"), and the Code,
and any Company Benefit Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a determination letter and, to the knowledge of
the Company, continues to satisfy the requirements for
such qualification.  Neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate of
the Company maintains, contributes to or is obligated to contribute to
or has maintained or contributed or been obligated to contribute to in
the past six (6) years to any benefit plan which is covered by
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or a "multi-
employer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA
or Section 4001(a)(3) of the Code.  No Company Benefit Plan
nor the Company nor any subsidiary has incurred any liability or
penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA
or, to the knowledge of the Company, engaged in any transaction that
would reasonably be expected to result in
any such liability or penalty.  Each Company Benefit Plan
has been maintained and administered in compliance with its terms
and with ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable thereto, except
for such non-compliance which individually or in the aggregate would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  There is no
pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, anticipated, Litigation against or otherwise involving any
of the Company Benefit Plans and no Litigation (excluding claims
for benefits incurred in the ordinary course
of Company Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against
or with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan.
 All contributions required to be made as of the date hereof
to the Company Benefit Plans have been made or provided for.  Except
as described in the Company SEC Documents or as required by
law, neither the Company nor any
of its subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any plan
or arrangement which provides or has any liability to
provide life insurance or medical or
other employee welfare benefits to any employee or
former employee upon
his retirement or termination of employment, and neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries has
ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral
or written form) to any employee or former employee that
such benefits would be provided.  No Company Benefit Plan
is under investigation or audit by either the
United States Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service.
 Except as provided for in this Agreement, the execution of,
and performance of the transactions contemplated in,
this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under
any benefit plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust
or loan that will or may result in
any payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee.  No payment or
benefit which will or may be made by the Company, any of
its subsidiaries or Parent with respect to any employee of the Company
or any of
its subsidiaries will constitute an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 

For purposes of this Agreement "ERISA Affiliate" means any business or
entity which is a member of the same "controlled group
of corporations," under "common control" or

its subsidiaries either own, or have valid leasehold interests in,
and are in possession of, all properties and assets used by them
in the conduct of their business and each such lease is
valid without material default thereunder by the lessee or, to
the Company\'s knowledge, by the lessor.  Neither the Company nor any

  (3) The business of each of the Company, its subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, the Company\'s and its subsidiaries\' franchisees, as presently conducted, does not conflict with and has not been alleged to conflict with any patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.  

 

  (4) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of any of the Intellectual Property Rights or any of the Licensed Rights.

 

  (5) The Company or its subsidiaries have filed all certificates, affidavits and other documents, and taken all other actions necessary to retain their respective title to all their respective trademarks, service marks, patents and other Intellectual Property Rights and Licensed Rights.

not be deemed to occur and the Company Rights will not separate from
the Company Common Stock as a result of the Company entering into
this Agreement or consummating the Merger and/or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any of
 Parent\'s subsidiaries will have any obligations under

any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, the Company will promptly prepare and mail to
its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.  The Company will
not mail any Proxy Statement, or

and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that a party shall
not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the foregoing if
the taking of such action or such compliance or the obtaining of
such consent, authorization, order, approval or exemption is
likely, in such party\'s reasonable opinion, (x) to
be materially burdensome to such party and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole or to impact in a materially adverse manner
the economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so as to render uneconomic the consummation of
the Merger or (y) in the case of the Company, to result in
the imposition of a condition or restriction on
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective subsidiaries of the type referred to
in Section 6.2(d). Each of the Company and

such information which is nonpublic in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of

the other party prior to the date hereof, each of Parent

any broker\'s or finder\'s fee or any other commission or similar fee
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by

the Company\'s agreement with such firm (a copy of which
has been delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the date of
this Agreement), and each party agrees to indemnify the other party
and hold the other party harmless from and against any

first party or its affiliates.

the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in

the Company covered thereby are intended to
be third party beneficiaries under this Section 5.6 and shall have the
right to enforce the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and
the Parent.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for six years
(or such shorter period as Parent maintains similar policies for
the benefit of its directors and officers) from the Effective Time
the current policies of
the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by
the Company (provided that
the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are not materially less advantageous) with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time to the
extent available; provided, however, that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 150% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance, but
in such case shall purchase as much such coverage as possible for
such amount.

 

5.7  Shareholder Lists.  The Company shall promptly upon request
of Parent, or shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly, furnish Parent with mailing labels containing the
names and addresses of all record holders of Company Common Stock

Parent will cooperate with each other with respect to, and endeavor in
good faith to agree in advance upon the method and content of,
all written or oral communications or disclosure to employees of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and

the condition precedent regarding no material adverse changes relating to

the Commitment Letter was not fulfilled or satisfied as a result
of Parent or any of its subsidiaries entering into
an extraordinary transaction prohibited under  Section 4.2(c).

written instrument, whether or not the Merger has been approved by
the stockholders of the Company;

 

(b) by Parent, upon a material breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part
of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if
any representation or warranty of the Company shall

(c) by the Company, upon a material breach

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if any permanent injunction or
action by any Governmental Entity preventing the consummation of

(e) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or prior to June 30, 2001 (or such later date
as may be agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent) (other than
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform its obligations under this Agreement required to
be performed at or prior to the Effective Time);

 

(f) by either Parent or the Company, if any approval of
the stockholders of the Company required for the consummation of
the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure
to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of stockholders or
at any adjournment thereof;

 

(g) by Parent, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have (i) withdrawn, modified or
changed its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated herein in any
manner which is adverse to Parent or Sub or shall have resolved to do
the foregoing; or (ii) approved or have recommended to
the stockholders of the Company a Competing Transaction or
shall have resolved to do the foregoing;

 

(h) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have exercised a
right specified in clause (i) of the third sentence of
Section 4.1(e) with respect to any transaction referred to therein and
shall, directly or through agents
or representatives, continue discussions with
any third party concerning such transaction for more than
21 calendar days after the date of receipt of
such Competing Transaction, or (ii) (x) a tender offer
or exchange offer or a proposal by a third party
to acquire the Company pursuant to
a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, tender
or exchange offer or similar transaction shall
have been commenced or publicly proposed which contains a proposal as
to price (without regard to the specificity of
such price proposal) and (y) the Company shall
not have rejected such proposal within 10 business days
of its commencement or the date
such proposal first becomes publicly disclosed, if sooner.

 

(i) The right of any party hereto
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any
person controlling any such party or any
of their respective officers or directors, whether prior to or
after the execution of this Agreement.

 

7.2  Effect of Termination.  In the event of termination of
this Agreement and abandonment of the Merger by either the Company
or Parent as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith terminate and there shall
be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or
the Company
or their respective officers or directors except with respect
to the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 and Sections 5.5
and 7.3; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of
Section 8.8, nothing herein shall relieve any party of liability for
any breach hereof.

 

7.3  Fees, Expenses and Other Payments.  (a)  Except
as otherwise provided in this Section 7.3, whether or not the Merger
is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, fees
and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants) shall
be borne solely and entirely by the party which has incurred such
costs and expenses (with respect to such party, its "Expenses").

 

(b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall
be terminated pursuant to:

 

  (i) Section 7.1(b) and (x) such termination is the result of material breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained herein and (y) at any time during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending twelve months after the date of termination of this Agreement, a Business Combination (as defined in Section 7.3(e)) involving the Company shall have occurred or the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing for such a Business Combination, which Business Combination contains a proposal as to the price per share which is in excess of the Merger Consideration; 

 

  (ii) Section 7.1(f) because the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall fail to receive the requisite vote for approval and adoption by the stockholders of the Company at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company called to vote thereon, and at the time of such meeting there shall exist a proposal with respect to a Business Combination with respect to the Company which either (x) the Board of Directors of the Company has not publicly opposed or (y) is consummated, or a definitive agreement with respect to which is entered into, at any time during the period commencing on the date hereof and ending twelve months after the date of termination of this Agreement; or

 

  (iii) Section 7.1(g) or Section 7.1(h); then in each such event the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to $4,500,000, plus all of Parent\'s Expenses not to exceed $850,000.

 

(c) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall
be terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b), then the Company shall
pay to Parent an amount equal to Parent\'s Expenses not
to exceed $850,000; provided that the Company shall
not be obligated to make any payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(c)
if the Company shall be obligated to make a payment
to Parent pursuant to Section 7.3(b).

 

(d) Parent agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated solely
as a result of the non-satisfaction or non-fulfillment of
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(g) due to
the lenders described in the Commitment Letter asserting that
the condition precedent regarding no material adverse changes contained in
the Commitment Letter was not fulfilled or satisfied for
any reason other than a material adverse change
in or affecting the business, operations, property, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, then Parent shall
pay to the Company an amount equal to the Company\'s Expenses not
to exceed $850,000.

 

(e) Any payment required to be made pursuant to
Section 7.3(b), Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.3(d) shall be made
as promptly as practicable but not later than five business days
after termination of this Agreement and shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent, except that any payment to be made as the
result of an event described in Section 7.3(b)(i) or clause (y)
of Section7.3(b) (ii) shall be made as promptly as practicable but
not later than five business days after the occurrence of
the Business Combination or the execution of
the definitive agreement providing for a Business Combination.

 

(f) For purposes of this Section 7.3,
the term "Business Combination" shall mean any of
the following involving the Company:
(i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or
similar transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of 20% or more of the assets of the Company and

of the Company whether by tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise.

by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger
by the stockholders of the Company or of Parent, but, after any
such approval, no amendment shall be made which by
law requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval.  This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties hereto.

 

7.5  Extension; Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective Board of Directors, may, to the
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in

power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the

an action inconsistent herewith or failed to
take action consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to

the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached.  It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to
