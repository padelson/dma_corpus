enter into this Agreement, Purchaser has entered into the Commitment Letter
(as defined herein).

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements and
covenants hereinafter set forth, and intending to be legally bound, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

PURCHASE AND SALE

 



 

SECTION 1.01. _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, UMI shall (and UCB shall cause
UMI to) sell, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
purchase, acquire and accept from UMI, the Transferred Share, in each case
free and clear of all Liens (other than transfer restrictions arising under
applicable securities Laws), in exchange for the payment of an amount in cash
(such amount, the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ") equal to (a) $1,230,000,000
(the " _Cash Consideration_ "), _plus_ (b) Estimated Closing Working Capital,
_minus_ (c) $230,000,000 (" _Target Working Capital_ "), payable as set forth
in _Section 2.02(b)_ hereof and subject to adjustment as set forth in
_Section 2.03_ hereof. The purchase and sale of the Transferred Share are
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acquisition_ ".

 



 

SECTION 1.02. _Estimated Closing Working Capital_. At least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, UCB shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement

      
 

 



 

setting forth UCBs good faith estimate of Closing Working Capital (the "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "). Such statement shall be subject to
Purchasers review prior to the Closing, it being understood that UCB shall
consider in good faith any reasonable comments thereto provided by Purchaser
prior to the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 1.03. _Contingent Value_.

 



 

(a) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Commencement Date_ " means the Business Day following the date on which
the FDA Milestone occurs.

 



 

(ii) " _Contingent Payment_ " means, with respect to any Contingent Payment
Period, the amount equal to 50% of Excess Gross Profit for such Contingent
Payment Period.

 



 

(iii) " _Contingent Payment Period_ " means each of the following periods,
each of which shall be a separate Contingent Payment Period: (A) the period
commencing on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2016; (B) the period
commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2017; (C) the period
commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018; (D) the period
commencing on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2019 and (E) the
period commencing on January 1, 2020 and ending on December 31, 2020;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if the FDA Milestone occurs
after January 1, 2016, the first Contingent Payment Period shall begin on the
Commencement Date and the foregoing definition shall be deemed accordingly
modified (for example, if the Commencement Date were June 1, 2016, clause (A)
would be deemed to provide that the period shall commence on June 1, 2016 and
end on December 31, 2016, and clauses (B) through (E) would remain the same;
or, if the Commencement Date were June 1, 2017, clause (A) would be deemed
deleted, clause (B) would be deemed to provide that the period shall commence
on June 1, 2017 and end on December 31, 2017 and clauses (C) through (E) would
remain the same); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
Contingent Payment Period extend beyond December 31, 2020; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the FDA Milestone does not occur prior to December 31,
2020, there shall be no Contingent Payment Period or Contingent Payment due.
For the avoidance of doubt, negative Gross Profit during any Contingent
Payment Period shall not affect Gross Profit for any other Contingent Payment
Period.

 



 

(iv) " _Excess Gross Profit_ " means, with respect to any Contingent Payment
Period, the greater of (A) zero, and (B) (1) the total amount of Gross Profit
during such Contingent Payment Period, _minus_ (2) the amount of Gross Profit
that is derived from the Threshold Sales during such Contingent Payment
Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(v) " _FDA Milestone_ " means the assignment by the FDA of an AB rating to the
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product), as
evidenced by the listing of an AB rating for the product in the FDAs
electronic publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence
Evaluation" (also known as the Orange Book).

 



 

(vi) " _Final FDA Determination_ " means any final determination by the FDA
(after exhausting the formal dispute resolution process) that the FDA
Milestone will not be achieved.

 



 

(vii) " _Gross Profit_ " means, with respect to any Contingent Payment Period,
(A) the Net Sales of the Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated
Methylphenidate Product), _minus_ (B) the cost of goods sold for the
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) sold
during the Contingent Payment Period, in each case as recorded by Purchaser
(or any applicable affiliate of Purchaser, including the Transferred
Subsidiary) in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and in accordance
with Purchasers allocation procedures and methodologies, consistently applied
with respect to Purchasers products.

 



 

(viii) " _Net Sales_ " means, with respect to any Contingent Payment Period,
the actual gross amounts invoiced by Purchaser or its affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary) on all sales of the
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) in the
United States during such Contingent Payment Period, less deductions actually
allowed for:

 



 

(A) sales and excise taxes, value added taxes, and duties which fall due and
are paid by the purchaser as a direct consequence of such sales and any other
governmental charges imposed upon the use or sale of the Methylphenidate
Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product), but only to the extent
that such taxes and duties are (1) actually included and itemized in the gross
amounts invoiced to and specifically paid by the purchaser over and above the
usual selling price of the Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated
Methylphenidate Product), (2) customarily included and itemized in the gross
amounts invoiced to and specifically paid by the purchaser over and above the
usual selling price of all comparable products in the relevant market, and (3)
are not recovered or recoverable;

 



 

(B) trade, quantity and cash discounts that are customary in the generic
pharmaceutical industry in the United States and that are actually allowed on
the Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product);

 



 

(C) allowances or credits to customers on account of rejection, withdrawal,
recall, or return of the Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated
Methylphenidate Product) or on account of retroactive price reductions
affecting

 



      
 

 



 

the Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product), to
the extent that such allowances or credits are customary in the generic
pharmaceutical industry in the United States and are actually allowed on the
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product); and

 



 

(D) rebates and chargebacks specifically related to the Methylphenidate
Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) on an actual credited or
paid basis, including those granted to Governmental Entities (such rebates and
chargebacks to be accrued as an estimate in the month in which the related
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) is sold
by using GAAP, with reconciliations for actual deductions and credits
performed on a quarterly basis until all such amounts have been finally
reconciled, regardless of the number of calendar quarters such final
reconciliation requires (e.g., amounts accrued for Medicaid rebates in the
third calendar quarter of 2016 may not be finally reconciled until the third
calendar quarter of 2017 or later)).

 



 

Net Sales with respect to sales of the Methylphenidate Product (or any
Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) that are not made on an arms length
basis or that are made for consideration other than cash shall be calculated
based on the average per-unit Net Sales of such Methylphenidate Product (or
any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) during the applicable period without
regard to such non-arms length or non-cash sales. If such Methylphenidate
Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) is sold with other
products on a portfolio basis, any discounts or other adjustments with respect
to such Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product)
shall be allocated pro rata across all products in such portfolio based on the
non-discounted, non-adjusted price for each such product. For purposes of
calculating Net Sales, sales between or among Purchaser and its affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary) shall be excluded
from the computation of Net Sales.

 



 

(ix) " _Reformulated Methylphenidate Product_ " means any methylphenidate
hydrochloride extended-release product that is an AB rated generic of Concerta
for which Purchaser or any of its affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) submits or otherwise becomes the holder of
a new Abbreviated New Drug Application (" _ANDA_ ").

 



 

(x) " _Threshold Sales_ " means, with respect to any Contingent Payment
Period, the first $80 million of Net Sales during such period; _provided_ , if
the first Contingent Payment Period is less than 365 days, the Threshold Sales
for such Contingent Payment Period will equal the product of $80 million and
the fraction, the numerator of which shall equal the number of days in such
Contingent Payment Period, and the denominator of which shall equal 365.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Contingent Payment_. As additional consideration for the Acquisition, if
the Closing occurs, and if and only if the FDA Milestone occurs, Purchaser
shall pay UCB or its designee the Contingent Payment (if any) for each
Contingent Payment Period in accordance with this _Section 1.03_.

 



 

(c) _Contingent Payment Statement_.

 



 

(i) Following the expiration of each Contingent Payment Period, Purchaser
shall calculate the amount of the Contingent Payment in respect of such
Contingent Payment Period, and Purchaser shall, within 60 days following such
expiration, provide to UCB a statement giving notice of Purchasers
calculation of the Contingent Payment (each, a " _Contingent Payment
Statement_ "), together with reasonable supporting detail for such
calculation.

 



 

(ii) Following the delivery of a Contingent Payment Statement to UCB,
Purchaser shall promptly make available to UCB such further information and
access to Purchasers personnel, in each case as may be reasonably requested
by UCB to verify the Contingent Payment Statement. Unless within 30 days after
delivery of such Contingent Payment Statement to UCB, UCB notifies Purchaser
in writing of any dispute relating to the calculation of the Contingent
Payment as set forth in the Contingent Payment Statement, specifying each item
in the calculation that UCB disputes and the amount in dispute with respect to
each item (the " _Contingent Payment Notice of Dispute_ "), the Contingent
Payment Statement delivered by Purchaser shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto.

 



 

(iii) If UCB delivers a Contingent Payment Notice of Dispute, Purchaser and
UCB shall negotiate in good faith to seek to reach agreement on the items and
amounts identified in the Contingent Payment Notice of Dispute, and, if
Purchaser and UCB reach an agreement in writing on all such items and amounts,
the relevant Contingent Payment Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with
such agreement and the adjusted Contingent Payment Statement shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto.

 



 

(iv) If Purchaser and UCB do not reach agreement on the items and amounts
identified in the Contingent Payment Notice of Dispute within 30 days
following the delivery thereof, either Purchaser or UCB may, by written notice
to the other, require that the items and amounts in dispute be referred to the
Independent Expert for resolution. The Independent Expert shall be engaged as
provided in _Section 2.03(b)_, and the Independent Expert shall be
instructed, pursuant to its engagement letter, (A) to resolve only those
matters set forth in the Contingent Payment Notice of Dispute remaining in
dispute and not to otherwise investigate any matter independently, (B) to
resolve such matters in accordance with this Agreement, and (C) that, if the
Independent Experts resolution of a disputed item or amount is not in
accordance with the position of either Purchaser or UCB, the Independent
Experts resolution shall in no event be in excess of the higher, nor less
than the lower, of the amounts proposed by Purchaser and UCB. The relevant
Contingent Payment Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with the
agreement

 



      
 

 



 

of the parties (to the extent applicable) and the resolution of the disputed
items and amounts by the Independent Expert, and the adjusted Contingent
Payment Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by Purchaser and
UCB.

 



 

(d) _Contingent Payment Settlement_. Within five Business Days after the date
on which the Contingent Payment Statement has become final and binding in
accordance with _Section 1.03(c)_, Purchaser shall pay to UCB or its designee
the Contingent Payment for such Contingent Payment Period, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by
UCB (such designation to be made at least two Business Days prior to the wire
transfer). Any Contingent Payment paid to UCB or its designee shall be deemed
to be an increase to the Purchaser Price.

 



 

(e) _Covenants_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser shall notify UCB promptly of the achievement of the FDA
Milestone or of any determination by any level of the FDA that the FDA
Milestone will not be achieved (including any Final FDA Determination).

 



 

(ii) From and after the Closing until the FDA Milestone is achieved or the FDA
makes any Final FDA Determination,

 



 

(A) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary to:

 



 

(1) use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the FDA Milestone as
promptly as practicable; _provided_ that, for purposes of this clause (1), but
subject to clause (2) below, commercially reasonable efforts shall not require
the Transferred Subsidiary to use any greater efforts than those used prior to
Closing; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing herein shall require Purchaser
or any of its affiliates to reformulate the Methylphenidate Product or
otherwise seek to develop or obtain approval for any Reformulated
Methylphenidate Product;

 



 

(2) exhaust all available formal dispute resolution processes within the FDA
with respect to any Proceeding by the FDA that would reasonably be expected to
result in the FDA Milestone not being achieved;

 



 

(3) notify UCB of any material communications to or from the FDA or any other
applicable Governmental Entity, whether written or oral, relating to the
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product), as soon
as reasonably practicable but in no event later than two Business Days after
delivery or receipt, as applicable, of such communication and, within the same
period, provide UCB with

 



      
 

 



 

copies of any such written communications and written summaries of any such
oral communications;

 



 

(4) consult with (and give reasonable consideration to any comments provided
by) UCB prior to making any material communication to, or responding to any
material communication from, the FDA or any other applicable Governmental
Entity of the type referenced in clause (3) above; and

 



 

(5) otherwise keep UCB reasonably informed on a prompt, routine basis
regarding the status of Purchasers efforts to achieve the FDA Milestone and,
upon request by UCB, promptly make available to UCB such further information
and access to Purchasers personnel, in each case as may be reasonably
requested by UCB in connection therewith.

 



 

(B) Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, UCB shall use its, and shall
cause its affiliates to use their, respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with Purchaser in Purchasers efforts to achieve the FDA
Milestone; _provided_ that, for purposes of this clause (B), commercially
reasonable efforts shall not require UCB to use, or to cause its affiliates to
use, any greater efforts than those used prior to Closing.

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary) not to, from and after the Closing
until December 31, 2020, discontinue the marketing, distribution or sale of
the Methylphenidate Product without the prior written consent of UCB (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except UCBs consent shall
not be required to the extent such discontinuation (A) is required in writing
by the FDA, provided that Purchaser shall have exhausted all available formal
dispute resolution processes within the FDA with respect to such requirement
and challenged any FDA Proceedings to seek withdrawal, (B) results from
Purchasers good faith determination, based on information of which Purchaser
becomes aware following the date hereof, that there is a material safety issue
with respect to the Methylphenidate Product, or (C) results from Purchasers
good faith determination, based on information of which Purchaser becomes
aware following the date hereof, that such discontinuation is necessary to
ensure compliance with applicable legal requirements, provided that prior to
making the determination in clause (B) or (C) or discontinuing the marketing,
distribution or sale of the Methylphenidate Product, Purchaser shall have
first consulted in good faith with (and given reasonable consideration to any
comments and views provided by) UCB.

 



 

(f) _Confidentiality_. Until December 31, 2022, UCB shall, and shall cause its
affiliates to, treat as confidential and safeguard any and all information
provided to UCB pursuant to this _Section 1.03_ to the same degree as if such
information were subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. UCB
acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its affiliates, that
(x) the information provided pursuant to this _Section 1.03_ may contain
material

 



      
 

 



 

non-public information concerning Purchaser and its affiliates, (y) it shall
comply with applicable securities laws regarding the trading of securities of
Purchaser and its affiliates while in possession of any such material non-
public information, including any restrictions imposed by such laws
prohibiting any person who has received any such material non-public
information from purchasing or selling securities of Purchaser and its
affiliates or from communicating such information to any other person under
circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is
likely to purchase or sell such securities and (z) Purchaser is relying upon
UCBs compliance with the obligations under this _Section 1.03_ for purposes
of compliance by Purchaser and its affiliates with Regulation FD promulgated
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (to the extent Purchaser or any
of its affiliates is subject to such regulation).

 



 

(g) _Acknowledgments_. It is acknowledged and agreed that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) there are no assurances that
any Contingent Payments will become payable in accordance with the terms of
this _Section 1.03_, (ii) Purchaser and its affiliates owe no fiduciary duty
to UCB or any of its affiliates, and UCB hereby expressly waives, on behalf of
itself and each of its affiliates, any such fiduciary duty if any such duty
were to exist and (iii) the parties intend those express obligations set forth
in _Section 1.03_ to govern their contractual relationship and to supersede
any standard of efforts that might otherwise apply or be imposed. Any right of
UCB to receive a Contingent Payment is solely a contractual right and is not a
security for purposes of any federal or state securities laws. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (A) the Contingent Payments are an integral part of
the consideration payable to UCB, (B) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, no right to receive a Contingent Payment (or any portion
thereof) may be assigned, sold, exchanged, transferred or otherwise disposed
of other than by operation of law or to any affiliate of UCB (except to the
extent expressly permitted in this _Section 1.03_), and any transfer in
violation of this _Section 1.03(g)_ shall be null and void, (C) the right of
UCB to a Contingent Payment shall not be represented by a certificate or other
instrument, shall not represent an ownership interest in Purchaser or any of
its affiliates and shall not entitle UCB to any rights common to any holder of
the capital stock of Purchaser or any of its affiliates and (D) the right of
UCB to payment of the Contingent Payments shall not bear any interest.

 



 

(h) _Transfer; Assignment_. Purchaser shall and shall cause its affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary) not to transfer,
sell, license, convey or dispose of the Methylphenidate Product (or any
Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) or any rights in or to the
Methylphenidate Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) unless
the transferee, licensee or assignee of the Methylphenidate Product (or any
Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) or rights in or to the Methylphenidate
Product (or any Reformulated Methylphenidate Product) expressly agrees to be
bound by the obligations with respect to the Contingent Payments in this
_Section 1.03_ and Purchaser remains responsible for the payment of the
Contingent Payments.

(b) _Objections; Resolution of Disputes_.

 



 

(i) Unless UCB notifies Purchaser in writing within 60 days (such 60-day
period, the " _Objection Period_ ") after Purchasers delivery of the Working
Capital Statement of any objection to the computation of Closing Working
Capital set forth therein (a " _Notice of Objection_ "), the Working Capital
Statement shall become final and binding. Following the delivery of the
Working Capital Statement and for purposes of UCBs review of the Working
Capital Statement and preparation of any Notice of Objection, Purchaser shall
permit UCB and its Representatives to review the working papers of Purchaser
and its accountants relating to the Working Capital Statement and, at UCBs
request, shall provide UCB and its Representatives (A) any information
relating to the Transferred Subsidiary reasonably requested and (B) reasonable
access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books and
records of and relating to the Transferred Subsidiary (including any taking
and preparing of physical counts of inventory). Any Notice of Objection shall
specify the basis for the objections set forth therein. UCB and Purchaser
acknowledge that the sole purpose of the determination of Closing Working
Capital is to adjust the Cash Consideration so as to reflect the difference
between Closing Working Capital and Target Working Capital.

 



 

(ii) If UCB provides the Notice of Objection to Purchaser within the Objection
Period, Purchaser and UCB shall, during the 30 day period following
Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Objection (such 30-day period, the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve UCBs objections.
During the Resolution Period, Purchaser and its Representatives shall be
permitted to review the working papers of UCB and its accountants relating to
the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor. If Purchaser and UCB are
unable to resolve all such objections within the Resolution Period, the
matters remaining in dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
Limited (or, if such firm declines or is unable to act, to another nationally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and
UCB (such agreed firm being the " _Independent Expert_ ")). The Independent
Expert shall be engaged pursuant to an engagement letter among Purchaser, UCB
and the Independent Expert. The Independent Expert shall be instructed,
pursuant to such engagement letter, to resolve only those matters set forth in
the Notice of Objection remaining in dispute and not to otherwise investigate
any matter independently. Purchaser and the Seller Parties each agree to
furnish to the Independent Expert such individuals and such information, books
and records as may be reasonably required by the Independent Expert to make
its final determination. Purchaser and UCB shall also instruct the Independent
Expert to render its reasoned written

 



       
 

 



 

decision as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30 days from
the date that information related to the unresolved objections was presented
to the Independent Expert by Purchaser and UCB. With respect to each disputed
line item, such decision, if not in accordance with the position of either
Purchaser or UCB, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the
lower, of the amounts advocated by Purchaser in the Working Capital Statement
or UCB in the Notice of Objection with respect to such disputed line item. The
resolution of disputed items by the Independent Expert shall be final and
binding on the parties, and the determination of the Independent Expert shall
constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-appealable and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and UCB. After the final determination of Closing Working Capital,
Purchaser shall have no further right to make any claims against UCB or any of
its affiliates (including UMI) in respect of any element of Closing Working
Capital or any payment made pursuant to _Section 2.03(c)_ hereof.

 



 

(iii) The procedures set forth in this _Section 2.03_ shall be the sole and
exclusive method for resolving any disputes with respect to the computation of
Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(c) _Adjustment Payment_. " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal
to (i) the Cash Consideration, _plus_ (ii) Closing Working Capital, _minus_
(iii) Target Working Capital. Within 10 days after Closing Working Capital has
been finally determined in accordance with _Section 2.03(b)_ hereof, (i) if
the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Adjusted Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall pay to UCB such shortfall, and (ii) if the Estimated Purchase
Price is greater than the Adjusted Purchase Price, UCB shall pay to Purchaser
such excess. Any payment hereunder shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Purchaser
or UCB, as the case may be (such designation to be made at least three
Business Days prior to the date on which such payment is due).

 



 

(d) _Working Capital_. The term " _Working Capital_ " means Current Assets
minus Current Liabilities. The terms " _Current Assets_ " and " _Current
Liabilities_ " mean those consolidated current assets and consolidated current
liabilities, respectively, of the Transferred Subsidiary and Kudco Ireland,
Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of Ireland (" _KI_
"), included in the sample calculation of Working Capital set forth on
_Exhibit B_ attached hereto, in each case, calculated in accordance with the
corresponding line items. Closing Working Capital shall be prepared in the
form of _Exhibit B_ and in accordance with GAAP as applied on a consistent
basis with the Financial Statements (it being understood that in the event of
an inconsistency between GAAP and _Exhibit B_, then GAAP as applied on a
consistent basis with the Financial Statements shall prevail), except that:

 



 

(i) Taxes (including deferred Tax liabilities and deferred Tax assets) shall
not be taken into account in determining Working Capital;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any liability or obligation under or pursuant to the Retention Agreements
or the Kremers Urban 2013 Incentive Plan shall not be taken into account in
determining Working Capital;

 



 

(iii) Indebtedness shall not be taken into account as a Current Liability in
determining Working Capital, except to the extent that such Indebtedness has
not been discharged or paid in full as of the Closing, in which case it shall
be included regardless of whether such Indebtedness is treated as short term
or long term Indebtedness for purposes of GAAP;

 



 

(iv) Transaction Expenses unpaid as of Closing shall be taken into account in
determining Working Capital;

 



 

(v) bank overdrafts shall be taken into account in determining Working
Capital;

 



 

(vi) any impact of changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase
accounting adjustments or other changes arising from or resulting as a
consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be taken into
account in determining Working Capital;

 



 

(vii) current assets and current liabilities owing to and from UCB and
affiliates of UCB to the extent arising out of commercial (rather than
corporate) relationships or services (including those relating to information
technology and insurance) listed on Section 2.03(d)(vii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule (" _Continuing Commercial Arrangements_ ") shall be taken
into account in determining Working Capital; and

 



 

(viii) the items described under the headings "Q4 2010 to Q3 2014 Price
Reporting" and "Payments to 340B Entities" in Section 3.05 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall not be taken into account in determining Working
Capital.

 



 

The Working Capital adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.03(d)_ is
intended to show the change in Working Capital from the Target Working Capital
to the Closing Working Capital, subject to the matters set forth in the
preceding clauses (i) through (viii). Working Capital shall be calculated
without duplication of any assets or liabilities included therein pursuant to
this _Section 2.03(d)_.

 



 

(e) _Post-Closing Books and Records_. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
conduct the business of the Transferred Subsidiary in the ordinary course in a
manner substantially consistent with past practice, and following the Closing,
Purchaser shall not take any action with respect to the accounting books and
records of the Transferred Subsidiary on which the Working

 



      
 

 



 

Capital Statement is to be based for the specific purpose of affecting the
Working Capital Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Working Capital Statement shall not reflect any change in any reserve or
other account existing as of the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date, except as a
result of events occurring after the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date and, in
such event, only in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Transferred Subsidiary.

 



 

SECTION 2.04. _Withholding_. Purchaser (and any other person that has any
withholding obligation with respect to any payment made pursuant to this
Agreement) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Law. If Purchaser (or any other such person) determines that it is required to
deduct or withhold any amount from any payment to be made pursuant to this
Agreement to UCB or any of its affiliates, Purchaser (or such other person)
shall (a) provide reasonable notice to UCB of its intent to withhold such
amount and the basis for withholding and (b) provide a reasonable opportunity
for the recipient of the payment to provide forms or other evidence that would
mitigate, reduce or eliminate such deduction or withholding. UCB and Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all Taxes are
properly deducted and withheld and to mitigate, reduce or eliminate such
deduction or withholding. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

enforceable against it in accordance with its terms subject, as to
enforcement, to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization,
fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors

neither the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Seller Parties
of each Ancillary Agreement to which it will be a party nor the consummation

pursuant to this Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements will, (i) conflict
with or violate its organizational documents, (ii) except as set forth in
Section 3.03(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, conflict with, or result in
any breach of, or constitute a default under, require notice or Consent

Liens or Liens arising from any act of Purchaser or its affiliates) upon the
Transferred Share or the properties or assets of the Transferred Subsidiary or
KI, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), any such items that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the business of the Transferred Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) No consent, approval or authorization (" _Consent_ ") of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any federal, state, local or foreign court of
competent jurisdiction, governmental agency, authority, instrumentality or
regulatory body (a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required to be obtained or

SECTION 3.04. _The Transferred Subsidiary; KI_. (a) Each of the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI is an entity duly incorporated, validly existing and, where
applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Except as set forth in Section 3.04 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, each of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI has full corporate power
and authority and possesses all permits, licenses, registrations,
certifications, franchises, approvals or authorizations from any Governmental
Entity (" _Permits_ ") necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently conducted,
other than such Permits the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have be material to the business of the
Transferred Subsidiary. Each of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI is duly
qualified and, where applicable, in good standing to do business as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is necessary,
except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or, where
applicable, in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have be material to the business of the Transferred
Subsidiary. Prior to the date hereof, complete and correct copies of the
Transferred Subsidiarys and KIs organizational documents have been made
available to Purchaser, and each as so made available is in full force and
effect.

 



 

(b) The Transferred Subsidiary has two authorized shares of common stock, one
of which is issued and outstanding, and there are no other shares of capital
stock or other interests of any type or class of the Transferred Subsidiary
authorized, issued, reserved or outstanding. The Transferred Share is the only
outstanding share of capital stock of the Transferred Subsidiary and has been
validly issued and is fully paid and non-assessable. There are no options,
warrants, securities or instruments convertible into or exchangeable for, or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments relating to, or
obligating any of the Seller Parties or any of their respective affiliates to
issue or sell any shares of, the capital stock of, or any other interest in,
the Transferred Subsidiary, including the Transferred Share (other than this
Agreement).

 



 

(c) KI has 1,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, one of which is issued
and outstanding, and there are no other shares of capital stock or other
interests of any type or class of KI authorized, issued, reserved or
outstanding. The Transferred Subsidiary has good and valid title to the issued
and outstanding share of capital stock of KI, free and clear of any Liens
(other than transfer restrictions arising under applicable securities Laws),
and is the record and the beneficial owner of such share. The outstanding
share of capital stock of KI has been validly issued and is fully paid and
non-assessable. There are no options, warrants, securities or instruments
convertible into or exchangeable for, or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments relating to, or obligating the Transferred
Subsidiary or any of its affiliates to issue or sell any shares of, the
capital stock of, or any other interest in, KI. Other than KI, the Transferred
Subsidiary does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity
interest in any other person.

 



 

SECTION 3.05. _Financial Statements_. (a) Prior to the date hereof, the
following have been made available to Purchaser: (i) the audited consolidated
balance sheets of

 



      
 

 



 

the Transferred Subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the
related audited consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and
statements of cash flows and the report of independent auditors for each of
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December 31,
2012, and the related audited consolidated statements of changes in
stockholders equity as of December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December
31, 2012 (the " _Audited Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Transferred Subsidiary as of June
30, 2015 (such balance sheet, the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet_ "; and such
date, the " _Most Recent Balance Sheet Date_ "), the related unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows for
the six-month period then ended as of the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date (the
" _Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Audited Financial
Statements, the " _Financial Statements_ "). The Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") and on that basis fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position and results of operations and
cash flows of the Transferred Subsidiary and its consolidated subsidiary as of
the dates thereof and for the periods indicated, except for, in the case of
the Unaudited Financial Statements, normal, recurring year-end audit
adjustments, which are not expected to be material individually or in the
aggregate, and the absence of footnotes. The Financial Statements may not
necessarily reflect what the financial position and results of operations and
cash flows of the Transferred Subsidiary would have been had the Transferred
Subsidiary operated independently of UCB as of the dates or for the periods
presented.

 



 

(b) The Transferred Subsidiary has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting controls with respect to its business believed to provide
reasonable assurances that, in all material respects, (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorization,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and (B) to maintain
accountability for items, and (iii) recorded accountability for items is
compared with actual levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences.

 



 

SECTION 3.06. _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations, whether known, unknown, accrued, contingent or otherwise, of the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI other than liabilities or obligations:

 



 

(a) specifically provided for in the Financial Statements or the notes
thereto;

 



 

(b) incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Most Recent Balance
Sheet Date;

(d) set forth in Section 3.06 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) arising under any Contract to which the Transferred Subsidiary or KI is a
party (excluding as a result of breach or default thereunder); or

 



 

(f) which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to be material to the business of the Transferred Subsidiary.

 



 

SECTION 3.07. _Absence of Changes_. From the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date
until the date hereof there has not been a Material Adverse Effect. Except (x)
for matters relating to the process for the sale of the Transferred
Subsidiary, (y) for matters relating to the contemplated liquidation and
dissolution of KI and (z) as set forth in Section 3.07 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, from the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date until the date
hereof, (a) the business of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI have been
conducted in the ordinary course in a manner substantially consistent with
past practice and (b) none of the Seller Parties nor any of their respective
affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) has taken any action
that, if taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a material
breach of any of the covenants set forth in _Section 5.01_ hereof, other than
any actions that are expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.08. _Title to Transferred Share_. UMI has good and valid title to
the Transferred Share, free and clear of any Liens (other than transfer
restrictions arising under applicable securities Laws), and is the record
owner of the Transferred Share. Other than this Agreement, the Transferred
Share is not subject to any voting trust agreement or other Contract
restricting or otherwise relating to the voting, dividend rights or
disposition of the Transferred Share.

 



 

SECTION 3.09. _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) Section 3.09(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth all real
property and interests in real property leased by the Transferred Subsidiary
and KI (each, a " _Leased Real Property_ "). Except as set forth in Section
3.09(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred Subsidiary or
KI has valid leasehold estates or, as the case may be, valid leasehold
interests, in all Leased Real Property.

 



 

(b) Section 3.09(b)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth all real
property and interests in real property owned by the Transferred Subsidiary
and KI (each, an " _Owned Real_ ___Property_ "). Except as set forth in
Section 3.09(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI has good and valid fee simple title to each parcel of Owned
Real Property, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens. To the
Knowledge of UCB, there are no outstanding options or rights of first refusal
to purchase the Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest
therein. As of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
UCB, threatened condemnation proceedings, lawsuits or administrative actions
relating to any parcel of Owned Real Property.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 3.10. _Sufficiency and Condition of Assets_. The properties, rights
and other assets owned by, leased or licensed to or otherwise held for use by
the Transferred Subsidiary or KI, when taken together with any services to be
provided by the Seller Parties or their respective affiliates to Purchaser and
its affiliates pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement:

 



 

(a) are sufficient properties, rights and other assets to carry on the
business of the Transferred Subsidiary immediately after the Closing in the
same manner as it is currently being conducted; and

 



 

(b) constitute all of the material properties, rights and other assets
primarily used or primarily held for use by the Seller Parties and their
respective affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary) in the conduct of
the business of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI as it is currently being
conducted;

 



 

except, in the case of each of clauses (a) and (b) above, (x) for the services
and benefits provided to the Transferred Subsidiary described in _Section
5.06_ hereof, (y) the Retained Names and Marks described in _Section 5.09_
hereof and (z) as set forth in Section 3.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

SECTION 3.11. _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
or as provided in any Contract set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Transferred Subsidiary nor KI has entered
into a Contract (other than any such Contract that has expired or been
terminated) with a third party (i) granting any material license to any
material Subsidiary Intellectual Property to any third party or (ii) pursuant
to which the Transferred Subsidiary or KI is granted a license to material
Intellectual Property owned by a third party that is material to the
businesses of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI, except in the case of both (i)
and (ii), for licenses for commercially available software for an annual fee
of less than $250,000 and licenses granted to distributors, manufacturers or
suppliers, licenses granted in connection with marketing agreements, promotion
agreements, co-promotion agreements, development agreements, manufacturing
agreements, supply agreements, co-branding agreements or other promotional
activities and any other non-exclusive licenses to Intellectual Property
granted to third parties or by third parties in the ordinary course of
business.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the operation of the businesses of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI solely
with respect to Products, as conducted since January 1, 2013 and as currently
conducted, has not been and is not infringing or misappropriating any
Intellectual Property owned by any third party, except for those infringements
or misappropriations which would not reasonably be expected to be material to
the business of the Transferred Subsidiary. Except (i) as set forth in Section
3.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or (ii) that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

expected to be material to the business of the Transferred Subsidiary, no
suit, action or proceeding (each, a " _Proceeding_ ") is pending or, to the
Knowledge of UCB, threatened against the Transferred Subsidiary or KI by any
third party claiming infringement or misappropriation by the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI of Intellectual Property owned or licensed by such third
party. To the Knowledge of UCB, since January 1, 2013, no third party is or
has been infringing or misappropriating any Subsidiary Intellectual Property,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to be material to the business of the Transferred Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

Section 3.11(a) or Section 3.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, to the
Knowledge of UCB, (i) the Transferred Subsidiary or KI is the exclusive owner
of the material Subsidiary Intellectual Property and (ii) the material
Subsidiary Intellectual Property is owned free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens). The Transferred Subsidiary and KI have a practice of
requiring all Non-Senior Management Employees to enter into a form or version
of a Confidentiality, Invention Assignment and Intellectual Property Agreement
(" _C andIP Agreement_") with the Transferred Subsidiary or KI. The current form
of the CandIP Agreement has been made available by UCB to Purchaser. All Non-
Senior Management Employees who have materially contributed to the development
of any material product of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI have entered into
the current form or a prior form of a CandIP Agreement with the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI, except for any failure to enter into any such CandIP Agreement
that would not reasonably be expected to be material to the business of the
Transferred Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the Transferred Subsidiary or KI own, license or otherwise possess the right
to use all Intellectual Property that is necessary for the conduct of the
businesses of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI as currently conducted, except
where the failure to own, license or otherwise possess such rights would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the business of the Transferred
Subsidiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that nothing in this _Section 3.11(d)_ shall be interpreted or
construed as a representation or warranty with respect to whether there has
been or is any infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property,
and that those matters are addressed exclusively in _Section 3.11(b)_ hereof.

 



 

(e) In the event and to the extent UCB and its affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) have access to Trade Secrets included in the
Subsidiary Intellectual Property used in and material to the business of the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI, they have taken commercially reasonable
measures to protect the confidentiality of such Trade Secrets.

 



 

SECTION 3.12. _Contracts_. (a) Section 3.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, as of the date hereof, each of the following unexpired
and unterminated leases, subleases, licenses, bonds, debentures, notes,
mortgages, indentures, guarantees, other agreements or contracts or other
legally binding instruments (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI is a party or to which their properties, assets or rights are
subject

 



      
 

 



 

(other than the licenses to Subsidiary Intellectual Property set forth in
Section 3.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule): any Contract

 



 

(i) the performance of which is reasonably expected to involve annual payments
to or from the Transferred Subsidiary or KI in excess of $2,500,000 and is not
terminable by the Transferred Subsidiary or KI on 90 days notice or less
without premium or penalty (excluding sales orders and purchase orders issued
in the ordinary course of business);

 



 

(ii) with respect to a joint venture, joint development, partnership or other
similar agreement;

 



 

(iii) which limits or purports to limit the ability of the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI to compete in any line of business or with any person or in
any geographic area or during any period of time (other than customary
exclusive distribution agreements for the Products);

 



 

(iv) that grants a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien or a Lien that will be
released as of the Closing) on any material asset of the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI;

 



 

(v) that is a lease of real property;

 



 

(vi) that provides for the sale of any material asset (excluding inventory) of
the Transferred Subsidiary or KI outside the ordinary course of business;

 



 

(vii) under which any person directly or indirectly guarantees any liabilities
or obligations of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI;

 



 

(viii) that evidences Indebtedness, including any Contract under which the

subject of a current favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service indicating that it is so qualified.

Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.04. _Litigation_. There are not any (a) Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its
affiliates or (b) outstanding Judgments against Purchaser or any of its
affiliates that, in any such case, would reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.05. _Availability of Funds_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser has received and accepted the executed debt commitment letter
dated as of September 2, 2015 (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " or the "
_Commitment Letter_ ") from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Royal Bank
of Canada (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") relating to the commitment of the
Lenders to provide debt financing in the aggregate amount set forth therein
(the " _Debt Financing_ " or the " _Financing_ "). A complete and correct copy
of the executed Debt Commitment Letter (including (i) all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and

 



      
 

 



 

amendments thereto and (ii) the associated fee letter and amendments thereto
(the " _Fee Letter_ ") redacted in customary form (including the numerical
fees and other commercially sensitive terms specified therein (which shall
include any price caps and economic flex terms) none of which redactions would
affect the amount, conditionality, enforceability, availability or termination
of the Debt Financing)) has been provided to UCB prior to the date hereof. The
Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified in any respect, no amendment, supplement or modification is
contemplated (other than amendments, supplements or modifications to add or
replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities to the extent permitted under _Section 5.13(a)(i)_), and the
commitments thereunder have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any
respect; _provided_ that the existence or exercise of "market flex" provisions
in the Fee Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an amendment, supplement
or modification to the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(b) The Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to
Purchaser on the terms therein. As of the date hereof, there are no side
letters or other Contracts or arrangements related to the funding of any of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and
the Fee Letter, and other than as expressly set forth in (i) the second
paragraph under clause (b) on Exhibit A to the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii)
Section 2 of Exhibit C to the Debt Commitment Letter, and (iii) Section 10 of
the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no contingencies that would permit the
Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Financing. Purchaser has taken all
actions required to cause the Commitment Letter to be effective.

 



 

(c) The Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter,
shall, together with other sources available to Purchaser, provide Purchaser
with acquisition financing on the Closing Date sufficient for the payment of
the aggregate consideration payable on the Closing Date pursuant to _Article
II_ hereof, the payment of all costs and fees to be borne by Purchaser and its
affiliates in connection with the Acquisition on the Closing Date and to pay
for the Refinancing (as such term is defined in the Commitment Letter).

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter (x) is a legal, valid
and binding obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, each
of the other parties thereto (subject in each case, as to enforcement, to the
Enforceability Exceptions) and (y) in full force and effect. As of the date
hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ hereof, no event, fact or circumstance has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of
Purchaser under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter. Purchaser
has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date of this
Agreement. Purchaser has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by
it contained in the Commitment Letter or that the Financing will not be made
available to Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 4.06. _Solvency_. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to
Purchasers obligation to consummate the Acquisition, and after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Financing and the
payment of the Estimated Purchase Price, any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Commitment Letters, payment of all
amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and
expenses, Purchaser and its subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Subsidiary), on a consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Closing and
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with
respect to any person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such person will, as of
such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such person, as of such date, on
its existing debts (including a reasonable estimate of contingent and other
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date, and (c) such person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

SECTION 4.07. _Securities Act_. The Transferred Share is being acquired for
investment only and not with a view to any public distribution thereof.
Purchaser has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Transferred Share and is capable of bearing the economic
risks of such investment.

 



 

SECTION 4.08. _Brokers and Finders_. There is no investment banker, broker,
finder, financial advisor or other intermediary that has been retained by or
is authorized to act on behalf of Purchaser or any of its affiliates that
might be entitled to any fee or commission in connection with the Acquisition
other than Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, whose fees and
expenses shall be paid by Purchaser or its affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 4.09. _UCB s Representations; Independent Investigation_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, other than the representations and
warranties of UCB specifically contained in _Article III_ hereof, there are
no representations or warranties of any of the Seller Parties or any other
person either expressed, statutory or implied with respect to the Transferred
Subsidiary or KI, including with respect to any of their respective rights or
assets, or the transactions contemplated hereby, individually or collectively.
Purchaser,

 



      
 

 



 

together with and on behalf of its affiliates and Representatives,
specifically disclaims that it or they are relying upon or have relied upon
any such other representations or warranties that may have been made by any
person, and Purchaser, together with and on behalf of its affiliates and
Representatives, acknowledges and agrees that each of the Seller Parties and
their respective affiliates (including, before and after the Closing, the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) have specifically disclaimed and do hereby
specifically disclaim any such other representation or warranty made by any
person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Seller Parties, their respective
affiliates or their respective Representatives makes any representations or
warranties relating to (i) other than to the extent addressed in the
representations and warranties of UCB specifically contained in _Article III_
hereof, the maintenance, repair, condition, design, performance or
marketability of any right or asset of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI,
including with respect to title, validity, enforceability, non-infringement,
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, (ii) the operation of the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI or their business by Purchaser after the Closing
(other than to the extent addressed in the representations and warranties of
UCB in _Section 3.10(a)_) or (iii) the probable success or profitability of
the Transferred Subsidiary or KI or their business after the Closing.

 



 

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that it, its affiliates and their respective
Representatives have been permitted full access to the books and records,
facilities, equipment, personnel, Contracts and other properties and assets of
the Transferred Subsidiary and KI that it, its affiliates and their respective
Representatives have desired or requested to see and review, and that it, its
affiliates and their respective Representatives have had a full opportunity to
meet with the officers and employees of the Seller parties and their
respective affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) to discuss
the Transferred Subsidiary and KI and their business. Except as expressly set
forth in any representation or warranty in _Article III_ hereof or any
certificate delivered by Seller Parties pursuant to this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that no person shall have any claim (whether in
warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability) or
otherwise) or right to indemnification pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof (or
otherwise) with respect to any information, documents or materials made
available or otherwise furnished to or for Purchaser, its affiliates or their
respective Representatives by the Seller Parties, any of their respective
affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary or KI), or any of their
respective Representatives, including any financial projections or other
statements regarding future performance, the Confidential Information
Memorandum regarding, among other things, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI
and their business provided to Purchaser, its affiliates or their respective
Representatives and any other information, documents or material, whether oral
or written, made available to Purchaser, its affiliates or their respective
Representatives in any "data room", management presentation, "break-out"
discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser, its
affiliates or their respective Representatives or otherwise furnished to
Purchaser, its affiliates or their respective Representatives in any form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) Purchaser, its affiliates and their respective Representatives have
received and may continue to receive from the Seller Parties, their respective
affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) and their respective
Representatives certain estimates,

 



      
 

 



 

projections and other forecasts for the Transferred Subsidiary and KI and
certain plan and budget information. Purchaser acknowledges that these
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, and the assumptions on
which they are based, were prepared for specific purposes and may vary
significantly from each other. Further, Purchaser acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets, that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it, its affiliates
or their respective Representatives (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and
budgets) and that Purchaser is not relying on any estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or budgets made available or otherwise furnished by the
Seller Parties, their respective affiliates (including the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI) or their respective Representatives, and Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause its affiliates and their respective Representatives not
to, hold any such person liable with respect thereto (whether in warranty,
contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability) or otherwise);
_provided_ that nothing contained in this clause (c) shall be deemed to
preclude a claim by Purchaser for actual fraud with respect to any
representation or warranty made by UCB in this Agreement.

and its affiliates, on the other

SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information_. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller
Parties shall, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary and KI to, afford to
Purchaser and its accountants, counsel and other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours,
to the properties, books and records of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the reasonableness of such access and requests
shall be determined by taking into account, among other considerations, the
competitive positions of the parties; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that such access does not interfere or disrupt the normal operations of any of
the Seller Parties or any of their respective affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI). Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ or
_Section 5.13(b)_ shall obligate any of the Seller Parties or any of their

Law or any Contract with any other person, (ii) waive any privileges,
including the attorney-client privilege, (iii) share any information which
constitutes trade secrets or other sensitive information, or (iv) cause
significant competitive harm to the Transferred Subsidiary or its business if

each case, UCB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to
Purchaser the requested information in a way that would not result in the
breach, waiver, disclosure or harm contemplated by clauses (i) through (iv),
respectively. Furthermore, in the event that UCB or any of its affiliates, on
the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in any pending or reasonably expected or threatened
Proceeding, nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ or _Section 5.13(b)_
shall obligate any of the Seller Parties or any of their respective affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiary) to share any information that is
reasonably pertinent thereto. Prior to the Closing, when accessing any
properties of any of the Seller Parties or any of their respective affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiary) pursuant to and in accordance with this
_Section 5.02(a)_ or _Section 5.13(b)_, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
affiliates and Representatives to, comply with all safety and security
requirements for such property communicated to Purchaser in writing. Prior to
Closing, Purchaser shall have no right to perform or cause any third party to
perform any environmental assessment (including any Phase I or Phase II
assessment) of any real property currently or formerly owned, leased or
operated by the Transferred Subsidiary or KI. All requests for information
made pursuant to this _Section 5.02(a)_ shall be directed to such person or
persons as may be designated by UCB, and Purchaser shall not directly or
indirectly contact any officer, director, employee, agent or Representative of
any of the Seller Parties, the Transferred Subsidiary or any of their
respective affiliates without the prior approval of such designated person(s).
Neither the auditors and independent accountants of the Seller Parties or
their respective affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary) nor the
auditors and independent accountants of Purchaser and its affiliates shall be
obligated to make any work papers available to any person under this
Agreement, including pursuant to _Section 2.03_ hereof, unless and until such
person has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such auditors or independent accountants. If so reasonably
requested by UCB, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates (as
applicable) to, enter into a

 



      
 

 



 

customary joint defense agreement with UCB or its affiliates with respect to
any information to be provided to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
5.02(a)_ or _Section 5.13(b)_.

 



 

(b) After the Closing Date, Purchaser and each of the Seller Parties shall
grant to the other such access to financial records and other information in
their or the Transferred Subsidiarys or KIs possession related to the
conduct of business of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI and such cooperation
and assistance in each case as shall be reasonably required to enable them to
complete their legal, regulatory, stock exchange and financial reporting
requirements (and the Seller Parties shall not object to the filing with or
furnishing to the SEC or any stock exchange of any reports required by Law or
stock exchange rules or regulations, including without limitation (i) current
reports on Form 8-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, to the extent they contain information to be used in connection with
the Debt Financing that Purchaser reasonably believes is necessary to be
publicly disclosed in order to comply with its obligations under Regulation FD
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii)
any report on Form 8-K or amendment thereto to the extent necessary to comply
with Purchasers obligation to file separate financial information and pro
forma financial information with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary) and
for any other reasonable business purpose, including in respect of litigation
and insurance matters. Purchaser and UCB shall promptly reimburse the other
for such others reasonable out-of-pocket expenses associated with requests
made by such first party under this _Section 5.02(b)_, but no other charges
shall be payable by the requesting party to the other party in connection with
such requests.

 



 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that prior to making any records
available to Purchaser, UCB or its affiliates may redact any portions thereof
that relate solely to UCB or any of its affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI).

 



 

SECTION 5.03. _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it and its
affiliates in connection with the Acquisition and the consummation of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including pursuant to
_Section 5.02(a)_, _Section 5.02(b)_ and _Section 5.13(b)_ hereof
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any non-public information Purchaser
uses to prepare a Form 8-K), is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between Purchaser and UCB (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser acknowledges that
any and all other information provided to it or its any of its affiliates by
UCB, any of its affiliates or their respective Representatives concerning UCB
or any of its affiliates (other than information relating solely to the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.

 



 

(b) For a period of two years following the Closing, the Seller Parties shall,
and shall cause their respective affiliates to, treat as confidential and
shall safeguard any and all

 



       
 

 



 

information, knowledge and data about the Transferred Subsidiary and KI to the
same degree as if such information were subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.04. _Efforts; Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and
Consents_. (a) Each party shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, (i) use
its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities and officials that
may be or become necessary or advisable for its execution and delivery of, and
the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, (ii) cooperate fully with the other party in promptly
seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals and
(iii) provide such other information to any Governmental Entity as such
Governmental Entity may request in connection herewith. Each party hereto, as
applicable, agrees to, and to cause its affiliates to, file promptly (but in
no event later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement) any
Notification and Report Forms and related material required to be filed with
the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting period, and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. Each party hereto, as applicable, agrees to, and to cause its
affiliates to, make as promptly as practicable its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any Foreign Merger Control Law and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Entities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to such Foreign Merger Control Law. Neither UCB, on the one hand, nor
Purchaser, on the other hand, may (or may permit any of their respective
affiliates to), without the consent of the other party, (x) cause any such
filing or submission applicable to it to be withdrawn or refiled for any
reason, including to provide the applicable Governmental Entity with
additional time to review any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (y) consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline
or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental
Entity. Purchaser will pay all fees or make other payments to any Governmental
Entity in order to obtain any such authorizations, consents, orders or
approvals.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Purchasers undertaking pursuant to
_Section 5.04(a)_ hereof, Purchaser agrees to, and to cause its affiliates
to, use its best efforts (and to take any and all steps necessary or advisable
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or
competition Governmental Entity or any other person) so as to enable the
parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date, including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such of its
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired by it pursuant hereto, terminating any existing relationships and
contractual rights and obligations, and the entrance into such other
arrangements, as are necessary or advisable in order to avoid the entry of,
and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction,

 



      
 

 



 

temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use its best efforts to defend
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any person in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order
or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent
the Closing prior to the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that UCB shall,
and shall cause its affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in such
litigation; _provided_ , _further_ , that such litigation in no way limits the
obligation of Purchaser to, or to cause its affiliates to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts (and to take any and all steps necessary to
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law) to close the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the End
Date.

 



 

(c) Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify the other of any communication it or any of its affiliates
receives from any Governmental Entity relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and permit the other to review in advance any
proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Entity. Neither
Purchaser, on the one hand, nor UCB, on the other hand, shall (or permit any
of their respective affiliates to) agree to participate in any communication
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation
(including any settlement of the investigation), litigation or other inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby unless it
consults with the other in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate
at such communication. Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on the other hand,
will, and will cause their respective affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate
fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act. Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on the other
hand, will promptly provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between them or any of their Representatives or
affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such materials
may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Transferred Subsidiary, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns, to the extent that that such
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns are not
governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, enter into any
transaction, or any Contract or other agreement, whether oral or written, to
effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that might
reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time
required, to: (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, or approval under any Foreign Merger Control Law,
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) avoid
the entry of, the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or

 



      
 

 



 

other order that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.05. _Intercompany Accounts; Indebtedness_. All intercompany accounts
as of the Closing Date (other than intercompany accounts for Continuing
Commercial Arrangements) between UCB or its affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI), on the one hand, and the Transferred Subsidiary
or KI, on the other hand, shall be settled in full or, at the option of UCB,
but only to the extent permitted by Law, cancelled, in each case on or prior
to the Closing Date. The Seller Parties shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary
and KI, at the Closing, to have no Indebtedness, other than any intercompany
Indebtedness between the Transferred Subsidiary and KI.

 



 

SECTION 5.06. _Services from Affiliates_. Purchaser acknowledges that the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI currently receive or benefit from certain
administrative and corporate services and benefits provided by UCB or its
affiliates, including information technology, patient or consumer services,

back office services and processing, financial systems, treasury services
(including banking, insurance, administration, taxation, tax preparation and
internal audit), product support services (including product hotline services
for customers to report advents), medical information, pharmacovigilance, risk
management, corporate communications, human resources and personnel services
and travel services. Other than as may be provided pursuant to the terms of
the Transitional Services Agreement, Purchaser further acknowledges that all
such services and benefits shall cease, and any agreement in respect thereof
shall terminate with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary and KI as of the
Closing Date, and thereafter, UCBs and its affiliates sole obligation with
respect to the provision of any services with respect to the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI shall be as set forth in the Transitional Services
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.07. _Publicity_. Other than the press release to be agreed by
Purchaser and UCB to be issued following the execution of this Agreement,
neither of Purchaser, on the one hand, nor UCB, on the other hand, will issue
or permit any of their respective affiliates to issue any press release,
website posting or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other
party, except as may be required by Law or stock exchange rules or regulations
(in which case whichever of Purchaser or its affiliates or UCB or its
affiliates, as applicable, is required to make the release or statement shall
be required, if reasonably practicable, to consult with the other party
(whether or not such other party is named in such release or statement), a
reasonable time prior to its release to allow the other party to comment on
such release or statement in advance of such issuance and, after such release
or statement, shall provide the other party with a copy thereof (or summary
thereof in the case of oral statements)); _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on the other hand, may make external or
internal announcements that are consistent with the parties prior public
disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
Purchaser, based on the advice of its counsel, determines that this Agreement,
or any of the other Ancillary Agreements, must be publicly filed with a

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Entity, then Purchaser, prior to making any such filing, shall
provide UCB and its counsel with a redacted version of this Agreement (and any
other Ancillary Agreement) which it intends to file, and will give due
consideration to any comments provided by UCB or its counsel and use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the confidential treatment by such
Governmental Entity of those sections specified by UCB or its counsel for
redaction and confidentiality.

 



 

SECTION 5.08. _Resignations_. UCB shall cause each director of the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI to resign in such capacity, other than individuals who will
continue to act as employees of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI after the
Closing (unless Purchaser shall request in writing), such resignations to be
effective as of the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 5.09. _Use of Retained Names and Marks; Use of Trademarks by UCB
During Transition Period_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that UCB or its affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) own all right, title and interest in and to the
trademarks, service marks, domain names, social media identifiers, handles and
tags, logos and names set forth in Section 5.09 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, together with all confusingly similar variations and acronyms
thereof and all trademarks, service marks, Internet domain names, logos, trade
names, trade dress, company names, social media identifiers, handles and tags,
and other identifiers of source or goodwill containing, incorporating, based
on or associated with any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Retained
Names and Marks_ "), and that, except as expressly provided below, any and all
right of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI to use the Retained Names and Marks
shall terminate as of the Closing and shall immediately revert to UCB and its
affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary and KI), along with any and
all goodwill associated therewith. Purchaser further acknowledges that it has
no rights or interests, and is not acquiring any rights or interests, directly
or indirectly, through the Transferred Subsidiary or KI or otherwise, to use
the Retained Names and Marks, except as expressly provided herein.

 



 

(b) The Transferred Subsidiary and KI shall, as soon as practicable but in no
event more than 180 days after the Closing Date, cease to use all Existing
Stock; _provided_ , that during such period the Transferred Subsidiary and KI
shall be entitled to use, solely in connection with the operation of the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI as operated immediately prior to the Closing,
all of the Transferred Subsidiarys existing stocks of product labeling,
inserts and packaging, signs, letterheads, invoices, advertisements and
promotional materials and all Internet domain names, website content, other
internet or electronic communications vehicles, inventory and other documents
and materials in existence and used by the Transferred Subsidiary or KI as of
the Closing (collectively, the " _Existing Stock_ "), in each case, containing
the Retained Names and Marks, after which period Purchaser shall cause the
removal or obliteration of all Retained Names and Marks from such Existing
Stock or cease using such Existing Stock (and, in the case of any domain names
or social media identifiers, handles or tags, at UCBs direction, either
relinquish, or transfer to UCB or one of its designated affiliates, each such
domain name or social media identifier, handle or tag and the account
associated therewith); _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

that Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiary and
KI) need not cease using the Existing Stock or remove or obliterate Retained
Names or Marks from Existing Stock that is used solely internally, in
accordance with commercially reasonable and applicable record retention
policies, or archived or maintained due to the requirements of a Governmental
Entity. Upon UCBs request, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI to, promptly execute all assignment, transfer and other
documents, and take all steps, in each case, that UCB believes are necessary
or desirable to confirm, effectuate or otherwise evidence or record UCBs and
its affiliates (excluding, after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and
KI) rights, title and interests in and to, and control over, the Retained
Names and Marks, including the Internet domain names and social media
identifiers, handles and tags incorporating any Retained Names and Marks.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly provided in this _Section 5.09_, no other right to
use the Retained Names and Marks is granted by UCB or any of its affiliates to
Purchaser, its affiliates or, after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary or
KI, whether by implication or otherwise, and nothing hereunder permits
Purchaser, its affiliates or, after the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary or
KI to use the Retained Names and Marks in any manner, other than in connection
with the Existing Stock as set forth in this _Section 5.09_, or to register
or seek to register, or to permit, cause or assist any third party to register
or to seek to register, any of the Retained Names and Marks or any confusingly
similar names or marks in any jurisdiction. Purchaser shall ensure that all
use of the Retained Names and Marks by the Transferred Subsidiary and KI,
after the Closing, as provided in this _Section 5.09_, shall be only with
respect to goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than
the quality of goods and services with respect to which the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI used the Retained Names and Marks prior to the Closing. Any
and all goodwill generated by the use of the Retained Names and Marks,
including under this _Section 5.09_ shall inure solely to the benefit of UCB
and its affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary or KI). In any
event, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its affiliates and, after the
Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI not to, use the Retained Names and
Marks in any manner that may damage or tarnish the reputation of UCB or its
affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary or KI) or the goodwill
associated with the Retained Names and Marks.

 



 

(d) Purchaser agrees that neither UCB nor any of its affiliates shall have any
responsibility for claims by third parties arising out of, or relating to, the
use by the Transferred Subsidiary or KI of any Retained Names and Marks after
the Closing. In addition to any and all other available remedies, subject to
and in accordance with _Article IX_, Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any and all such claims
that may arise out of the use of the Retained Names and Marks (i) by the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this _Section 5.09_, other than such claims that the Retained Names and Marks
infringe the Intellectual Property rights of any third party; or (ii) by
Purchaser or any of its affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) in violation of or outside the scope permitted
by this _Section 5.09_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any
breach or threatened breach of this _Section 5.09_, UCB shall suffer
irreparable harm, and UCB in addition to any other remedies available to it,
(i) shall be entitled to a

 



      
 

 



 

preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order or other equivalent relief
restraining Purchaser and any of its affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) from any such breach or threatened breach
and (ii) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such injunction, order or other relief.

 



 

(e) Purchaser hereby grants to UCB and its affiliates permission to use the
trademarks that are owned by the Transferred Subsidiary or KI during the term
of the Transitional Services Agreement to the extent required by UCB or its
affiliates to provide the services described therein to Purchaser or its
affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 5.10. _Further Action_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement (including _Section 5.04_), each party shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken in an
expeditious manner all actions and to do or cause to be done all things
necessary or appropriate to satisfy the conditions to the Closing, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to comply promptly with
all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its affiliates with
respect to the Closing. In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser agrees,
subject to any overriding obligations of confidentiality, to provide such
evidence as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be
reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought
hereunder. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of the
parties hereto will cooperate with and furnish to the other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

SECTION 5.11. _Seller Guarantees_. Purchaser acknowledges that in the course
of conduct of the Transferred Subsidiarys and KIs business, UCB and its
affiliates have entered into various arrangements (a) in which guarantees,
letters of credit, bonds or similar arrangements were issued by UCB or its
affiliates or (b) in which UCB or its affiliates are the primary obligors on
other Contracts, in any such case to support or facilitate the Transferred
Subsidiarys and KIs business. The arrangements entered into by UCB and its
affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) referred to in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are those set forth on Section 5.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and are hereinafter referred to as the " _Seller
Guarantees_ ". Purchaser agrees that it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain replacement Seller Guarantees, which will be in effect at the
Closing or, in the case of Seller Guarantees described in the foregoing clause
(b), will either terminate the business transactions or programs of the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI supported or facilitated by such Seller
Guarantees or arrange for itself or one of its subsidiaries to be substituted
as the primary obligor thereon as of the Closing through an assumption,
accession, acknowledgement or similar agreement with the beneficiary of the
applicable Seller Guarantee. In the event that for any time Purchaser is
unable to satisfy the terms of the immediately preceding sentence as of the
Closing, subject to and in accordance with _Article IX_, Purchaser shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses incurred
by any of them relating to the Seller Guarantees, and shall not amend, modify
or renew any Contract subject to a Seller Guarantee without the consent of UCB
in its sole discretion.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 5.12. _Supplemental Disclosure_. The Seller Parties may, until the
date that is ten days prior to the Closing Date, deliver to Purchaser
modifications, changes or updates to the Seller Disclosure Schedule in order
to disclose or take into account facts, matters or circumstances which arise
or occur between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date that do not
arise from any breach of any covenant in this Agreement by Seller Parties (a "
_Supplemental Disclosure Matter_ "). No Supplemental Disclosure Matter
provided to Purchaser in accordance with this _Section 5.12_ shall be deemed
to cure any breach of representation, warranty or covenant made in this
Agreement for any purpose, including for purposes of determining whether or
not the conditions to Purchasers obligation to close in _Article VII_ have
been satisfied or whether or not Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_, _provided_ that if any
Supplemental Disclosure Matter would result, either individually or in the
aggregate with all other Supplemental Disclosure Matters, in the failure of
the condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ to be satisfied and Purchaser
waives such failure of condition hereunder, any breach resulting from such
Supplemental Disclosure Matter will be deemed to be cured and will not be
indemnifiable under _Article IX_ hereof.

 



 

SECTION 5.13. _Financing_. (a)

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its affiliates to, use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain the Financing on terms and conditions (including the "market
flex" provisions) no less favorable to Purchaser than the terms contained in
the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter as promptly as practicable (taking
into account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) and shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision under, or any replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter if such
amendment, modification, or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter, (I)
reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount), in a manner that would cause the representation set forth in
_Section 4.05(c)_ to be incorrect, (II) imposes new or additional conditions
or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to the
Financing or (III) would otherwise reasonably be expected to (w) prevent,
materially delay or impair the Closing, (x) make the funding of the Financing
(or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date less
likely to occur, (y) materially adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or (z)
materially adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt,
Purchaser may amend, supplement, modify or replace the Commitment Letter to
add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities, so long as such action would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the Closing or impair the availability of the Debt
Financing and the terms are not less beneficial to Purchaser and its
affiliates, with respect to conditionality or enforcement, than those in the
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement. Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to UCB copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. For purposes of this _Section 5.13_ and _Sections 4.05_ and
_4.06_ hereof, references to "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including any alternate financing
arranged in compliance herewith) as permitted to be amended, modified or
replaced by this _Section 5.13(a)_, and references to "Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this _Section 5.13(a)_.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts (A) to maintain in effect the Commitment Letter
(subject to Purchasers rights to amend, supplement, modify or replace the
Debt Commitment Letter in accordance herewith), (B) to negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on the
terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions) contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable to Purchaser than the
terms and conditions (including "market flex" provisions) contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter), (C) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account
the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period) all conditions to funding in
the Debt Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements that are within the
Purchasers control and consummate the Financing, including using its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the other persons committing
to fund the Financing at the Closing, (D) to enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter and (E) to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall keep UCB informed on
a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing and, upon reasonable request, provide promptly to
UCB copies of the material definitive agreements for the Debt Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give UCB
prompt notice (x) of any breach or default (or any event that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any default or breach) by any party to the Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements relating to the Financing of which Purchaser or any of its
affiliates become aware, (y) of the receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing or any
provisions of the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to
the Financing (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements related to the
Financing, and (z) if at any time for any reason Purchaser believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Financing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days
after the date UCB delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser shall
provide any information reasonably requested by UCB relating to any
circumstance referred to in clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately
preceding sentence. Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in
clauses (x), (y) or (z) of the second preceding sentence, or if any portion of
the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable (including taking into
account the "market flex" provisions) or Purchaser becomes aware of any event
or circumstance that would reasonably be expected to make any portion of the
Debt Financing becoming so unavailable, and such portion is reasonably
required to fund the Estimated Purchase Price and all fees, expenses and other
amounts contemplated to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the Acquisition with terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Purchaser or its affiliates (taking into account the "market
flex" provisions as set forth in the Fee Letter) than the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter, as applicable, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Purchaser shall deliver to UCB
complete and correct copies of all Contracts or other arrangements pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion
of the Debt Financing. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.
Purchaser shall pay in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required
to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter after the date of
this Agreement as they become due.

 



 

(b) Subject to the applicable provisions of _Section 5.02(a)_ and the
remaining provisions of this _Section 5.13_, prior to the Closing, UCB shall,
and shall cause its affiliates to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its and its subsidiaries Representatives to, use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to, at Purchasers sole expense, reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser and its Representatives in connection with
Purchasers arrangement of the Prospective Financing, which cooperation shall
consist of, at the reasonable request of Purchaser: (i) using reasonable
efforts to cause the senior management of the Transferred Subsidiary to be
available, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating

any of the Prospective Financing, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts
to (a) assist with the preparation of investor and rating agency
presentations, lender presentations, a single customary bank information

and/or other similar marketing materials or memoranda in connection with the
Prospective Financing ( _provided_ , that any such memoranda shall not be
issued by UCB or any affiliate thereof, and any disclosure and financial
statements with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary and KI contained therein
shall reflect only Purchaser or its affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) as the obligor), and (b) cooperate with the
Debt Financing Sources and Purchasers due diligence to the extent customary
and reasonable (iii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the Transferred
Subsidiary to execute and deliver any guarantees of the Transferred Subsidiary
and documents incident thereto, any pledge and security documents of the
Transferred Subsidiary, other definitive financing documents of the
Transferred Subsidiary, or other certificates or documents of the Transferred
Subsidiary (including legal opinion back-up certificates) as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser ( _provided_ , that any solvency certificate, including
any solvency certificate in the form contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, shall be executed and delivered solely by Purchaser) and otherwise
facilitating such pledging of collateral and the granting of security
interests in respect of the Prospective Financing; _provided_ , that in each
case, such documents shall be subject to the Closing and shall only be
effective at or after the Closing, (iv) furnishing to Purchaser and its Debt
Financing Sources the Required Information, (v) using commercially reasonable
efforts to take reasonable actions necessary to (A) permit the prospective
lenders involved in the Debt Financing to evaluate the Transferred
Subsidiarys and KIs cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purposes of establishing collateral
arrangements and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing, (vi)
taking all corporate actions with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary
reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Prospective Financing
and to permit the proceeds thereof to be available as of the Closing
(including obtaining and delivering any pay-off letters and other

 



      
 

 



 

cooperation in connection with the repayment or other retirement of existing
indebtedness and the release or termination of any and all related liens), and
(vii) upon Purchasers prior written request, to furnish Purchaser and its
Debt Financing Sources at least five Business Days prior to the Closing with
all documentation or other information relating to the Transferred Subsidiary
or KI required by regulatory authorities with respect to the Debt Financing
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 5.13(b)_ except with respect to customary letters
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or
investors and representation letters required by UCB in connection with the

ongoing operations of UCB or any of its affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI), (2) neither UCB nor any of its
affiliates shall be required to provide any financial statements of the
Transferred Subsidiary other than the Financial Statements or financial
statements and information comprising the Required Information, (3) neither
UCB nor any of its affiliates (excluding, upon and following the Closing, the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) shall have any obligation under any agreement,
certificate, document or instrument proposed by Purchaser under this _Section
5.13(b)_, (4) no obligation of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI under any such
agreement, certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Closing, (5) neither UCB nor any of its affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) shall be required to pay any

not simultaneously reimbursed by Purchaser in connection with the Prospective
Financing prior to the Closing, (6) no person that is a director or officer of

Transferred Subsidiary and KI) shall be required to take any action in such
capacity with respect to the Prospective Financing (or any alternative
financing). Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by UCB, reimburse, or cause
its affiliates to reimburse, UCB for all of UCBs and its affiliates
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by UCB and
its affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary
and KI) in connection with the cooperation to be provided by UCB pursuant to
this _Section 5.13(b)_. Purchaser and its affiliates shall, on a joint and
several basis, indemnify and hold harmless UCB, its affiliates (including,
prior to the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) and their respective
Representatives, in each case, acting on behalf of UCB or its affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) for and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Prospective Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith, except to the extent that any such information has been
provided by UCB or its affiliates.

 



 

(c) UCB shall have the right to consent to the use of its and its affiliates
logos in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing; _provided_
that, Purchaser shall be able to use the name and logos of the Transferred
Subsidiary in connection with the Debt Financing so long as (x) they do not
contain any Retained Names and Marks and (y) UCB reviews and approves of any
such use, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the Financing is subject to the terms of _Section 5.02_ and
_Section 5.03_ and all non-public

 



       
 

 



 

information regarding UCB and its affiliates (including the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI) provided to Purchaser, its affiliates or its
Representatives pursuant to _Section 5.13(b)_ shall be kept confidential by
them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except for disclosure
(a) to potential lenders or investors as required in connection with the
Prospective Financing subject to customary confidentiality provisions and (b)
of Required Information in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the Prospective
Financing. With respect to information disclosed to any rating agency (the "
_Confidential Rating Agency Information_ "), Purchaser shall inform such
rating agency of the confidential nature of the Confidential Rating Agency
Information and mark any such information provided in writing to such rating
agency as "confidential". Purchaser shall be responsible for any breach of
this covenant by any such rating agency.

 



 

(e) From the date on which Purchaser receives the Required Information until
the end of the Marketing Period, UCB shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries
to, supplement the Required Information on a reasonably current basis to the
extent that any such Required Information, to the Knowledge of UCB, is not
Compliant.

 



 

(f) If the Closing Date occurs on or after November 14, 2015, then, prior to
Closing, UCB shall deliver to Purchaser the Updated Interim Financial
Statements. For all purposes hereof, " _Updated Interim Financial Statements_
" means unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the

SECTION 5.14. _Insurance_. UCB shall cause to be maintained through the
Closing the insurance with respect to the Transferred Subsidiary and KI
referred to in _Section 3.24_ or other insurance that provides a comparable
amount of coverage. The coverage under all insurance policies related to the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI and arranged or maintained by UCB or any of its
affiliates is only for the benefit of UCB and such affiliates (including,
prior to the Closing, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI), and not after the
Closing for the benefit of Purchaser or the Transferred Subsidiary or KI;
_provided_ that with respect to any claim or incident that arises or that
relates to the Transferred Subsidiary or KI that is covered by any such
policies that are (a) occurrence-based, upon request from Purchaser, UCB
shall, and shall cause its affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI) to, report such claim or incident to the
appropriate insurer in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
policies, and (b) claims-made, upon request from Purchaser, UCB shall, and
shall cause its affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI) to, report such claim or incident to the appropriate
insurer prior to the Closing in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

the terms and conditions of such policies. In each case of (a) and (b), UCB
shall after Closing include Purchaser on material correspondence relating to
such claim or incident and instruct that any proceeds, net of the reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of recovery of such proceeds, received after
Closing are paid directly to the Transferred Subsidiary or KI in settlement of
any claims or incidents, rather than to UCB or its affiliates, or, if such
proceeds are received by UCB or any of its affiliates after Closing, pay such
proceeds, net of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of recovery
of such proceeds, over to the Transferred Subsidiary or KI, as applicable.
Purchaser shall bear any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable
professional fees) incurred by UCB in connection with making a claim under
such policies for the benefit of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI. As of the
Closing Date, Purchaser agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with
respect to the Transferred Subsidiary and KI covering pre-Closing periods and
agrees not to seek (and to cause the Transferred Subsidiary and KI not to
seek), through any means, to benefit from any of UCBs or its affiliates
insurance policies which may provide coverage for claims relating in any way
to the Transferred Subsidiary or KI except as expressly provided in this
_Section 5.14_.

 



 

SECTION 5.15. _Privileged Matters_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on
the other hand, acknowledge and agree that the information relating to or
arising out of the legal advice or services that have been or will be provided
prior to the Closing Date for the benefit of both (a) UCB and its affiliates
(other than the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) and (b) the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI, shall be subject to a shared privilege between UCB and such
affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiary and KI), on the one hand,
and the Transferred Subsidiary and KI, on the other hand, and UCB and such
affiliates and the Transferred Subsidiary and KI shall have equal right to
assert all such shared privileges in connection with privileged information
under any Law and no such shared privilege may be waived after Closing by (i)
UCB or its affiliates without the prior written consent of Purchaser or the
Transferred Subsidiary or (ii) by the Transferred Subsidiary or KI, Purchaser
or any of their respective affiliates without the prior written consent of
UCB. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and affiliates that, as to
all privileged communications among counsel to UCB (Covington and Burling LLP
and any other counsel to UCB, including internal counsel), UCB and the
Transferred Subsidiary that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, the attorney-client privilege
and the expectation of client confidence belong solely to UCB (and may be
waived or otherwise controlled only by UCB) even if any of such communications
may exist in the Transferred Subsidiarys email or computer systems or in
other documents or records in Transferred Subsidiarys possession at any time.

 



 

SECTION 5.16. _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser and UCB agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, now
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees,
as the case may be, of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI as provided in the
organizational documents of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI or in any

 



      
 

 



 

agreement with the Transferred Subsidiary or KI as in effect on the date
hereof shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary to maintain in effect
until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date any and all exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational

agreements of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI with any of the respective
current or former directors, officers or employees of the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI, in each case in effect as of the date hereof, for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) In the event the Transferred Subsidiary or KI or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
(or engages in any similar transaction) and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI, as applicable,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.16_.

 



 

(d) Following the dissolution of KI (or, if earlier, following the Closing),
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary to, assume all of
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.16_ with respect to the current
or former directors, officers or employees of KI.

 



 

SECTION 5.17. _Asset Transfer_. UCB shall, and shall cause its affiliates to,
at UCBs sole cost and expense, transfer, assign and deliver to the
Transferred Subsidiary prior to the Closing the assets set forth in Section
5.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of _Article III_ hereof,
the representations and warranties of UCB shall be deemed to be made as though
the assets set forth in Section 5.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule were
transferred as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.18. _Seller Retained Materials_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that

nor any of its affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI) shall have any interest therein: (a) all records and
reports prepared or received by UCB, any of its affiliates or Representatives
in connection with the sale of the Transferred Subsidiary and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including all analyses relating to the Transferred
Subsidiary, KI or Purchaser or its affiliates so prepared or received and (b)
all confidentiality agreements with prospective purchasers of the Transferred
Subsidiary or any portion thereof, and all bids and expressions of interest
received from third parties with respect thereto, _provided_ that the rights
to enforce all confidentiality provisions under all such confidentiality
agreements shall be assigned to the Transferred Subsidiary at the Closing. In
addition, subject to _Section 5.03_, UCB shall have the right to retain

 



      
 

 



 

copies of the documents, materials and data relating to the conduct of the
business of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 5.19. _Dissolution of KI_. Prior to the date of this Agreement, UCB
and the Transferred Subsidiary have begun the process of liquidating and
dissolving KI as described on Section 5.19 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the Seller Parties and the
Transferred Subsidiary shall be entitled to take all such actions that are
reasonably necessary or desirable in furtherance of such liquidation and
dissolution; _provided_ , _however_ , that the completion of such liquidation
and dissolution shall not be a condition to the Closing.

Subject to applicable Law, prior to the Closing, the Seller Parties shall, and
shall cause the Transferred Subsidiary to, (a) keep Purchaser reasonably
informed, orally or otherwise, of material actions taken after the date hereof

rating for or the marketing of the Methylphenidate Product and (b) consult

submission to FDA relating to the Methylphenidate Product.

 



 

SECTION 5.21. _Amendments to Certain Affiliate Contracts_. At or prior to
Closing, the Seller Parties shall cause each Contract set forth in Section
5.21 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to be amended to provide for the terms
described with respect to such Contract in Section 5.21 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

SECTION 5.22. _Methylphenidate Product_. UCB shall not, and shall cause its
affiliates not to, from the date hereof until the Closing, discontinue the
marketing, distribution or sale of the Methylphenidate Product without the
prior written consent of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except Purchasers consent shall not be required to
the extent such discontinuation (a) is required in writing by the FDA,
provided that UCB shall have exhausted all available formal dispute resolution
processes within the FDA with respect to such requirement and challenged any
FDA Proceedings to seek withdrawal, (b) results from UCBs good faith
determination, based on information of which UCB becomes aware following the
date hereof, that there is a material safety issue with respect to the
Methylphenidate Product, or (c) results from UCBs good faith determination,
based on information of which UCB becomes aware following the date hereof,
that such discontinuation is necessary to ensure compliance with applicable
legal requirements, provided that prior to making the determination in clause
(b) or (c) or discontinuing the marketing, distribution or sale of the
Methylphenidate Product, UCB shall have first consulted in good faith with
(and given reasonable consideration to any comments and views provided by)
Purchaser.

event within 30 days thereafter, UCB and Purchaser shall each appoint a
transition team to (i) cooperate in good faith to promptly, and in any event

appropriate and permitted under U.S. antitrust or other competition Laws,
begin to implement such plan) for separating the businesses of the Transferred
Subsidiary and KI from the businesses of UCB and its retained affiliates,
including with respect to the transfer of all marketing authorizations for the
Products, so as to minimize the adverse impact of such separation on each
partys businesses and facilitate an orderly transition of the business of the
Transferred Subsidiary and (ii) prepare for, cooperate on and assist with the
transfer from UCB to the Transferred Subsidiary of certain applications, data,
documentation and source code (developed specifically for UCB or the
Transferred Subsidiary), in each case, as agreed by the parties, subject to

ARTICLE VI

 



 

EMPLOYMENT MATTERS

 



 

SECTION 6.01. _Continuing Employment_. Purchaser shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiary to continue the employment immediately following the Closing of
each person who is an Employee of the Transferred Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Closing (a " _Transferred Subsidiary Employee_ "). Such employment
shall be in a position comparable to such Employees position immediately
prior to the Closing (including level of responsibility, compensation,
authority and location) and on the terms set forth in this _Article VI_. In
addition, to the extent not covered by the immediately preceding sentence,
Purchaser shall offer employment with Purchaser or one of its affiliates to
any Transferred Subsidiary Employee who, as of the Closing, is on disability
or other leave of absence, commencing on such date as the Employees
disability or leave of absence ends, provided (subject to applicable Law) the
Employees disability or leave of absence ends within one year following the
Closing Date, in a position that is comparable to such Transferred Subsidiary
Employees position immediately prior to the Closing (including level of
responsibility, compensation, authority and location) on the terms set forth
in this _Article VI_. Each Transferred Subsidiary Employee hired by Purchaser
or one of its affiliates under the preceding sentence shall be referred to as
a " _Delayed Transferred Subsidiary Employee_ ". A Delayed Transferred
Subsidiary Employee shall become a Transferred Subsidiary Employee as of the
commencement of such Delayed Transferred Subsidiary Employees employment with
Purchaser or one of its affiliates. Throughout this Agreement, all references
to events that take place with respect to Transferred Subsidiary Employees as
of the Closing shall take place with respect to any Delayed Transferred
Subsidiary Employee as of such Delayed Transferred Subsidiary Employees
commencement of employment with Purchaser or one of its affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 6.02. _Terms of Employment_.

 



 

(a) During the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided to
each Transferred Subsidiary Employee:

 



 

(i) a base salary or hourly wage, as applicable, that is not less than such
Employees base salary or hourly wage in effect immediately prior to the
Closing (or, in the case of a Delayed Transferred Subsidiary Employee on
disability or other leave of absence immediately prior to the Closing, the
base salary or hourly wage in effect immediately prior to such leave or such
higher rate as required under Law);

 



 

(ii) commission opportunities on the same terms and conditions as provided by
the Transferred Subsidiary or its affiliates immediately before the Closing
Date;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) subject to _Section 6.12_ hereof severance benefits upon an involuntary
termination without cause during such one-year period of not less than two
weeks of base salary per each year of service (taking into account service
with the Transferred Subsidiary and its affiliates prior to Closing), up to a
maximum benefit of 52 weeks of base salary;

 



 

(iv) medical care, dental care and vision benefits that are at least as
favorable to such Employee as those provided to such Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date; and

 



 

(v) employee benefits (other than commission opportunities, severance
benefits, medical care, dental care, vision benefits, annual bonus
opportunities divestiture and other special bonuses) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date, or, if greater, employee benefits
provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees.

 



 

(vi) annual bonus opportunities (other than divestitures and other special
bonuses):

 



 

for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, on the same terms and
conditions as provided by the Transferred Subsidiary or its affiliates
immediately before the Closing Date, subject to reduction for any amount paid
by UCB or its affiliates prior to Closing (and, in any event, at an amount no
less than any amount accrued therefor in Closing Working Capital); and

 



 

provided the Closing occurs in calendar year 2015, for the calendar year
following the year in which the Closing occurs, that are substantially similar
to the annual bonus opportunities provided to such Transferred Subsidiary
Employee immediately before the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 6.03. _401(k) Plan_. (a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser or
one of Purchasers affiliates shall maintain or cause to be maintained a
defined contribution plan that (i) meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of
the Code, and (ii) includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within
the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code (such plan being referred to as the
" _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_").

 



 

(b) Under the terms of the UCB 401(k) Plan, each Transferred Subsidiary
Employee who has an account under the UCB 401(k) Plan shall become fully
vested in his or her account and shall be eligible to receive an immediate
distribution from such UCB 401(k) Plan following the Closing. Effective as of
the Closing, the Purchaser 401(k) Plan shall accept (and shall be amended,
prior to the Closing, to the extent necessary to accept) the rollover of any
"eligible rollover distribution" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of
the Code) from the UCB 401(k) Plan, including plan loans.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 6.04. _Health and Welfare Benefit Plans_. Effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser or one of Purchasers affiliates shall maintain or cause to be
maintained benefit plans to provide medical care, dental care and vision care
for the Transferred Subsidiary Employees (collectively, the " _Purchaser
Health Plans_ "). No waiting period or exclusion from coverage of any pre-
existing medical condition shall apply to the participation of any Transferred
Subsidiary Employee (or dependent thereof) in the Purchaser Health Plans, and
all payments, charges and expenses of such Transferred Subsidiary Employees
(and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the deductible and
out-of-pocket maximums under the UCB Health Plans during the plan year in
which the Closing occurs shall be credited toward any deductible and out-of-
pocket maximum applicable under the Purchaser Health Plans for the plan year
in which the Closing occurs. In addition, to the extent that any Transferred
Subsidiary Employee (or dependent thereof) has begun a course of treatment
with a physician or other service provider who is considered "in-network"
under any UCB Health Plan and such course of treatment is not completed prior
to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for
transition care, whereby such Transferred Subsidiary Employee (or dependent
thereof) may complete the applicable course of treatment with the pre-Closing
physician or other service provider at "in-network" rates.

 



 

SECTION 6.05. _Credit for Service with the Transferred Subsidiary_. Where
applicable, and automatically applicable if required by Law, Purchaser and
Purchasers affiliates shall credit or cause to be credited each Transferred
Subsidiary Employees length of service with the Transferred Subsidiary and
its affiliates for all purposes (such as eligibility, vesting and benefit
accrual, including calculating entitlement to vacation days, sick days and
severance payments) to the same extent such service was recognized under the
plan, program, policy or arrangement of the Transferred Subsidiary or any of
its affiliates (including any severance arrangement described herein) that
most closely resembles that to be offered by Purchaser or one of Purchasers
affiliates.

 



 

SECTION 6.06. _Workers  Compensation_. Following the Closing, the Transferred
Subsidiary shall be responsible for all workers compensation benefits payable
to or on behalf of the Transferred Subsidiary Employees but, with respect to
workers compensation claims arising from events or occurrences that take place
prior to the Closing, only with respect to workers compensation benefit
payments which fall within the deductible in UCBs workers compensation
insurance policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Subsidiarys
payment obligation in respect of workers compensation claims arising from
events or occurrences that take place prior to the Closing pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence shall be limited to the provision for workers
compensation claims in the Most Recent Balance Sheet.

 



 

SECTION 6.07. _Earned Vacation_. Following the Closing, the Transferred
Subsidiary will continue to honor, as to each Transferred Subsidiary Employee
all accrued and unpaid hours of vacation, personal hours or days earned and
sick leave applicable to such Transferred Subsidiary Employee as of the
Closing relating to the period prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for any amount of such accrued and

 



      
 

 



 

unpaid vacation, personal hours and sick leave to the extent not included in
the Closing Working Capital. Purchaser shall permit Transferred Subsidiary
Employees to use all such vacation, personal hours or days and sick leave in
accordance with the policy of UCB as in effect on the Closing Date, to the
extent included in the Closing Working Capital. During the Continuation
Period, each Transferred Subsidiary Employee shall accrue additional vacation,
personal time and sick leave at a rate that is at least equal to the rate at
which such Transferred Subsidiary Employee accrued vacation, personal time and
sick leave under UCBs policies in effect as of the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 6.08. _Education Benefits_. The Transferred Subsidiary will continue
to be responsible for paying benefits earned by Transferred Subsidiary
Employees under the Transferred Subsidiarys education benefit programs for
eligible courses commenced, but not yet completed, as of the Closing Date. To
the extent that any participant has enrolled in a course as of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid benefits to that participant
upon completion of the course, in accordance with the terms of the education
benefit programs, even though reimbursement may not be due until after the
Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 6.09. _WARN Act_. Purchaser and Purchasers affiliates agree to
provide any required notice under the WARN Act, and any similar Law, and to
otherwise comply with the WARN Act and any such other similar Law with respect
to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) or group
termination or similar event affecting Employees (including as a result of the
consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and occurring
from and after the Closing. Neither Purchaser nor any of Purchasers
affiliates shall take any action on or after the Closing Date that would cause
any termination of employment of any Employees by UCB or its affiliates
occurring prior to the Closing to constitute a "plant closing," "mass layoff"
or group termination or similar event under the WARN Act or any similar
federal, state, local or foreign law or regulation, or to create any liability
or penalty to UCB or any of its affiliates for any employment terminations
under Law. UCB shall notify Purchaser of any layoffs of any Employees that
occur during the 90-day period prior to the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 6.10. _Retention Agreements_. The Transferred Subsidiary has entered
into retention agreements set forth on Section 6.10 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Retention Agreements_ ") with certain Employees, copies of
which have been provided to Purchaser. The Retention Agreements provide for a
Retention Bonus (as defined in the Retention Agreements) and a severance
payment. To the extent the Transferred Subsidiary is required to pay, and
pays, a Retention Bonus, in accordance with the terms of any Retention
Agreement, UCB shall reimburse the Transferred Subsidiary therefor promptly
upon receipt of written evidence from Purchaser that the Transferred
Subsidiary has timely and properly made such payment. To the extent the
Transferred Subsidiary or any of its affiliates pays any severance payment
under any Retention Agreement, it is understood that UCB shall not provide any
reimbursement therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 6.11. _Kremers Urban 2013 Incentive Plan_. To the extent the
Transferred Subsidiary is required to pay, and pays, any payment to any
Employee in accordance with the terms of the Kremers Urban 2013 Incentive
Plan, UCB shall reimburse the Transferred Subsidiary therefor within 30 days
of receipt of written evidence from Purchaser that the Transferred Subsidiary
has timely and properly made such payment.

 



 

SECTION 6.12. _Release_. Any payments of severance required to be made by
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 6.02(a)(iii)_ shall be subject to the
condition that the Transferred Subsidiary Employee execute an irrevocable
release in a form reasonably acceptable to UCB, which release will include a
release of claims against UCB and its affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, and employees. Purchaser shall promptly provide to UCB a
copy of each such executed release.

"materiality" or "Purchaser Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers contained

 



      
 

 



 

therein) in all material respects at the Closing as though made as of the
Closing (except, in each case, to the extent that such representation and
warranty speaks only as of a particular date, in which case such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects
as of such particular date) and (ii) the other representations and warranties
of Purchaser (other than those in clause (i) preceding) set forth in this

therein) at the Closing as though made as of the Closing (except, in each
case, to the extent that such representation and warranty speaks only as of a
particular date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such particular date), except where the failure of any of
such representations and warranties of Purchaser to be so true and correct,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. UCB shall have received a certificate,
dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an authorized officer of Purchaser,
as to the satisfaction of the foregoing condition.

 



 

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Purchaser_. Purchaser shall have performed

SECTION 7.04. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither Purchaser, on the
one hand, nor the Seller Parties, on the other hand, may rely on the failure
of any condition set forth in this _Article VII_ to be satisfied if such
failure was caused by such partys or its respective affiliates failure to
act in good faith or to comply with its agreements set forth herein.

(a) by mutual written consent of UCB and Purchaser; or

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by either UCB or Purchaser:

 



 

(i) if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any
non-appealable final order, decree or judgment of any Governmental Entity
having competent jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, the
issuance of such non-appealable final order, decree or judgment; or

 



 

(ii) if the Closing does not occur on or prior to February 2, 2016 (the " _End
Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 8.01(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to any party whose
failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, including the
obligations of Purchaser under _Section 5.04_ hereof, has been the cause of,
or materially contributed to, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on
or before the End Date; or

 



 

(c) by Purchaser if the Seller Parties shall have breached or failed to
perform any of their respective representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)

_7.02_ hereof and (ii) cannot be cured by the Seller Parties by the End Date,
or if capable of being cured, shall not have commenced to have been cured by
the earlier of (A) the 30th day following receipt by the Seller Parties of

7.01_ or _7.03_ hereof not being satisfied (other than those conditions that
(1) by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing or (2) the failure of
which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by the Seller

(i) if Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ if any of the
Seller Parties is then in

 



      
 

 



 

breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
hereunder which breach would result in a condition to Closing set forth in
_Sections 7.01_ or _7.02_ hereof not being satisfied (other than those
conditions that (x) by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing or (y)
the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by
Purchaser of its representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement); or

 



 

(ii) if (A) the Marketing Period has ended, (B) all of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 7.01_ and _7.02_ hereof have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that (1) by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing or
(2) the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach
by Purchaser of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that cannot be cured by Purchaser by the End Date,
or if capable of being cured, shall not have commenced to have been cured by
the earlier of (1) the 30th day following receipt by Purchaser of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform from UCB stating UCBs intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(d)(ii)_ and the
basis for such termination and (2) the End Date), (C) UCB has irrevocably
confirmed by notice to Purchaser that all conditions set forth in _Section

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination by UCB or Purchaser pursuant to _Section
8.01_ hereof, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no
further force and effect (other than the provisions of _Section 5.03(a)_
hereof (Confidentiality), _Section 5.07_ hereof (Publicity), the expense
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of _Section 5.13(b)_ hereof,
this _Article VIII_ (Termination), _Section 11.03_ hereof (Expenses),
_Section 11.04_ hereof (Notices), _Section 11.05_ hereof (Interpretation;
Certain Definitions), _Section 11.10_ hereof (Governing Law), _Section
11.11_ hereof (Jurisdiction), _Section 11.12_ hereof (Service of Process) and
_Section 11.13_ hereof (Waiver of Jury Trial), all of which shall survive
termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the part of
Purchaser or UCB or their respective affiliates or Representatives, except (i)
as liability may exist pursuant to the sections specified in this _Section
8.02(a)_ that survive such termination and (ii) that no such termination shall
relieve any party from any liability arising out of any Willful Breach by such
party of any representation or warranty of such party contained herein or any
covenant or agreement of such party contained herein. " _Willful Breach_ "
means a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, which act or failure to
act constitutes in and of itself a material breach of this Agreement, but only
if the party so acting or failing to act actually knew or reasonably expected
that such deliberate act or deliberate failure to act would cause a material
breach of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as
provided herein (i) Purchaser promptly shall, and shall cause each of its
affiliates and Representatives to, return to UCB or destroy (such destruction
to be confirmed in writing by Purchaser to UCB), all documents and other
material received from UCB or any of its affiliates or Representatives
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof; and (ii) all information
received by Purchaser or its affiliates or Representatives with respect to the
businesses of any of the Seller Parties and their respective affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiary and KI) shall be treated in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE IX

 



 

INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

 



 

SECTION 9.01. _Indemnification by UCB_. Subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 9.04_ hereof, from and after the Closing, UCB shall indemnify
Purchaser and its affiliates and each of their respective officers and
directors (the " _Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, penalties, assessments, costs, fines,
fees or expenses, including reasonable third-party legal fees and expenses in
connection with any Proceeding (collectively, " _Losses_ "), whether or not
resulting from a Third Party Claim, to the extent arising or resulting from
any of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty when made or deemed made by
UCB in _Article III_ of, or the certificate delivered in accordance with
_Section 7.02(a)_ of this Agreement;

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant of the Seller Parties contained in this
Agreement;

 



 

(c) any Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid at or prior to Closing;

 



 

(d) any matter described on Section 9.01(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

 



 

(e) any matter described on Section 9.01(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;

 



 

(f) any matter described on Section 9.01(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule;
and

 



 

(g) any matter described on Section 9.01(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 9.02. _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 9.04_ hereof, from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
indemnify the Seller Parties and their respective affiliates and each of their
respective officers and directors (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and
against any and all Losses, whether or not resulting from a Third Party Claim,
to the extent arising or resulting from any of the following:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty when made or deemed made by
Purchaser in _Article IV_ of, or the certificate delivered in accordance with
_Section 7.03(a)_ of this Agreement; and

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 9.03. _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) _Notice_. If any party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives written
notice of the commencement of any Proceeding or the assertion of any claim by
a third party or the imposition of any penalty or assessment (in each case
other than with respect to Taxes) for which indemnity may be sought under
_Section 9.01_ or _Section 9.02_ hereof (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), and
such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity pursuant to this _Article
IX_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but no later than 30 days after
receiving such notice) provide the other party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
with written notice of such Third Party Claim, stating the nature, basis, the
amount thereof (to the extent known or estimated, which amount shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Third Party Claim), the method of
computation thereof (to the extent known or estimated), any other remedy
sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating thereto, and, to the
extent practicable, any other material details pertaining thereto, along with
copies of the relevant documents evidencing such Third Party Claim and the
basis for indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give
such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(ii) _General Procedures_. With respect to any Third Party Claim other than a
Special Indemnity Claim, the Indemnifying Party will have 45 days from receipt
of any such notice of a Third Party Claim to give notice to the Indemnified
Party whether it is assuming and controlling the defense, appeal or settlement
proceedings thereof with counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choice. If, based
upon the good faith advice of either the Indemnifying Partys or the
Indemnified Partys outside counsel, representation of the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party by separate counsel is necessary to avoid a conflict
of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party (other
than based on their interests as such), then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right, upon notice to Indemnifying Party, to engage separate counsel, and
the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by
the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense,
appeal or settlement proceedings of the Third Party Claim in accordance
herewith, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co- counsel at its
sole cost and expense and participate in (but not control) the defense, appeal
or settlement proceedings of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party
will not admit any liability, file any papers or consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement agreement, compromise or discharge with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not admit to any
wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to settle any Third Party Claim (A) for which it obtains a full release
of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and does not
provide for any relief other than monetary damages less than the Cap or (B) to
which settlement the Indemnified Party consents in writing (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). As to any Third Party
Claim with respect to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume
control of the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the Indemnifying
Party an opportunity to participate in such defense, at the Indemnifying
Partys cost and expense, and will consult with the Indemnifying Party prior
to settling or otherwise disposing of any of the same. The parties will act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with Third Party Claims. The parties will also cooperate in any such defense,
appeal or settlement proceedings, and give each other reasonable access to all
information relevant thereto. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings with respect to a Third
Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or any judgment
that was consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(iii) _Procedures for 9.01(d) Claims_.

 



 

(A) At any time the aggregate Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees and
to which the Purchaser Indemnitees would be (but for the last sentence of
_Section 9.04_ hereof) entitled to be indemnified pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)_ is less than or equal to $15,000,000: With respect to any Third Party
Claim for which indemnity may be sought under Section 9.01(d) (a " _9.01(d)
Claim_"), at the election of Purchaser and subject to the terms of this
_Section 9.03(a)(iii)_, either (x) Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnitee
designated by Purchaser shall control the defense, appeal or settlement
proceedings thereof with counsel of Purchasers choice, or (y) UCB shall
assume and control the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings thereof with
counsel of UCBs choice that is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, provided
that in the case of this clause (y), the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be deemed to be Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees for
purposes of the last sentence of _Section 9.04_ and shall be borne by the
Purchaser Indemnitees to the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees would be
required to bear such Losses under the last sentence of _Section 9.04_.
Purchaser shall promptly reimburse UCB for any such fees and expenses. If
Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnitee controls the defense, appeal or
settlement proceedings, then Purchaser shall have the right to settle any
9.01(d)

 



      
 

 



 

Claim (i) for which it obtains a full release with respect to such 9.01(d)
Claim and does not provide for any relief other than monetary damages less
than $15,000,000 or (ii) to which settlement UCB consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If UCB
controls the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings, then UCB shall have
the right to settle any 9.01(d) Claim (I) for which it obtains a full release
of the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to such 9.01(d) Claim and does not
provide for any relief other than monetary damages or (II) to which settlement
Purchaser consents in writing (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). As to any 9.01(d) Claim with respect to which Purchaser elects to
assume or have any other Purchaser Indemnitee assume control of the defense,
Purchaser will (1) keep UCB reasonably informed on a prompt, routine basis
regarding such 9.01(d) Claim, (2) afford UCB an opportunity to participate in
such defense, at UCBs cost and expense, and (3) consult with UCB prior to
making any significant procedural or strategic decisions, or settling or
otherwise disposing of, any of the same. Any Losses borne by Purchaser under
the last sentence of _Section 9.04_ in connection with a settlement of a
9.01(d) Claim shall be promptly paid, or reimbursed to UCB, as applicable,
upon becoming due and payable.

 



 

(B) If the aggregate Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees and to which
the Purchaser Indemnitees would be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
_Section 9.01(d)_ exceeds $15,000,000 and any 9.01(d) Claim is unresolved,
Purchaser shall notify UCB, and UCB will have 45 days from receipt of such
notice to notify Purchaser that it will assume and control the defense, appeal
or settlement proceedings thereof. So long as UCB has assumed the defense,
appeal or settlement proceedings of the 9.01(d) Claim, (1) the Purchaser
Indemnitees may retain separate co-counsel at their sole cost and expense and
participate in (but not control) the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings
of the 9.01(d) Claim, (2) the Purchaser Indemnitees will not admit any
liability, file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement agreement, compromise or discharge with respect to such
9.01(d) Claim without the prior written consent of UCB, and (3) UCB will not
admit to any wrongdoing by any Purchaser Indemnitee. UCB shall have the right
to settle any such 9.01(d) Claim (x) for which it obtains a full release of
the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to such 9.01(d) Claim and does not
provide for any relief other than monetary damages or (y) to which settlement
Purchaser consents in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). As to any 9.01(d) Claim with respect to which UCB
does not elect to assume control of the defense, (1) Purchaser shall have the
right to settle such 9.01(d) Claim if UCB consents in writing (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (2) Purchaser
will (I) keep UCB reasonably informed on a prompt, routine basis regarding
such 9.01(d) Claim, (II) afford UCB an opportunity to participate in such
defense, at UCBs cost and expense, (III) consult with UCB prior to making any
significant procedural or strategic decisions, or settling or otherwise
disposing of, any of the same.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) _Procedures for Other Special Indemnity Claims_. With respect to any
Third Party Claim (whether commenced prior to, on or after the date hereof)
for which indemnity may be sought under _Section 9.01(e)_, _Section 9.01(f)_
or _Section 9.01(g)_ (an " _Other Special Indemnity Claim_ " and, together
with 9.01(d) Claims, " _Special Indemnity Claims_ "), UCB shall assume and
control (or continue to control, as applicable) the defense, appeal or
settlement proceedings thereof with counsel of UCBs choice. The Purchaser
Indemnitees may retain separate co-counsel at their sole cost and expense and
participate in (but not control) the defense, appeal or settlement proceedings
of the Other Special Indemnity Claims. The Purchaser Indemnitees will not
admit any liability, file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement agreement, compromise or discharge with respect
to any Other Special Indemnity Claim without the prior written consent of UCB,
and UCB will not admit to any wrongdoing by any Purchaser Indemnitee. UCB
shall have the right to settle any Other Special Indemnity Claim (A) for which
it obtains a full release of the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to such
Other Special Indemnity Claim and does not provide for any relief other than
monetary damages or (B) to which settlement Purchaser consents in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(v) _Cooperation for Special Indemnity Claims_. The parties will act in good
faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing with
any Special Indemnity Claim. The parties will also cooperate in any such
defense, appeal or settlement proceedings, and give each other reasonable
access to all information and personnel relevant thereto.

 



 

(vi) _Potential Special Indemnity Claims_.

 



 

(A) _Potential 9.01(d) Claims_. Following the Closing, (i) each of Purchaser,
on the one hand, and UCB, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other
upon becoming aware of any event, state of facts or circumstance that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any potential 9.01(d) Claim (
_provided_ that failure of Purchaser to give such notice will not relieve UCB
from its indemnification obligations hereunder, and such notice shall not,
unless expressly described therein otherwise, constitute a notice of claim for
purposes of _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ or the final proviso of _Section 9.08_),
(ii) neither Purchaser, on the one hand, nor UCB, on the other hand, shall (or
permit any of their respective affiliates to) agree to participate in any
communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such potential
9.01(d) Claim unless it consults with (and gives reasonable consideration to
any comments provided by) the other in advance, and (iii) Purchaser, on the
one hand, and UCB, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective
affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(B) _Potential Claims under Section 9.01(g)_. Following the Closing, (i) each
of Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on the other hand, shall

 



      
 

 



 

promptly notify the other upon becoming aware of any event, state of facts or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any potential
Third Party Claim for which indemnity may be sought under _Section 9.01(g)_ (
_provided_ that failure of Purchaser to give such notice will not relieve UCB
from its indemnification obligations hereunder, and such notice shall not,
unless expressly described therein otherwise, constitute a notice of claim for
purposes of _Section 9.03(a)(i)_ or the final proviso of _Section 9.08_),
(ii) UCB shall control all matters relating to any such potential Third Party
Claim, including any internal investigations or communications with any
Governmental Entity with respect thereto; _provided_ , that UCB shall consult
with (and give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by) Purchaser
in connection therewith, and (iii) Purchaser, on the one hand, and UCB, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to, coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with the foregoing.

 



 

(vii) _Conflicts_. In the event of a conflict between this _Section 9.03(a)_
and any other provision of this Agreement with respect to access to
information or expenses relating to claims for indemnity under _Section 9.01_
or _Section 9.02_, this _Section 9.03(a)_ shall control with respect to such
matters.

 



 

(b) _Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party
written notice of any matter that an Indemnified Party has determined has
given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement,
within 30 days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and the method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give
such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its indemnification
obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

SECTION 9.04. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) UCB shall not have any liability
under _Section 9.01(a)_ hereof (other than for breaches of the Specified
Representations) unless the aggregate liability for Losses suffered by the
Purchaser Indemnitees thereunder exceeds [***], and then only to the extent of
such excess; (b) UCBs aggregate maximum liability under _Section 9.01(a)_
hereof (other than for breaches of the Specified Representations) shall not
exceed [***] (the " _Cap_ "); (c) no party shall have any liability under
_Section 9.01(a)_ or _Section 9.02(a)_ hereof for any individual Loss of
less than [***] and such individual Losses shall not be aggregated for
purposes of the preceding clauses (a) and (b); (d) UCB shall not have any
liability for any otherwise indemnifiable Loss to the extent (x) the matter
giving rise to such Loss had been specifically reserved or provided for in the
Most Recent Balance Sheet or (y) taken into account in the Working Capital
Statement; (e) no party shall have any liability for an otherwise
indemnifiable Loss that is contingent unless and until such contingent Loss
becomes an actual Loss of the Indemnified Party and is due and payable, so
long as the claim for such Loss was

 



       
 

 



 

timely submitted pursuant to the provisions of this _Article IX_; and (f) no
party shall be liable for any otherwise indemnifiable Loss arising out of any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of such party
unless a claim therefor is asserted with specificity and in writing by the
Indemnified Party timely in accordance with _Section 9.08_ hereof, failing
which such claim shall be waived and extinguished. The waiver of any condition
to the Closing based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty or on
the performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement shall be
deemed a waiver of the right to indemnification under this _Article IX_ with
respect to such representation or warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.
Purchasers aggregate maximum liability under _Section 9.02(a)_ hereof (other
than for breaches of the Purchaser Specified Representations) shall not exceed
the Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
UCB shall not have any liability under _Section 9.01(d)_ hereof unless the
aggregate liability for Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees
thereunder exceeds $15,000,000, and then only to the extent of such excess.

 



 

SECTION 9.05. _Calculation of Indemnity Payments_.

 



 

(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
_Article IX_ or _Article X_ hereof shall be net of any amounts recovered by
the Indemnified Party (including under insurance policies) with respect to
such Loss.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of Losses that are the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a
portion of such Losses have been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this _Article IX_, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) (A) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Losses plus (B) the amount received by
the Indemnified Party in respect thereof over (ii) the full amount of the
Losses. In the event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third
party with respect to any Loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying
Party under this _Article IX_, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
such rights to the extent of such payment. Without limiting the generality of
any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party shall duly execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
subrogation and subordination rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate
in the prosecution of such claims.

 



 

(c) Each party shall, and shall cause its respective affiliates to, take all
reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss indemnifiable hereunder upon and after
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Loss. No party shall be entitled to any payment, adjustment or
indemnification more than once with respect to the same matter.

 



 

SECTION 9.06. _Exclusivity_. Except as expressly provided in any Ancillary
Agreement or for Losses arising out of or resulting from fraud by a party with
respect to any of such partys representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ or _Article IV_, as applicable, from and after the Closing,
each partys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims in
respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of the Transferred Subsidiary, KI or the Transferred Share, shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ or
_Article X_ hereof and the remedies in _Section 11.15_ hereof, it being
understood that nothing in this sentence shall operate to interfere with or
impede the operation of the provisions of _Section 2.03_ hereof (including
_Section 2.03(b)(iii)_ hereof). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether based on warranty, in contract, or in tort
(including negligence or strict liability) or law or otherwise that such party
or any of its Indemnified Parties may have against the other party, any of
their respective affiliates or any Debt Financing Source or any other person,
except for Losses arising out of or resulting from fraud by a party with
respect to any of such partys representations and warranties contained in
Article III or Article IV, as applicable, or pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article IX_ or _Article X_ hereof and the
remedies in _Section 11.15_ hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, (a) no breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the
part of Purchaser, on the one hand, or any of the Seller Parties, on the other
hand, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (b) the Seller Parties hereby waive and agree not to assert, and
shall cause their affiliates to waive and not assert, any claims against the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI (or any successor thereto) with respect to any
liabilities or obligations of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI (or any
successor thereto) arising under any Continuing Commercial Arrangement (other
than (x) any payment obligations outstanding as of the Closing and reflected
in the Closing Working Capital and (y) any liabilities or obligations arising
with respect to the performance of such Continuing Commercial Arrangement
following the Closing). No past, present or future Representative,
incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of any of the Seller Parties or
any of their respective affiliates shall have any liability, whether based on
warranty, in contract or in tort (including negligence or strict liability) or
law or otherwise for any obligations or liabilities of any of the Seller
Parties or any of its respective affiliates arising under, in connection with
or related to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of the Acquisition, including any alleged non-disclosure or
misrepresentations made by any such persons.

 



 

SECTION 9.07. _Tax Treatment of Indemnification_. For all Tax purposes,
Purchaser and the Seller Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment under
this Agreement as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price unless a final
determination of a Taxing Authority (which shall include the execution of an
IRS Form 870-AD or successor form) provides otherwise.

 



 

SECTION 9.08. _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ or
_Section 7.03(a)_ hereof shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of
_Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ hereof. The Specified Representations and the
Purchaser Specified Representations shall remain in full force and effect
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; the
representations and warranties in respect of Taxes (including the
representations and warranties in _Section 3.14_) shall remain in full force
and effect until sixty days following the expiration of the relevant statute
of limitations;

 



      
 

 



 

the representations and warranties in _Section 3.18_ (Environmental Matters)
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, and all other representations and
warranties shall terminate at the close of business on the day that is 18
months following the Closing Date. The covenants or agreements contained in
_Section 5.01_ and _Section 5.05_ of this Agreement to be performed on or
prior to the Closing Date shall survive the Closing until the close of
business on the day that is 18 months following the Closing Date, all other
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed on or
prior to the Closing Date shall not survive the Closing Date, and all
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement which by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing until
the expiration of the term of the undertaking set forth in such agreements and
covenants. The indemnity contained in _Section 9.01(d)_ of this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until the close of business on the day that is 24
months following the Closing Date and the indemnities contained in _Section
9.01(f)_ and _Section 9.01(g)_ of this Agreement shall survive the Closing
until the close of business on the day that is 42 months following the Closing
Date. After the Closing, no party shall have any liability or obligation of
any nature with respect to any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
or indemnity after the termination thereof unless a notice of a breach thereof
giving rise to a right of indemnity or claim thereunder shall have been given
to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to the applicable
time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.08_, if
notice of any claim for indemnification shall have been given with specificity
and in writing to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought within
the applicable survival period, the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements that are the subject of such indemnification claim shall survive
with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is finally resolved;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any claim subject to the foregoing is
unresolved and continuing as of the date that is twelve months after the date
of the notice of such claim and no lawsuit with respect thereto shall have
been filed by the Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, such claim
shall not be entitled to any indemnification hereunder and shall be
extinguished.

TAX MATTERS

 



 

SECTION 10.01. _Tax Covenants_. (a) Transfer Taxes. Each of Purchaser and UCB
shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as
may be required in connection with Purchasers payment of Transfer Taxes. UCB
or Purchaser, as applicable, shall execute and deliver all instruments and
certificates necessary to enable the other to comply with any filing
requirements relating to any such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser shall pay all
Transfer Taxes.

 



 

(b) Purchaser agrees to retain all records relating to Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI for all taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statutes of limitation (including
any extensions thereof) for the taxable period or periods to which such
records relate. Purchaser and UCB agree to provide each other with such
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary (at the expense of the
requesting party),

 



      
 

 



 

including access to records and personnel, for the preparation of any Tax
Returns or claims for refund, or for the defense of any Tax claim or
assessment, whether in connection with an audit or otherwise. Any information
obtained under this _Section 10.01(b)_ shall be kept confidential, except as
may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting any audit, examination or other proceeding.

 



 

(c) [ _Intentionally omitted_ ]

 



 

(d) The Seller Parties and Purchaser agree to treat the acquisition of the
Transferred Subsidiary as a "qualified stock purchase" for federal income Tax
purposes as such term is defined in Section 338(d)(3) of the Code. UCB
Holdings, Inc. shall join, and UCB Holdings, Inc. shall cause to join any
other person so required to join, with Purchaser in making a timely and
effective election provided for by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 and any comparable election under state,
local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the purchase of the Transferred
Subsidiary (each, an " _Election_ " and collectively, the " _Elections_ ").
Purchaser and the Seller Parties shall cooperate with each other to take all
actions necessary and appropriate, including filing such additional forms,
returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required to effect
and preserve timely Elections in accordance with the provisions of Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (and any
comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law) or any successor
provisions. Specifically, UCB Holdings, Inc. and Purchaser shall, within 30
Business Days prior to the date such forms are required to be filed under
applicable Law, exchange completed and executed copies of the IRS Form 8023,
required schedules thereto, and any similar state, local or foreign forms. If
changes are required in any of these forms as a result of information that is
first available after the date on which any such form is completed and
executed pursuant to the preceding sentence, the parties will act in good
faith to agree on such changes. If the parties are unable to agree on such
changes within 10 days after the delivery of such information, such dispute
shall be resolved by the Independent Expert. The Seller Parties and Purchaser
shall report the acquisition by Purchaser of the Transferred Subsidiary
consistent with the treatment of such purchase as a "qualified stock purchase"
and consistent with the Election and shall take no position inconsistent
therewith in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any Taxing Authority or
otherwise.

 



 

(e) The parties agree that the Adjusted Purchase Price and the liabilities of
the Transferred Subsidiary and KI (to the extent properly taken into account
pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) will be allocated among the assets
of the Transferred Subsidiary and KI in a manner consistent with Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Purchaser
will complete a draft schedule (the " _Allocation Statement_ ") allocating the
Adjusted Purchase Price and the assumed liabilities to the assets of the
Transferred Subsidiary and KI and provide a copy to UCB no later than six
months after the Closing Date. The Allocation Statement shall be updated as
agreed by the parties including to take account of any contingent
consideration. UCB shall notify Purchaser within ten days after receipt
thereof if it disputes the amount allocated to any assets on the proposed
Allocation Statement. UCB and Purchaser shall attempt to resolve any
disagreement in good faith. If the parties are unable to

 



      
 

 



 

resolve such dispute within 30 days after UCB notifies the Purchaser of the
dispute, such dispute shall be resolved by the Independent Expert. The fees
and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by UCB, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. Purchaser and UCB shall file, and
cause their respective affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and statements,
forms and schedules in connection therewith in a manner consistent with the
Allocation Statement (as finally determined).

 



 

SECTION 10.02. _Tax Filings and Other Tax Matters_. (a) _Pre-Closing Tax
Period Tax Returns_. UCB (or its affiliates) shall prepare and timely file (or
cause to be prepared and timely filed) the following Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with most recent past practice and with existing procedures for
preparing such Tax Returns and pay Taxes shown as due thereon: (i) all Tax
Returns of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI due on or prior to the Closing
Date; (ii) all Income Tax Returns of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI due
after the Closing Date in the case of a combined, consolidated or unitary
Income Tax Return that includes UCB or an affiliate of UCB which is not being
transferred pursuant to this Agreement; and (iii) in the case of the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI, any other Income Tax Return for a taxable period
of such corporation ending on or before the Closing Date but filed thereafter;
_provided_ , that UCB may exclude the Transferred Subsidiary from certain
unitary Tax Returns that include affiliates of UCB not being transferred
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. (i) As to any Income Tax Return of the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI for a tax period that begins before and ends
after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), Purchaser shall cause the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI, as applicable, to prepare and timely file (or
cause to be prepared and timely filed) such Tax Return and pay all Taxes due
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that UCB shall reimburse
Purchaser for any amount owed by UCB with respect to such Tax Return in
accordance with _Section 10.03_ hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
as to any Tax Return for which UCB may be liable for an indemnity under
_Section 10.03_ hereof: (A) Purchaser shall deliver any such Tax Return to
UCB at least 20 days before it is due, (B) UCB shall have the right to examine
and provide written comments on any such Tax Return prior to the filing
thereof and the Purchaser shall make such revisions to such Tax Return as are
reasonably requested by UCB in writing, and (C) UCB shall provide to the
Purchaser such written comments or written revisions no later than 8 days
before the Tax Return is due.

 



 

(ii) UCB and Purchaser shall make (or cause any of their respective affiliates
to make) any election available under Law to treat the Closing Date as the end
of a relevant taxable period.

 



 

(c) _Amended Tax Returns_. Except as required by Law, after the Closing Date,
none of Purchaser, the Transferred Subsidiary, KI or any affiliate of
Purchaser shall, without the prior written consent of UCB, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, file any amended Tax Return with
respect to a Straddle Period or a Pre-Closing Tax Period if UCB or any of its
affiliates could reasonably be expected to be liable for additional Taxes on
such Tax Return under _Section 10.03_ hereof. Except as required by Law,
after the Closing Date, none of UCB or its affiliates shall, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, file any amended Tax Return with
respect to the Pre-Closing Period to the extent such amendment could
reasonably be expected to have a material cost to the Purchaser, the
Transferred Subsidiary or KI.

 



 

(d) [ _Intentionally omitted_.]

 



 

(e) _Refunds and Credits_. Any refund or credit of Taxes (including any
interest actually received thereon from a relevant Taxing Authority less any
cost or Taxes with respect thereto incurred by Purchaser or its affiliates)
relating to the Transferred Subsidiary or KI for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(or other Taxes which UCB has paid under _Section 10.03_ or _Section 9.01_
hereof) shall be for the account of UCB except to the extent such refund or
credit or results from the carryback of an item from a Post-Closing Tax Period
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any other refund or credit (including any
interest actually received thereon from a relevant Taxing Authority) of Taxes
relating to the Transferred Subsidiary or KI shall be for the account of
Purchaser. Purchaser shall, if UCB so requests and at UCBs expense, file for
and obtain or cause the Transferred Subsidiary or KI to file for and obtain
any refunds or credits to which UCB is entitled under this _Section
10.02(e)_. Purchaser, the Transferred Subsidiary and KI shall cooperate in
good faith with UCB with respect to the prosecution of any such refund claim.
If UMI pays (or causes the Transferred Subsidiary, KI or any member of the UCB
Group to pay prior to Closing) estimated Income Taxes for any Straddle Period
in excess of the amount ultimately determined to be due for the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (taking into account solely
items attributable to such portion), and Purchaser obtains the benefit of such
excess payment, Purchaser shall promptly refund such excess to UMI, provided
that no such refund to UMI shall be required in respect of any amount thereof
reflected in the Closing Working Capital as finally determined.

 



 

(f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. UCB shall cause any Tax sharing agreement to
which the Transferred Subsidiary or KI is a party to be terminated on or prior
to the Closing Date such that no party shall have any rights or obligations
under any such Tax sharing agreement after the Closing Date. UCB shall cause
any and all existing powers of attorney with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns
to which the Transferred Subsidiary or KI is a party to be terminated as of
the Closing.

 



 

(g) _Consolidated Returns_. The consolidated federal Income Tax Return of the
UCB Group for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date shall be filed
in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (determined
using the closing of the books method), with no election under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D).

 



 

SECTION 10.03. _Tax Indemnification_. (a) From and after the Closing, UCB
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees from and against
(i) all liability for Taxes of or in respect of the Transferred Subsidiary or
KI for the Pre-Closing Tax Period, together with any interest, penalty or
additions to Tax accruing after the Closing Date on such Taxes, (ii) all
liability of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI for Taxes arising as a result of

 



      
 

 



 

Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law, (iii) all liability of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI for Taxes
that are imposed by reason of the Transferred Subsidiary or KI having
liability for Taxes of another person arising under principles of transferee
or successor liability or by contract as a result of activities or
transactions taking place prior to the Closing, (iv) all liability for Taxes
of the Purchaser, the Transferred Subsidiary, KI, any of their affiliates or
their respective subsidiaries (or any successors thereto) for any inaccuracy
in or breach of any Tax representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by the Seller Parties in this Agreement, (v) all liability for Taxes of or in
respect of the Transferred Subsidiary as a result of UCBs excluding the
Transferred Subsidiary from any unitary Tax Returns pursuant to the proviso in
Section 10.02(a) (the " _Section 10.02(a) Proviso_"), and (vi) all liability
for reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in clause (i)
through (v) above.

 



 

(b) (i) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against all liability for Taxes of
the Transferred Subsidiary or KI for any Post-Closing Tax Period (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) to the extent UCB is not required to pay
indemnification therefor under _Section 10.03(a)_ and (ii) Purchaser shall
pay to UCB Holdings, Inc., upon UCB Holdings, Inc.s making a claim therefor
as provided herein, 50% of the excess, if any, of the income taxes for which
UCB Holdings, Inc., UMI or the Transferred Subsidiary are liable as a result
of any valid Elections made with respect to the sale of the Transferred Share
contemplated by this Agreement over the income taxes for which UCB Holdings,
Inc., UMI or the Transferred Subsidiary would have been liable with respect to
the sale of the Transferred Share contemplated by this Agreement had no such
Elections been made, _provided_ that Purchaser shall not be required to pay
any amount in respect of any increase in the liability for Taxes as a result
of UCBs excluding the Transferred Subsidiary from any unitary Tax Returns
pursuant to the Section 10.02(a) Proviso, and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the maximum amount for which Purchaser shall be liable under this _Section
10.03(b)(ii)_ shall not exceed $35 million in the aggregate. In connection
with any claim by UCB Holdings, Inc. under _Section 10.03(b)(ii)_, UCB
Holdings, Inc. shall provide Purchaser with reasonably detailed documentary
evidence and computations supporting any such claim. The parties shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute concerning any such claim, and
Purchaser shall make the payment required under _Section 10.03(b)(ii)_
promptly following the furnishing of such supporting information or promptly
following resolution of any such dispute, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 10.03_, any liability for Taxes
attributable to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning on the day
after the Closing Date (a) in the case of real and personal property Taxes, by
apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and (b) in the case of all other
Taxes, on the basis of a closing of the books as of the close of business on
the Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a per diem basis.
For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this _Section 10.03_, in the case
of any Income Taxes attributable to the ownership of an entity that is taxed
as a partnership or of any other entity that is treated as a "flow-through"
entity for Tax purposes, the portion of such Income Taxes that relates to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to be the amount that would be payable if the relevant Tax period of
such "flow-through" entity ended on the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement and for the
avoidance of doubt, the limitations in _Section 9.04_ shall not apply to this
_Section 10.03_.

 



 

SECTION 10.04. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_. (a) If
one party is responsible for the payment of Taxes pursuant to _Sections 9.01_
, _9.02_ or _10.03_ hereof (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), and the other
party to this Agreement (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") receives a notice of
deficiency, proposed adjustment, adjustment, assessment, audit, examination,
suit, dispute or other claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ") with respect (in whole or in
part) to such Taxes, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Tax
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. No failure or delay on the
part of the Tax Indemnified Party to give notice to the Tax Indemnifying Party
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Tax
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that the
Tax Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby.

 



 

(b) The Tax Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the applicable audit
or examination and the defense of a Tax Claim involving any Taxes for which it
has an obligation to indemnify the Tax Indemnified Party pursuant to _Sections
9.01_ , _9.02_ or _10.03_ hereof, and the Tax Indemnified Party and its
affiliates agree to cooperate reasonably with the Tax Indemnifying Party in
pursuing such contest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (i) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified
Party informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax
Claim, (ii) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall give to the Tax Indemnified Party
a copy of any Tax adjustments proposed in writing with respect to such Tax
Claim, and (iii) the Tax Indemnified Party, at its own cost and expense and
with its own counsel, shall have the right to participate in (but not control)
the applicable audit or examination and defense of such Tax Claim.

 



 

(c) In no case shall any Tax Indemnified Party settle or otherwise compromise
(or extend the statute of limitations for) any Tax Claim without the other Tax
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent.

 



 

SECTION 10.05. _Overlap_. To the extent of any inconsistency between this
_Article X_ and _Article IX_, this _Article X_ shall control as to Tax
matters.

any of the Seller Parties), as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ that
Purchaser may, without consent, pledge any of its rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement as security to any of its Debt Financing
Sources or any agent or collateral trustee for such Debt Financing Sources;
_provided_ , _further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of

Taxes).

 



       
 

 



 

SECTION 11.06. _Limitation on Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement (including in _Article IX_ or _Article
X_), in no event shall any party be liable for special, exemplary or punitive
damages of any other party or the Transferred Subsidiary or KI, whether or not
caused by or resulting from the actions of such party or the breach of its
covenants, agreements, representations or warranties hereunder and whether or
not based on or in warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict
liability) or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 11.06_ shall preclude any recovery by an Indemnified Party against
an Indemnifying Party for a Third Party Claim.

 



 

SECTION 11.07. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts
hereof signed by each of the other parties hereto. If any signature is
delivered by facsimile transmission or by PDF, such signature shall create a
valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf the
signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or
PDF signature were an original thereof.

 



 

SECTION 11.08. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, and the Exhibits and Seller
Disclosure Schedule annexed hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire understanding between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all other
understandings and negotiations with respect thereto. The parties agree to
define their rights, liabilities and obligations with respect to such
understanding and the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract
pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the
parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to
any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement (including the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits), on the one hand, and the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (including the schedules
and exhibits thereto), on the other hand, the provisions of this Agreement
shall control.

 



 

SECTION 11.09. _Severability_. In the event that any provision contained in
this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective as to
such jurisdiction to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions
hereof or affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

SECTION 11.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the Commitment Letter, the Fee
Letter, the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof, and any
disputes, claims or causes of action arising under or related hereto or
thereto (whether at law or in equity, or for breach of contract, tortious
conduct or otherwise) shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
principles or rules on conflicts of law to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 11.11. _Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably agrees that any
Proceeding against them arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter, or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or disputes relating hereto or thereto (whether for breach
of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be brought exclusively in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the
borough of Manhattan, or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the state
courts of New York located in New York County in the borough of Manhattan, and
hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the aforesaid courts _in personam_ with respect to any such Proceeding and
waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any objection that it may now or
hereafter have that any such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

 



 

SECTION 11.12. _Service of Process_. Each of the parties consents to service
of any process, summons, notice or document which may be served in any
Proceeding in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or the state courts of New York located in New York County, which
service may be made by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, or as
otherwise provided in _Section 11.04_ hereof, to such partys respective
address set forth in _Section 11.04_ hereof.

 



 

SECTION 11.13. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the Fee Letter or
any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions or the financings contemplated
hereby or thereby or disputes relating hereto or thereto. Each party (a)
certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in
this _Section 11.13_.

 



 

SECTION 11.14. _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified, superseded or canceled and any of the terms, covenants,
representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties or, in the case of a
waiver, by or on behalf of the party waiving compliance. No course of dealing
between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any provision of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section
11.14_, none of _Section 9.06_, _Section 11.01_, _Section 11.02_, _Section
11.10_, _Section 11.11_, _Section 11.13_, _Section 11.18_ or this sentence
may be modified or amended in a manner that is adverse in any respect to any
Debt Financing Source without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing
Sources party to the Commitment Letter.

 



 

SECTION 11.15. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that
(a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
and (b) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Seller Parties nor Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The
parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section
11.15_ shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

SECTION 11.16. _Joint Drafting_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.17. _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to
any other party under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, which
obligation is performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an affiliate of
such party, shall be deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by
such party.

 



 

SECTION 11.18. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of the Seller Parties agrees, for itself and on behalf of
their respective affiliates and Seller Indemnitees, that none of the Debt
Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Seller Parties
or their respective affiliates or Seller Indemnitees relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

EXHIBIT A

 



 

Form of Transitional Services Agreement

 



 

Exhibit A to the Stock Purchase Agreement

 



 

TRANSITIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT dated as of [*], 2015 (this " _Agreement_ "),
between UCB S.A., a limited liability company organized under the laws of
Belgium (" _UCB_ "), and Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals Inc., an Indiana
corporation (" _KU_ ").

 



 

INTRODUCTION

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of September 2,
2015 (as it may be amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the " _Stock Purchase Agreement_ "), among UCB,
UCB Manufacturing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _UMI_ " and, together with
UCB, the " _Seller Parties_ "), and Lannett Company, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), Purchaser agreed to purchase from the Seller
Parties, and the Seller Parties agreed to sell to Purchaser, the Transferred
Share as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, (i) KU desires to
purchase from UCB, and UCB is willing to provide, or to cause its affiliates
to provide, to KU transitional services for the conduct of KU, and (ii) UCB
desires to purchase from KU, and KU is willing to provide, or to cause its
affiliates to provide, to UCB transitional services for the conduct of UCB, on
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

SECTION 1. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Stock Purchase
Agreement.

 



 

(a) " _Service Provider_ " shall refer to UCB unless otherwise indicated with
respect to a transitional service on Annex A hereto (the " _Annex_ ").

 



 

(b) " _Service Recipient_ " shall refer to KU or Purchaser unless otherwise
indicated with respect to a transitional service on the Annex.

 



 

(c) " _Business_ " shall refer to (i) with respect to KU, the business of KU
and KI (taken as a whole), and (ii) with respect to UCB, the business of UCB.

 



 

SECTION 2. _Transition Services_. (a) During the Term (as defined below),
Service Provider shall provide, or shall cause one or more of its affiliates
or Third Party Providers to provide, to Service Recipient and its controlled
affiliates the services set forth on the Annex (the " _Services_ "), in the
manner and at a level of service generally consistent with that provided by
Service Provider or its affiliates in connection with the applicable Business
immediately preceding the date hereof, and Service Recipient shall use the
Services for substantially the same purposes and in substantially the same
manner as the Services were used in connection with the applicable Business
immediately preceding the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement taking into
account transition related activities between the date of the Stock Purchase
Agreement and the date hereof in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Service Provider shall be required to provide, or cause one or more of its
affiliates to provide, the Services only to Service

      
 

 



 

Recipient and its controlled affiliates and only in connection with the
applicable Business. Service Recipient shall not, and shall not permit its
controlled affiliates or any Third Party Provider, to, resell, subcontract,
license, sublicense or otherwise transfer any of the Services being provided
to Service Recipient to any person whatsoever or permit the use of the
Services by any person other than Service Recipient and its affiliates in
connection with the applicable Business in the ordinary course of business or
otherwise in connection with the transition from the performance of the
Services by Service Provider to the performance of the Services by Service
Recipient.

 



 

(b) Service Recipient acknowledges that Service Provider is not in the
business of providing services to third parties and is entering into this
Agreement only in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement. Service
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause
its affiliates and Third Party Providers to provide, the Services pursuant to
this Agreement, with substantially the same degree of skill, quality and care
utilized by Service Provider (or its affiliates) in performing such Services
for itself, in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Service Provider shall have no obligation to
provide the Services if doing so significantly interferes with Service
Providers own business activities; _provided_ , _further_ , that in such
case, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to identify a
Third Party Provider that is reasonably acceptable to Service Recipient at
Service Providers expense to provide such Services in lieu of Service
Provider with no material interruption in the provision of Services (the "
_Services Standard_ "). Under no circumstances shall Service Provider, its
affiliates or its or their employees or agents (including subcontractors) be
held accountable to a greater standard of care or skill than the Services
Standard. If the quality or performance of any Service provided by Service
Provider or its affiliate or Third Party Provider hereunder falls materially
below the Services Standard required by this Section 2(b) (except to the
extent excused pursuant to Section 27 or to the extent such decline in quality
or performance is the direct result of any breach of this Agreement by Service
Recipient), Service Recipient may notify Service Provider of such shortfall,
and Service Provider shall cure, or cause its applicable affiliate or Third
Party Provider to cure, such shortfall within ten Business Days after
receiving such notice. If Service Provider does not cure such shortfall within
ten Business Days after receiving such notice, Service Recipient may, in
addition to any other rights Service Recipient may have under this Agreement
or under applicable Law, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
(i) withhold payment of any Fees due for the applicable Services until such
time as Service Recipient reasonably determines that such shortfall has been
cured ( _provided_ that Service Recipient may apply any such withheld Fees to
pay any portion of the costs for which Service Provider is responsible in
accordance with clause (ii)) and/or (ii) obtain a replacement service from a
third party at no greater cost than is provided for such Service in the Annex
plus ten percent (10%), and Service Provider shall be responsible for the cost
of any such replacement service, less the amount Service Recipient is required
to pay pursuant to this Agreement for the Service that was replaced. NEITHER
SERVICE PROVIDER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Service Recipient acknowledges that Service Provider and its affiliates
may be providing similar services, and/or services that involve the same
resources as those used to provide the Services, to its internal
organizations, affiliates and third parties (" _Internal Services_ "). To the
extent Service Provider modifies its Internal Services in connection with
changes to its internal organization in the ordinary course of business,
Service Provider may request to accordingly modify the related Services, which
proposed modification Service Recipient will consider in good faith. Any
changes to the Services shall require written consent of both Service Provider
and Service Recipient.

 



 

(d) In providing, or otherwise making available, the Services to Service
Recipient, Service Provider may use its own personnel or the personnel of any
of its affiliates and/or employ the services of contractors, subcontractors,
vendors or other third-party providers used by Service Provider or its
affiliates to provide any similar Internal Services (each, a " _Third-Party
Provider_ "); _provided_ that (1) Service Provider shall remain obligated with
respect to such Services provided by any Third-Party Provider (including the
fulfillment of the Services Standard), except to the extent that Service
Recipient and any such Third-Party Provider agree that such Third-Party
Provider shall be directly responsible to Service Recipient for the
performance or non-performance of any such Services, and (2) the use of any
Third-Party Provider shall not increase any fees or other amounts (including
Sales Taxes) payable by Service Recipient hereunder. Service Provider and its
affiliates, in connection with providing the Services, shall not be obligated
to pay any amounts to Service Recipient or any of its controlled affiliates or
any of their respective employees (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not
include the Personnel) in respect of payroll, benefits or similar obligations.
In addition, to the extent Service Provider or its affiliates incur any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including any license fees) that
are incurred in accordance with and necessary and incidental to providing any
Service hereunder that are not reflected in the Fees payable with respect to
such Service, such out-of-pocket costs and expenses shall be borne by Service
Recipient, and shall be refunded to Service Provider by Service Recipient upon
Service Providers invoice presented therefor, provided that out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any Service exceeding,
individually or in the aggregate, 10% of the Fees payable with respect to such
Service shall not be borne or paid by Service Recipient unless Service
Recipient has given its prior written consent thereto.

 



 

(e) During the Term, Service Provider and each of its affiliates providing
Services hereunder shall cause certain of its employees (the " _Personnel_ ")
to provide the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and shall provide Service Recipient with access to the Personnel as
may reasonably be necessary to furnish the Services to Service Recipient as
contemplated herein. Service Provider and its affiliates providing Services
hereunder shall be responsible for complying with all applicable labor Laws
and regulations or other related obligations with respect to its Personnel
providing any Services hereunder, including all payroll, benefits, tax and
other obligations related to the employment of the Personnel.

 



 

(f) With respect to the Services, Service Provider shall have the exclusive
right to select, employ, pay, supervise, administer, direct and discharge any
of the employees who will

 



      
 

 



 

perform the Services. Service Provider shall be responsible for paying such
employees compensation and providing to such employees any benefits.

 



 

(g) Service Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the Services are intended
only to be transitional in nature, and shall be furnished by Service Provider
only during the Term and solely for the purpose of accommodating Service
Recipient in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Stock
Purchase Agreement. Service Recipient acknowledges that the Services are being
furnished in support of Service Recipients personnel and under no
circumstances shall Service Provider be required to fulfill or serve as a
substitute for any personnel role of Service Recipient.

 



 

(h) Service Provider acknowledges that the Services include Service Providers
cooperation with and assistance to Service Recipient in connection with the
transition from the performance of the Services hereunder to the performance
of such services by Service Recipient and its affiliates or third parties
designated by Service Recipient and that the Services shall include the
provision of services requested by Service Recipient or its affiliates in
connection with knowledge transfer, the transition of records, segregation and
migration of historical data, migration-specific enhancements and cooperation
with and assistance to third party consultants engaged by Service Recipient or
its affiliates in connection with the foregoing, in each case and to the
extent reasonably agreed by the parties.

 



 

SECTION 3. _Access; Coordination; Consents_. (a) Upon prior written notice
from Service Provider, Service Recipient shall make available on a timely
basis to Service Provider all information and materials reasonably requested
by Service Provider or its affiliates to enable it to provide the Services
hereunder. Service Recipient shall give Service Provider and its affiliates
and Third Party Providers reasonable access, on prior written notice and
during regular business hours and at such other times as are reasonably
required, to Service Recipients premises for the purpose of providing the
Services hereunder. While in or on Service Recipients premises, Service
Provider shall, and shall cause its affiliates and Third Party Providers to
comply with Service Recipients security guidelines and other procedures for
access to and use of such premises that are made available to Service Provider
from time to time.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Closing Date, Service Recipient and Service Provider
shall each designate an individual with authority, and an alternate to act in
the absence of such individual, to act as such partys coordinator (a partys
" _Coordinator_ "). The Coordinators appointed for each of the parties will be
responsible for serving as a liaison between Service Provider and Service
Recipient with respect to the coordination and performance of all Services.

 



 

(c) To the extent the consent of any subcontractor or other third party is
needed in order for Service Provider to use such subcontractor or third party
to provide the Services (including any third party consents required to use
third party software, technology or other intellectual property), Service
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents and
Service Recipient shall cooperate with Service Provider in acquiring any such
consents. If a subcontractor or other third party conditions its consent on
imposing requirements or restrictions on Service Recipient, Service Provider
and Service Recipient shall discuss such requirements or restrictions in good
faith and to the extent Service Recipient agrees thereto,

 



      
 

 



 

Service Recipient shall (i) comply with any requirements imposed on Service
Recipient in connection with securing such consent and (ii) comply with any
restrictions imposed on the use of such resources. Service Provider and
Service Recipient shall each be responsible for 50% of any reasonable fees
payable to such subcontractor or other third party to the extent necessary to
secure the consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the
contrary, if Service Provider is unable to secure such consents, Service
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange an alternative
method of delivering such Services to Service Recipient.

 



 

(d) If Service Provider or its affiliates or any Third Party Provider has
access (either on-site or remotely) to the information technology systems
owned by Service Recipient or its affiliates in relation to the Services or
Migration Services, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to limit, or cause to be limited, such access solely to the use of such
systems for purposes of the Services or Migration Services and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not access or attempt to access such
systems or services other than to the extent required for the Services or
Migration Services. Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to limit such access to those of its and its affiliates or Third Party
Providers employees with a _bona fide_ need to have such access in order to
perform the Services or Migration Services, and shall comply in all material
respects with Service Recipients security rules and procedures for
restricting access to its or its affiliates information technology systems
(provided that Service Recipient shall have made available or communicated
such rules and procedures to Service Provider). All user identification
numbers and passwords disclosed to Service Provider or its affiliates or Third
Party Providers and any information obtained by Service Provider or its
affiliates or Third Party Providers as a result of its or their access to and
use of Service Recipients or its affiliates information technology systems
shall be deemed to be, and treated as, Confidential Information hereunder.
Service Provider shall, and shall cause its affiliates and Third Party
Providers to, cooperate with Service Recipient in the investigation of any
apparent unauthorized access to Service Recipients or its affiliates
information technology systems.

 



 

SECTION 4. _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) To the extent permissible under the applicable agreement and to the extent
that Service Provider has the right to do so (including in each case if
Service Provider has received a consent or waiver with respect thereto),
Service Provider (on behalf of itself and its affiliates) hereby grants to
Service Recipient and its affiliates a limited, nonexclusive, non-
sublicenseable (except to third parties solely to the extent required for the
receipt of any Service), non-assignable (except as expressly provided for in
Section 13 hereof), worldwide, royalty-free license, during the Term of the
applicable Service, to use any software, technology and other intellectual
property rights used in connection with the receipt or use of such Service and
owned or licensed by Service Provider (including any software or technology
listed in the Annex), solely to the extent necessary for Service Recipient and
its affiliates to receive and use such Service as provided for and in
accordance with this Agreement, subject to any applicable restrictions,
limitations and other provisions set forth or referenced in the Annex or
otherwise applicable to the access or use of any third party software or
licenses, including any applicable license agreements.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 4(a), the parties acknowledge and
agree that KU may use and has a license to use during and after the term of
this Agreement UCBs standard operating procedures to develop KUs standalone
standard operating procedures. Further, for the avoidance of doubt, KUs
ownership rights in its standard operating procedures shall be subject to
UCBs right, title and interest in any standard operating procedures owned by
UCB or its affiliates.

 



 

(c) Service Recipient (on behalf of itself and its affiliates) hereby grants
to Service Provider and its affiliates a limited, nonexclusive, non-
sublicenseable (except to Third Party Providers solely to the extent required
for the receipt of any Service), non-assignable (except as expressly provided
for in Section 13 hereof), worldwide, royalty-free license, during the Term of
the applicable Service, to use any intellectual property used in connection
with the provision of such Service and owned by Service Recipient, solely to
the extent necessary for Service Provider and its affiliates to provide such
Service and in accordance with this Agreement, subject to any applicable
restrictions, limitations and other provisions set forth or referenced in the
Annex. Service Provider shall, and shall cause its affiliates and Third Party
Providers to, use any trademarks included in such licensed intellectual
property in accordance with such quality standards as may be set by Service
Recipient and communicated to Service Provider from time to time.

 



 

(d) OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 4 HEREOF OR THE STOCK
PURCHASE AGREEMENT, NO OTHER LICENSES TO PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS,
TRADEMARKS, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE GRANTED BY SERVICE PROVIDER TO
SERVICE RECIPIENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BY IMPLICATION, ESTOPPEL, EXHAUSTION OR
ANY OTHER THEORY, AND SERVICE PROVIDER RESERVES ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY
GRANTED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

 



 

SECTION 5. _Payment_. (a) For the Services rendered under this Agreement,
Service Recipient will pay Service Providers fees (the " _Fees_ ") as set
forth in the Annex. Except as otherwise provided in the Annex, for any Service
priced on a monthly or other periodic basis, the Fee set forth on the Annex
will be equitably prorated if the date hereof or the date on which such
Service is commenced or terminated is not the first calendar day or the last
calendar day, respectively, of a calendar month or other relevant period.

 



 

(b) Service Provider agrees to submit invoices to Service Recipient for Fees
payable in respect of (i) any Services for which specific invoicing procedures
are specified in the Annex, in accordance with such specific invoicing
procedures and (ii) all other Services provided by or on behalf of such
Service Provider during any calendar month within 30 days after the end of
such calendar month, commencing with an invoice issued on or before the 30th
day after the end of the first calendar month ending after the Closing Date.
Each such invoice shall be in a format and contain a level of detail
reasonably sufficient under the circumstances to identify the Services
provided during the applicable period and such Service Providers calculation
of the amounts payable in respect thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Service Recipient agrees to pay each invoice delivered pursuant to Section
5(b) hereof on or before the date that is 30 days after the date of such
invoice ( _provided_ , _however_ , if the 30th calendar day is not a Business
Day, the applicable Payment Date shall be the immediately following Business
Day) (each, a " _Payment Date_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds payable to the order of Service Provider pursuant to wire transfer
instructions specified on the applicable invoice. Any Fees or other sums owing
hereunder not paid within 15 Business Days of a Payment Date shall be subject
to late charges for each day such Fees or other sums are overdue, calculated
at a rate of 5% per annum from the Payment Date to the date of payment.

 



 

(d) Service Provider shall maintain true and correct records of all receipts,
invoices, reports, time entries and other documents relating to the Services
rendered hereunder, consistent with reasonable business practices and
sufficient to provide reasonable records for review by Service Recipient.
Service Provider shall retain such records for a period of not less than two
years from the close of each fiscal year of Service Recipient during which
such Services were provided; _provided_ , that Service Provider may (in its
sole discretion) transfer such records to Service Recipient. Service Recipient
shall have the right to review such records not more than once in any twelve-
month period and, in connection therewith, Service Provider shall give Service
Recipient and its affiliates reasonable access, on prior written notice and
during regular business hours and at such other times as are reasonably
required, to such records for the purpose thereof. Service Recipient will bear
the cost of such review. If Service Recipient reasonably believes that such
review reveals an overbilling by Service Provider and overpayment by Service
Recipient, Service Provider shall, within ten days of the completion of the
procedures set out in Section 10, reimburse Service Recipient for such
overpaid amount, if any, plus interest calculated at a rate of 5% per annum
from the date on which such amount was overpaid by Service Recipient through
the date of reimbursement.

 



 

SECTION 6. _Taxes_. (a) All sales tax, value added tax, goods and services
tax or similar tax (" _Sales Taxes_ ") (but excluding any Taxes based on the
net income of Service Provider, which shall be paid by Service Provider)
required by Law to be paid by Service Recipient in respect of the provision of
the Services hereunder will be separately stated on the relevant invoice and
shall be paid by Service Recipient in accordance with Section 5\. Service
Provider shall be responsible for paying any such Sales Taxes to the
appropriate taxing authority and filing any required reports or forms.

 



 

(b) Service Provider shall, upon request by Service Recipient, provide to
Service Recipient a receipt or other proof of payment of Sales Taxes to the
relevant taxing authority and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist Service Recipient in obtaining any available relief from, or credit or
refund of, such Sales Taxes.

 



 

SECTION 7. _Term of Agreement_. The term (" _Term_ ") of this Agreement shall
commence on the Closing Date and shall continue for a period ending on the
earliest of (i) as to any particular Service, the time period set forth for
such Service in the Annex (as such time period may be extended from time to
time as provided in the Annex, if applicable), and (ii) the date on which all
Services either have been terminated or are no longer being provided pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Service
Recipient (i) may terminate any

 



      
 

 



 

individual Service prior to the expiration of the time period for such Service
set forth in the Annex pursuant to Section 8(a) and (ii) will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cease using all Services under this
Agreement as soon as reasonably possible following the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 8. _Partial Termination; Termination_. (a) Any or all of the
Services provided by Service Provider or its affiliates under this Agreement
are terminable by Service Recipient on 30 days prior written notice to
Service Provider. Once any of the Services have been so terminated, Service
Recipient shall not be entitled to have such Services resumed.

 



 

(b) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated
term, upon written notice by Service Provider, if Service Recipient fails to
pay any undisputed Fees within ten days following a Payment Date and does not
cure such failure within the sixty days following such ten-day period.

 



 

(c) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated
term, upon written notice by Service Provider, on the one hand, or Service
Recipient, on the other hand, if the other party files, or has filed against
it, a petition for voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or pursuant to any
other insolvency law or makes or seeks to make a general assignment for the
benefit of its creditors or applies for or consents to the appointment of a
trustee, receiver or custodian for it or a substantial part of its property,
in which case this Agreement shall automatically terminate without any prior
notice or the passage of any period or the taking of any other action.

 



 

(d) Upon the termination of any Service or of this Agreement, Service
Recipient shall promptly pay to Service Provider all Fees accrued through the
effective date of such termination for such Services. Upon termination of any
or all Services pursuant to this Agreement, or upon the termination of this
Agreement in its entirety, Service Recipient will have no obligation to pay
any future Fees or other sums owing hereunder relating to such Services (other
than for or in respect of Services already provided in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and received by Service Recipient prior to such
termination).

 



 

SECTION 9. _Other Services_. In the event that Service Recipient requests
that, in addition to the Services, certain other services be made available by
Service Provider (the " _Other Services_ "), Service Provider shall have no
obligation to provide any Other Services. If, in its sole discretion, Service
Provider agrees to provide any Other Services, Service Provider and Service
Recipient shall negotiate in good faith the terms of providing such Other
Services and payment therefor. The provision, if any, of any Other Services
shall be on the terms and conditions agreed upon between Service Provider and
Service Recipient and set forth on a schedule to be attached hereto or as an
amendment to this Agreement. Any such Other Services mutually agreed to by the
parties hereto set forth on a schedule or included in an amendment to this
Agreement shall constitute "Services" hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 10. _Dispute Resolution_. If there is a dispute between the parties
hereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any schedule, either
party may, at any time, give notice to the other party requesting to discuss
actions that might be taken to resolve such dispute

 



      
 

 



 

and the parties hereto shall, promptly upon receipt of such notice, negotiate
in good faith with respect to the disputed issue and use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall obligate or require (or be construed
to obligate or require) either party to agree upon any such actions. If the
parties hereto shall have failed to reach a resolution of the dispute within
30 days after notice of such dispute has been given, either Service Provider
or Service Recipient, as the case may be, may, at any time within 15 days
after the expiration of such 30-day period, give written notice to the other
party requesting that the respective senior officers of Service Provider and
Service Recipient or their respective designees discuss such actions, and, as
promptly as practicable after such notice has been given, each of Service
Provider and Service Recipient shall cause such senior officers to negotiate
in good faith with respect to such actions and use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such dispute within 10 days of the matter being submitted
to them; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall obligate or require (or be construed to obligate or require) any of such
senior officers to agree upon any such actions. For the avoidance of doubt,
each party shall continue to perform its obligations under this Agreement
during any period of time when the dispute resolution procedures outlined
above are being followed.

 



 

SECTION 11. _Limitations on Losses_. (a) In no event shall Service Provider or
any of its affiliates be liable, whether in warranty, contract, tort
(including any form of negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or strict
liability) or otherwise, for any special, indirect, incidental, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages or any damages calculated by reference to a
multiplier of revenue, profits, EBITDA or similar methodology whatsoever of
Service Recipient, any of its affiliates or Representatives, which in any way
arise out of, relate to, or are a consequence of, Service Providers or any of
its affiliates performance or nonperformance hereunder, or the provision of
or failure to provide any of the Services hereunder, including loss of
profits, revenues, business interruptions or business opportunities and claims
of customers or employees of Purchaser, KU or Kudco Ireland Limited, a limited
liability company organized under the laws of Ireland; _provided_ that the
limitation on liability contained in this Section 11(a) shall not apply to any
indirect or consequential damages which may in any way arise out of, relate
to, or are a consequence of any intentional breach by Service Provider of this
Agreement, including with respect to the provision of or the failure to
provide any Service hereunder.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Service
Provider, its affiliates or any of their current or former respective
Representatives, stockholders, members, partners, incorporators, attorneys-in-
fact, subcontractors or contractors shall be liable for Losses incurred by
Service Recipient, any of its affiliates or Representatives to the extent such
recklessness, willful misconduct or fraud of, Service Recipient.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the liability
of Service Provider with respect to this Agreement or anything done in
connection herewith, including the performance or breach hereof, or from the
sale, delivery, provision or use of any of the Services provided under or
pursuant to this Agreement, whether in warranty, contract, tort (including any
form of negligence, recklessness, willful misconduct or strict liability) or
otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (i) the Fees previously paid and
(ii) the aggregate amount of Fees paid and payable during the first six months
of the Term to Service Provider by Service Recipient.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to exclude or limit Service Providers liability for
Losses incurred by Service Provider or any Service Recipient Indemnitee to the
extent such Losses (i) arise out of or result from Service Providers or any
of its affiliates or Third Party Providers recklessness, willful misconduct
or fraud or (ii) are recovered by a third party against Service Recipient or
any Service Recipient Indemnitee in any third party claim subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.

 



 

SECTION 12. _Indemnification_. (a) Service Recipient agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless Service Provider and each of its affiliates and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents and
representatives (the " _Service Provider Indemnitees_ "), and at the option of
the Service Provider Indemnitees defend the Service Provider Indemnitees, from
and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, obligations or
expenses, including reasonable third-party legal fees and expenses
(collectively, " _Losses_ "), to the extent arising out of or resulting from
Service Recipients or any of its affiliates (i) breach of this Agreement or
(ii) recklessness, willful misconduct or fraud.

 



 

(b) Service Provider, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns,
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Service Recipient and each of its
affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (the " _Service Recipient
Indemnitees_ "), and at the option of the Service Recipient Indemnitees defend
the Service Recipient Indemnitees, from and against any and all Losses, to the
extent arising out of or resulting from Service Providers or any of its
affiliates or Third Party Providers (i) breach of this Agreement or (ii)
recklessness, willful misconduct or fraud.

 



 

SECTION 13. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and
obligations of the parties hereunder may be assigned by Service Recipient, on
the one hand, or Service Provider, on the other hand, without the prior
written consent of Service Provider (in the case of Service Recipient) or
Service Recipient (in the case of Service Provider), as applicable; provided
that Service Recipient may assign this agreement to any of its controlled
affiliates upon written notice to and without prior written consent of Service
Provider. Subject to the first sentence of this Section 13, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment or
transfer in violation of this Section 13 shall be null and void.

 



 

SECTION 14. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 12,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any person, other than the
parties hereto and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 15. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given (a) five Business Days following sending by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid, (b) when delivered, if delivered personally to the
intended recipient and (c) one Business Day following sending by overnight
delivery via a national courier service and, in each case, addressed to a

 



      
 

 



 

party to the address for such party as set forth in Section 11.04 of the Stock
Purchase Agreement (or such other address for a party as set forth in Section
11.04 of the Stock Purchase Agreement as shall be specified in a notice given
in accordance with Section 11.04 of the Stock Purchase Agreement).

 



 

SECTION 16. _Interpretation_. References to defined terms in the singular
shall include the plural and references to defined terms in the plural shall
include the singular. "Extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree
to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean
simply "if". The descriptive headings of the several Sections of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this
Agreement and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. All references herein to "Sections" or "Schedules" shall be
deemed to be references to Sections hereof or Schedules hereto unless
otherwise indicated. The terms "hereof", "herein", "hereby" and derivative or
similar words refer to this entire Agreement. References to "party" or
"parties" means the parties to this Agreement, unless otherwise provided.

 



 

SECTION 17. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received counterparts
hereof signed by each of the other parties hereto. If any signature is
delivered by PDF, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation
of the party executing (or on whose behalf the signature is executed) with the
same force and effect as if such PDF signature was an original thereof.

 



 

SECTION 18. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Annex hereto,
any written amendments to the foregoing satisfying the requirements of Section
24, and the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, constitute
the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all other understandings and
negotiations with respect thereto. The parties agree to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations with respect to such understanding and the
transactions contemplated thereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of the Agreement, and the parties expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. The Annex hereto is hereby incorporated
in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any terms
used in the Annex but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set
forth in this Agreement or the Stock Purchase Agreement, as the case may be.
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
(including the Annex hereto), on the one hand, and the provisions of the Stock
Purchase Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits thereto), on the
other hand, the provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement shall control.

 



 

SECTION 19. _Severability_. In the event that any provision contained in this
Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective as to such
jurisdiction to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without invalidating or affecting the remaining provisions hereof or affecting
the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 20. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of the Agreement and any disputes arising under or related hereto
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
without reference to its conflicts of law principles.

 



 

SECTION 21. _Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding
against them arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or disputes relating hereto
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise) shall be
brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the state
courts of New York located in New York County, and hereby irrevocably accepts
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the aforesaid courts
__in_ _personam__ with respect to any such Proceeding and waives to the
fullest extent permitted by law any objection that it may now or hereafter
have that any such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

SECTION 22. _Service of Process_. Each of the parties consents to service of
any process, summons, notice or document which may be served in any Proceeding
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or
the state courts of New York located in New York County, which service may be
made by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, or as otherwise
provided in Section 15, to such partys respective address set forth in
Section 11.04 of the Stock Purchase Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 23. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect
to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or disputes relating hereto or thereto. Each party (a) certifies that
no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 23.

 



 

SECTION 24. _Amendments and Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended, modified,
superseded or canceled and any of the terms, covenants, representations,
warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by or on behalf of
the party waiving compliance. No course of dealing between the parties shall
be effective to amend or waive any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 25. _Independent Contractor_. At all times during the term of this
Agreement, Service Provider and each of its affiliates shall be independent
contractors in providing the Services hereunder with the sole right to
supervise, manage, operate, control and direct the performance of the Services
and the sole obligation to employ, compensate and manage their employees and
business affairs. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed or
construed to create a partnership or joint venture, to create the
relationships of employee/employer or principal/agent, or otherwise create any
liability whatsoever of any party

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to the indebtedness, liabilities, obligations or actions of the
other party or any of its respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives, or any other person or entity.

 



 

SECTION 26. _Survival_. The provisions of Sections 1, 4(b), 8(c), 10, 11, 12,
29, 30 and 31, as well as the related provisions of Sections 13-26, shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reason
whatsoever.

 



 

SECTION 27. _Force Majeure_. Service Provider shall not be in default
hereunder by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its
obligations hereunder where such failure or delay is due to a Force Majeure
Event. " _Force Majeure Event_ " means any event beyond Service Providers
reasonable control that cannot be avoided with the exercise of reasonable
diligence that prevents or delays Service Provider from performing its
obligations hereunder, including strikes, labor disputes, civil disturbances,
riot, rebellion, invasion, epidemic, hostilities, war, terrorism, embargo,
natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, accident, delay in
transportation, loss and destruction of property, intervention by Governmental
Entities, change in Laws, regulations or orders, other events or any other
circumstances or causes beyond Service Providers control. Service Provider
will promptly notify Service Recipient in writing upon learning of the
occurrence of any Force Majeure Event. In any such Force Majeure Event,
Service Providers and Service Recipients obligations hereunder shall be
postponed for such time as the performance is prevented or delayed on account
thereof; _provided_ , that Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resume provision of Services as promptly as reasonably practicable
or to identify and implement a commercially reasonable alternative to minimize
any interruption in the provision of Services hereunder. If Service Provider
does not identify and implement such alternative, Service Recipient may obtain
a replacement service from a third party at no greater cost than is provided
for such Service in the Annex plus ten percent (10%), and Service Provider
shall be responsible for the cost of any such replacement service, less the
amount Service Recipient is required to pay pursuant to this Agreement for the
Service that was replaced. Upon the cessation of the Force Majeure Event,
Service Provider and Service Recipient will use commercially reasonable
efforts to resume their performance as soon as reasonably practicable (subject
to complying with any contractual agreements made with any provider of
replacement services).

 



 

SECTION 28. _Warranties_. Service Provider has not made any express or implied
warranty with respect to the Services or any intellectual property license
hereunder, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

(collectively and together with all intellectual property rights therein and

affiliates, on the one hand, and Service Recipient and its affiliates, on the
other hand, will be solely and exclusively owned by Service Provider and/or
its affiliates; _provided_ that, if any Work Product is created, developed,
written or authored by Service Provider, its affiliates or any their
respective personnel solely for Service Recipient or its affiliates and at
Service Recipients cost and expense (such Work Product, " _Service Recipient
Work Product_ "), all right, title and interest throughout the world in and to
all such Service Recipient Work Product shall vest solely in Service Recipient
unconditionally and immediately upon such Service Recipient Work Product
having been created, developed, written or authored unless the parties agree
otherwise in writing. To the extent Service Recipient Work Product would not
vest by operation of law in Service Recipient, Service Provider on behalf of
itself and its affiliates shall assign and hereby assigns to Service Recipient
all of its and their rights, title and interests in and to such Service
Recipient Work Product.

 



 

(b) If any modification or enhancements are made, conceived or reduced to
practice by Service Provider to any Service Recipient Work Product in the
performance of the Services, all right, title and interest throughout the
world in and to all modifications and enhancements to such Service Recipient
Work Product shall vest solely in Service Recipient unconditionally and
immediately upon having been made, conceived or so reduced. To the extent such
modifications or enhancements made, conceived or reduced to practice by
Service Provider would not vest by operation of law in Service Recipient,
Service Provider on behalf of itself and its affiliates shall assign and
hereby assigns to Service Recipient all of its and their rights, title and
interests in and to such modifications or enhancements.

 



 

(c) Upon Service Provider and/or its affiliates reasonable request and at
their expense, Service Recipient shall take such actions as reasonably
requested by Service Provider and/or its affiliate to effectuate such
assignment and/or to prosecute, perfect, procure, protect, enforce, defend or
maintain any of Service Providers rights in or to any of the Work Product of
Service Provider in accordance with Section 29(a). In the event Service
Recipient has any rights, title or interests in or to any such Work Product of
Service Provider, Service Recipient shall assign and hereby assigns to Service
Provider all such rights, title and interests in and to such Work Product.

 



 

(d) Upon the termination of any of the Services, (i) Service Recipient will
return to Service Provider or its affiliates, as applicable, as soon as
practicable but in no event later than 15 days following such termination, any
equipment or other property of Service Provider or its affiliates, as
applicable, relating to such terminated Services which is owned or leased by
Service Provider or any of its affiliates, as applicable, and is, or was, in
Service Recipients possession or control; and (ii) Service Provider will
return or cause to be returned to Service Recipient, as soon as practicable
but in no event later than 15 days following such termination, any and all
supporting, back-up or organizational data or information owned by Service
Recipient that is in tangible form and in Service Providers or its
affiliates possession or control and was used by Service Provider or its
affiliate in supplying the Service to Service Recipient.

if any, related to accessing the other partys data in connection with this
Agreement or such Service, as applicable, (ii) return to such other party any
other data (as well as any and all back-up of that data) pertaining solely to
the other party and, if applicable, related to such Service, (iii) delete or
remove such data from such partys applicable computer systems, and (iv)
confirm that all Migration Services or all Migration Services with respect to
such Service, as applicable, have been performed in accordance with Section
2(h) and completed.

 



 

(f) All systems, procedures and related materials provided to Service
Recipient by or on behalf of Service Provider or any of its affiliates are for
Service Recipients internal use only and only as related to the applicable
Service. Service Recipient may copy, modify, use, distribute, perform,
display, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, make derivative works of or
in any way alter any software, hardware, data, databases or maintenance or
support components, Work Product or intellectual property of Service Provider
or any of its affiliates, or any portions of any of the foregoing, in each
case, only to the extent Service Recipient has received a copy thereof in
connection with the Services. Otherwise, Service Recipient may not do so
without Service Providers express prior written consent (as may be granted or
withheld in Service Providers sole and absolute discretion).

 



 

SECTION 30. _Joint Drafting_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel in the negotiations and preparation of this Agreement; therefore, this
Agreement will be deemed to have been drafted jointly by each of the parties
hereto, and no rule of construction will be invoked respecting the authorship
of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 31. _Confidentiality._ Each party hereto shall, and shall cause its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to, keep all confidential
information (" _Confidential Information_ ") regarding the business, affairs
or plans of the other party hereto and its affiliates provided pursuant to
this Agreement strictly confidential and maintain and protect all such
information in no less careful a manner than it maintains and protects its own
Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ , that such information may
be disclosed by such party if such disclosure is required by applicable law or
requested by a Governmental Authority (it being understood that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, such party shall give the other party hereto
advance written notice of such requirement (in an amount of time in advance of
such disclosure that is reasonable under the circumstances) to enable the
other party hereto to seek a protective order, confidential treatment or other
remedy, if possible); _provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions of this
Section 31 shall not apply to information that (1) becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such party or its
representatives, (2) was available to such party on a non-confidential basis
prior to its disclosure to such party pursuant to this Agreement or (3)
becomes available to such party on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the other party hereto.

 



 

SECTION 32. _Equitable Relief_. The parties acknowledge that a partys failure
to comply with the provisions of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm and
damage to other party for which no adequate remedy may be available at law.
Accordingly, the parties agree that

 



      
 

 



 

in addition to any other remedy to which a party may be entitled at law or in
equity, such party shall be entitled to injunctive relief, specific
performance or other equitable remedies to prevent breaches of and to enforce
specifically such provisions. The parties agree that prior to either party
commencing any proceeding to obtain injunctive relief, specific performance or
other equitable remedies, the parties shall attempt to resolve the underlying
failure to comply with the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with the
first sentence of _Section 10_ for a period of ten days following receipt of
the notice described in such sentence.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement as of the
date first written above.
