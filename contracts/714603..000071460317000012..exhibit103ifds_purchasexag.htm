and (b) recover any Losses from applicable insurance policies or third
parties.





Section 9.05 Indemnification Procedures. The Party making a claim under this
Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and the Party against
whom such claims are asserted under this Article IX is referred to as the
"Indemnifying Party".



(a)Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of any pending
or threatened Action made or brought by any Person who is not a Party or an
Affiliate of a Party or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party
Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice
thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and
only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail in light of the facts available to
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control
the defense of any such Third Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnified
Party has not been advised in writing by counsel that such claim involves a
conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party of its
decision to control the defense of a Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days
of its receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party,
or the Indemnifying Party is not permitted pursuant to the proviso of the
preceding sentence to control the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to control the defense of such Third
Party Claim, subject to the last sentence of Section 9.05(b). The Indemnified
Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to,
cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third
Party Claim.



(b) Settlement of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third Party Claim unless such settlement (a) provides, in customary form, for
the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and
obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and (b) entails the
payment by the Indemnifying Party of monetary damages as the sole relief for
the claimant. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to
Section 9.05(a), it shall not agree to any settlement without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably
prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later than thirty (30)
days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The



Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall
allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including, if applicable, access to
the Indemnified Party's premises and personnel and the right to examine and
copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of
its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

Section 9.06 No Recourse. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to the this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, execution of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents), may be made only against (and
are limited to) the entities that are expressly identified as parties in the
preamble to this Agreement, as applicable ("Contracting Parties"). No Person
who is not a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future
Representative, equityholder or controlling person of any Contracting Party,
or any Representative of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Nonparty
Affiliates"), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law
or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, or in connection with, or
related in any manner to, this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, or
based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents, or their negotiation, execution, performance, or breach, and, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each Contracting Party hereby
waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and
obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates.



Section 9.07 Exclusive Remedies. Except as provided in Section 11.11 (Specific
Performance), following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this
Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Indemnified Party
for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise, and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability or otherwise) that such
Person may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of,
or in connection with, any breach of or inaccuracy with respect to any
representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in any schedule or
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or any breach or failure by
a Party thereto to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement set forth
herein and therein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each Party retains all of its rights and remedies with respect to
claims based upon circumstances constituting fraud or intentional
misrepresentation.





Section 9.08 Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or
finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business Days
of such final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

Agreement as a whole. Unless the context otherwise requires, references
herein: (x) to Articles and Sections mean the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement; (y) to an agreement, instrument or other document means such
agreement, instrument or other document as amended, supplemented and modified
from time to time to the extent permitted by the provisions thereof; and (z)
to a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. This
Agreement shall be construed without regard to any presumption or rule
requiring construction or interpretation against the Party drafting an
instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.





Section 11.04 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for reference only
and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 11.06 Severability. If any term or provision (or portion thereof) of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision (or portion thereof) of this Agreement or invalidate or render
unenforceable such term or provision (or portion thereof) in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision (or
portion thereof) is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.



Section 11.06 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Transaction Documents
constitute the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the
subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with
respect to such subject matter.



Section 11.07 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No Party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No assignment shall relieve the assigning
Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this Section 11.07 shall be null and void.



Section 11.08 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Article IX,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Indemnitees shall be express
third party beneficiaries of Article IX, (b) the Nonparty Affiliates shall be
express third party beneficiaries of Section 9.06, (c) the State Street
Released Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of Section

amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by each

effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so
waiving. No waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in
respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such
written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether
occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement
shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.



Section 11.10 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.



(a)This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction).

(b)Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the Transaction may be instituted
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court in any such suit, action or proceeding. Service of process,
summons, notice or other document by mail to such Party's address set forth
herein shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or other
proceeding brought in such court. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action or any
proceeding in such court and irrevocably waive and agree not to plead or claim
in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

(c)EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 11.10(C).



Section 11.11 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof and to an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties further waives (a) any
defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

Section 11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.
