 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_.

 



 

(a) _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " **Company Common Stock** ") held
by the Company as treasury stock or held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment
shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, "
**Canceled Shares** ").

 



 

(ii) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, (A) $34.10 per share
in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash, the " **Cash
Consideration** ") and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, such shares of Parent Common Stock and
any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash
Consideration, the " **Merger Consideration** "). Each share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (the " **Certificates** ") or book-entry shares (" **Book-Entry
Shares** "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iii) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully
paid share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section
2.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All fractional
shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise
entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to
three (3) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder
of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such fractional
shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down
to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional
share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would,
but for this _Section 2.1(c)_, be entitled under _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ and
(ii) the Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in
lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange
Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the holders of
Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. The payment of cash in
lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ is not a
separately bargained-for consideration.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_
through the Exchange Agent, (i) book-entry shares (or certificates if
requested) representing the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay
the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable,
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration
provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, the " **Exchange Fund** "). For purposes
of the deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to Exchange Agent,
for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be
insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with
the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.1_, except as
expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and, in no event
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of

 



      
 

 



 

transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall
pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be
in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and Company may reasonably specify) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange
for (A) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, (C) any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ and (D) cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant
to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as
reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, (ii) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form unless a
certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ , (iii) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ and (iv)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ , and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_ , each Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from
and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_ and
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to applicable
Law, following surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, there
shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without interest, (i) at the time of
delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at

 



      
 

 



 

the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such
Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, and a
payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section
2.2(d)_) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its
designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.2(d)_.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which
any Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such
investment shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments
required by this _Article II_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as
directed by Parent.

 



 

(i) _Withholding_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement to any former holder of Company Common Stock or holder of Company
Equity Awards such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the
Exchange Agent.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Awards_. Except as set forth in
_Section 2.3(a)(ii)_, Parent shall not assume any award of Company Common
Stock subject to time-based, performance or other vesting or lapse
restrictions (each a " **Company Restricted Stock Award** ") or substitute for
any Company Restricted Stock Award any similar award of Parent Common Stock,
in connection with the Merger.

 



 

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) each Company Restricted
Stock Award that was granted prior to the date of this Agreement and that
remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, to the
extent not vested, become fully vested; _provided_ that to the extent that
such award is subject to performance conditions, any performance conditions
shall be deemed to have been satisfied at the maximum level and (B) each
Company Restricted Stock Award shall be canceled without any action on the
part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in consideration for the right to
receive a lump sum cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of
(1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Company Restricted Stock Award, less any applicable
withholding or other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be
withheld; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment in respect of any Company
Restricted Stock Award which immediately prior to such cancellation was
treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code shall
be made on the applicable settlement date for such Company Restricted Stock
Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code. For the
purpose of the preceding sentence, the portion of the Merger Consideration
that consists of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be converted to a lump
sum cash payment equal to the product of (x) the number of such shares of
Parent Common Stock and (y) the Parent Stock Price.

 



 

(ii) Except as provided in _Section 2.3(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time each Company Restricted
Stock Award that is granted by the Company on or following the date of this
Agreement and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall, without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be assumed
by Parent and converted into a restricted stock award of Parent covering that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted Stock Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ that to the extent that such Company Restricted Stock Award
is subject to performance conditions, any performance conditions shall be
deemed to have been

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied at the target level performance with respect to the applicable
performance period and shall be subject to the time-based vesting schedule
applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award and will be settled as
provided in the award agreement applicable to such Company Restricted Stock
Award, subject only to the continued service of the grantee with the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or an Affiliate through each applicable vesting date
(except to the extent that the applicable award agreement provides for
accelerated vesting in connection with termination of service or a change in
control occurring after the Effective Time) but shall not be subject to any
performance metrics following the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_. Except as set forth in _Section
2.3(b)(ii)_ below, Parent shall not assume any restricted stock unit awards,
including any stock unit held under the Company 2010 Deferred Compensation
Plan (each a " **Company RSU Award** "), or substitute for any Company RSU
Award any similar award for Parent Common Stock, in connection with the
Merger.

 



 

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A) each Company RSU Award
subject to time-based, performance or other vesting restrictions that was
granted prior to the date of this Agreement and that remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, to the extent not vested,
become fully vested; _provided_ that to the extent that such award is subject
to performance conditions, any performance conditions shall be deemed to have
been satisfied at the maximum level and (B) each such Company RSU Award,
whether payable in cash or shares of Company Common Stock, shall be canceled
without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in
consideration for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment with respect
thereto equal to the product of (1) the Merger Consideration and (2) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Company RSU
Award, less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other amounts
required by applicable Law to be withheld; _provided_ , _further_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of any such Company RSU Award which immediately prior to
such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation" subject to Section
409A of the Code shall be made on the applicable settlement date for such
Company RSU Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the
Code. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the portion of the Merger
Consideration that consists of shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
converted to a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of (x) the number of
such shares of Parent Common Stock and (y) the Parent Stock Price.

 



 

(ii) Except as provided in _Section 2.3(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter_, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time each Company RSU Award
that is granted by the Company on or following the date of this Agreement and
that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be assumed by Parent
and converted into a restricted stock unit award of Parent covering that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that to the extent that such Company RSU Award is
subject to performance conditions, any performance conditions shall be deemed
to have been satisfied at the target level performance with respect to the
applicable performance period and shall be subject to the time-based vesting
schedule applicable to such Company RSU Award and will be settled as provided
in the award agreement applicable to such Company RSU Award, subject only to
the continued service of the grantee with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
an Affiliate through each applicable vesting date (except to the extent that
the applicable award agreement provides for accelerated vesting in connection
with termination of service or a change in control occurring after the
Effective Time) but shall not be subject to any performance metrics following
the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Company DSU Awards_. Each stock unit credited to the account
of any current or former non-employee director (or beneficiary thereof) under
the B/E Aerospace, Inc. Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors Stock and
Deferred Compensation Plan (the " **Non-Employee Directors Plan** ") that is
payable in shares of Company Common Stock (each a " **Company DSU Award** ")
and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
immediately converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time the
Merger Consideration, less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other
amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld; _provided_ that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of any Company DSU Award which immediately prior to such

administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such
other necessary actions such that (i) with respect to any Option Period(s) (as
such term is defined in the Company ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement under the Company ESPP, such Option Period(s) shall terminate and

have been exercised upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4)

Equity Plan, obtain any necessary consents, adopt applicable resolutions,
amend the terms of the Company Equity Plan or any outstanding awards, and take
all other appropriate actions to give effect to the transactions contemplated
herein. To the extent such notice or actions are required, the Company shall
provide Parent with documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing
actions (the form and substance of such documentation shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) not later than the Business Day preceding the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn
or lost such holders rights to appraisal (the " **Dissenting Shares** "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it
being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto other than the right to receive the "fair value" of such
Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal
and payment under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the
Effective Time), such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such
shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal demands,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to or settle or compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any such demand or Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If

 



       
 

 



 

Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer following the Effective Time, they
shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as
provided for in _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger, the officers and managers of Parent shall be fully authorized (in
the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise)
to take such action.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished
to) the SEC by the Company on or after December 31, 2014 and prior to the date
of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any risk factor disclosure
contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual information
contained therein) or in any "forward-looking statements" legend or in any
similarly non-specific, predictive or forward-looking statements) and to the
extent publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and
Retrieval System (" **EDGAR** ") or (ii) as disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, formation or organization, as
applicable, and has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and
assets are currently operated, except where the failure to be so validly
existing and authorized has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (the " **Certificate of Incorporation** ") and Amended and
Restated Bylaws (the " **Bylaws** "), each as amended as of the date of this
Agreement, have been made available to Parent and are currently in effect, and
the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions thereof, and the
organizational or governing documents of each of the Companys Subsidiaries,
each as amended as of the date of this Agreement, are currently in effect, and
none of such Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the respective provisions
thereof, except, in each case, where such failure or violation has not been,

 



      
 

 



 

and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) As of the close of business on October 17, 2016 (the " **Capitalization
Date** "), the authorized capital stock of the Company consisted of (i)
200,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 101,603,153 of which were issued

were held by the Company as treasury stock, and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of
preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (" **Company
Preferred Stock** "), no shares of which were outstanding. There are no other
classes of capital stock of the Company and no bonds, debentures, notes or
other Indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible

were (A) no outstanding Company Options to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock, (B) outstanding Company Restricted Stock Awards representing 1,480,641

Company Preferred Stock or any other equity or voting interests in the Company
other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
exercise, vesting or settlement, as applicable, of the Company Equity Awards
outstanding as of the close of business on the Capitalization Date in
accordance with the terms of such Company Equity Awards or under the Company
ESPP in accordance with its terms and (ii) any Company Equity Awards or any
other equity or equity-based awards.

3.2(a)_, there are no (i) existing options, warrants, calls, preemptive
rights, subscriptions or other rights, restricted stock awards, restricted
stock unit awards, convertible securities, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any kind obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

preemptive, subscriptions or other rights, restricted stock awards, restricted
stock unit awards, convertible securities, agreements, arrangements or
commitments, (ii) outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its

listed on _Section 3.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter_. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, the Company owns,

Section 3.6 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2014, the Company has timely filed with (or furnished
to) the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, the " **Company SEC Documents** "). As of
its filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Company SEC
Document complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing
date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange
Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no amendments or
modifications to the Company SEC Documents that were required to be filed with
(or furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, but that have
not yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of the
Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
All of the audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial
statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i) comply in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except,
in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under
Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the financial position, the stockholders equity, the results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the times and for the periods referred to therein (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

 



 

(b) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent complete and correct copies
of all comment letters from the SEC since December 31, 2014 through the date
of this Agreement with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents, together
with all written responses of the Company thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents,
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents are
subject to ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
designed to provide

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
conformity with GAAP. The Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document
that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. Based on the Companys most recent evaluation of
internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement,
(i) the Company has no "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as
such terms are defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other inquiries or investigations by
Governmental Authorities or internal investigations pending or threatened, in
each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2014 through the date
of this Agreement, there have been no material internal investigations
regarding accounting or revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or
initiated at the direction of the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer or general counsel, the Company Board or any committee thereof.

 



 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to the Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company does not
have, and has not arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Since December 31, 2014, (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
oral complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls, auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or unlawful accounting or auditing
matters with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) no
attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof
or to the general counsel or chief executive officer of the Company pursuant
to the rules of the SEC adopted under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
except, in each case, as has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, on
the other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Company SEC Documents (including any audited financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included
therein).

 



 

Section 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2014
through the date of this Agreement, (a) except in connection with the

Section 4.6 _Parent SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2014, Parent has timely filed with (or furnished to)
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, the " **Parent SEC Documents** "). As of its
filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Parent SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date
or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last
such amendment, each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not

 



      
 

 



 

misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no amendments or
modifications to Parent SEC Documents that were required to be filed with (or
furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, but that have not
yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of Parent is
subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. All of the
audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of
Parent included in Parent SEC Documents (i) comply in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except, in the case of
the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the
Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the financial
position, the stockholders equity, the results of operations and cash flows
of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the times and for the
periods referred to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments).

 



 

(b) Parent has heretofore furnished to the Company complete and correct copies
of all comment letters from the SEC since December 31, 2014 through the date
of this Agreement with respect to any of the Parent SEC Documents, together
with all written responses of Parent thereto. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
received from the SEC staff with respect to any of Parent SEC Documents, and,
to the Knowledge of Parent, none of Parent SEC Documents are subject to
ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
conformity with GAAP. Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of Parents
internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on Parents most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) Parent has no
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined
in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,

 



      
 

 



 

processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
SEC inquiries or investigations, other inquiries or investigations by
Governmental Authorities or internal investigations pending or threatened, in
each case regarding any accounting practices of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive officer of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2014 through the date of this
Agreement, there have been no material internal investigations regarding
accounting or revenue recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at
the direction of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or
general counsel, the Parent Board or any committee thereof.

 



 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer of Parent and the principal
financial officer of Parent (or each former principal executive officer of
Parent and each former principal financial officer of Parent, as applicable)
has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect
to Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications
are true and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent does not have, and has not
arranged any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(h) Since December 31, 2014, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, oral complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls, auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, or unlawful accounting or auditing matters with
respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) no attorney representing
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities Laws,
breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Parent Board or any committee thereof or to the general counsel
or chief executive officer of Parent pursuant to the rules of the SEC adopted
under Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except, in each case, as has not
been, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 



 

(i) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, on the
other hand), including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act), where the result,
purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any

 



       
 

 



 

of its Subsidiaries in Parent SEC Documents (including any audited financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of Parent included

to do any of the foregoing; (iii) the Company shall not provide and shall,
within one (1) Business Day of the date of this Agreement, terminate access of
any third party to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any of the

agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement, commitment, arrangement or understanding contemplating or
otherwise in connection with, or that is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a

the Company Board receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith constitutes a Company Superior Proposal that
was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced
or otherwise procured in violation of this Agreement, the Company Board may
(i) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_ in order to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Company Superior Proposal

available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) with Parents Representatives any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such
action would no longer be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to any material term or condition of any Company Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the
later to occur of (1) two (2) days following delivery of such new notice from
the Company to Parent and (2) the expiration of the original four (4)-day
period described in clause (D) above); and (E) no earlier than the end of such
negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that (x) the Company Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of
the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.6(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.6(e)_), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval the Company
Board may take any action in response to a Company Intervening Event
prohibited by clause (i) of _Section 5.6(c)_, only if (i) the Company Board
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; (ii) the Company
has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect such a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_ (which notice
shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Company
Intervening Event and for the Company Boards determination to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in reasonable detail); (iii) for a
period of four (4) days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii)
of this _Section 5.6(e)_, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in
good faith and made the Companys Representatives available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate), with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts
and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that
shall expire on the

 



      
 

 



 

later to occur of (A) two (2) days following delivery of such new notice from
the Company to Parent and (B) the expiration of the original four (4)-day
period described above in this clause (iii)); and (iv) no earlier than the end
of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith, after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification
to this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board determines in good faith that the failure of the Company Board to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) in no event shall this
_Section 5.6(f)_ affect the obligations specified in _Section 5.6(d)_ or
_5.6(e)_ and (2) any such disclosure (other than issuance by the Company of a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board
with respect to this Agreement or a Company Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board
in connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of the Company Board, without disclosing any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that (x) the Parent

in reasonable detail); (iii) for a period of four (4) days following the
notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 5.7(e)_, Parent

any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take
such action would no longer be inconsistent with the Parent Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed that any material
change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and
a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two
(2) days following delivery of such new notice from Parent to the Company and
(B) the expiration of the original four (4)-day period described above in this
clause (iii)); and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period,
the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, after considering the
terms of any

 



      
 

 



 

proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to take
such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent
Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a

thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Parent
Board determines in good faith that the failure of the Parent Board to make
such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that (1) in no event shall this
_Section 5.7(f)_ affect the obligations specified in _Section 5.7(d)_ or
_Section 5.7(e)_ and (2) any such disclosure (other than issuance by Parent
of a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the

deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Parent Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of the Parent Board, without disclosing any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change.

the same extent as such Covered Employee received, immediately before the
Effective Time, credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan
in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective
Times shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to

affect the Companys right to receive any Parent Termination Fee otherwise due
under _Section 7.3(b)_, but shall reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any
Parent Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under _Section 7.3(b)_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall either the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, on more than one occasion.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Company Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ and/or the right to receive payment of the
Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, shall, in circumstances in
which the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) are owed,
constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy (other than (i) in the event
of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)(B)_ and _(C)_ , (ii) in the
event of an intentional breach by the Company of _Section 5.15_ or a
fraudulent breach of _Section 3.27_ and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Parents right, after having received the Parent Expenses, to receive
the Company Termination Fee less the Parent Expenses in the circumstances
expressly contemplated in _Section 7.3(a)_) of Parent and Merger Sub against
the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current
or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives or assignees
(collectively, the " **Company Related Parties** ") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to any amounts
owing pursuant to _Section 7.3(g)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, the Companys right to receive payment from
Parent of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(b)_ and/or the
right to receive payment of the Company Expenses pursuant to _Section
7.3(d)_, shall, in circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee or
Company Expenses (as applicable) are owed, constitute the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy (other than (i) in the event of a termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)(B)_ and _(C)_ , (ii) in the event of an intentional
breach by Parent of _Section 5.15_ or a fraudulent breach of _Section

the circumstances expressly contemplated in _Section 7.3(b)_) of the Company
against Parent and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Representatives or assignees
(collectively, the " **Parent Related Parties** ") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(except that Parent shall also be obligated with respect to any amounts owing
pursuant to _Section 7.3(g)_ ).

 



 

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, the parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as applicable,
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other for the payment
of any amount set forth in this _Section 7.3_, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall pay the other its costs and expenses in connection with such
suit (including reasonable attorneys fees), together with interest on such
amount at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is
the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Company Stockholder Approval or Parent Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange

 



      
 

 



 

requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, without such further approval of such stockholders nor any
amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_
, that no amendment to this Agreement shall be made that would adversely
affect the rights of the Financing Sources as set forth in this _Section 7.4_
or _Sections 8.8_, _8.13_ or _8.14_ without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

 



 

(a) The parties have participated collectively in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
collectively by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or

the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall

deemed to include business entities and vice versa and references to a Person
are also to its permitted successors and assigns. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and terms or phrases of similar import
shall be deemed to refer to October 23, 2016, unless the context requires

regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case, as of such date). All
references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger
be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that any Merger Sub may assign any
or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to one or more
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent, or a combination
thereof so long as such assignment would not delay, impair or prevent
consummation of the Merger or otherwise have a Parent Material Adverse Effect
and Parent continues to remain liable for all of such obligations as if no
such assignment had occurred. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any
attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 8.6_ shall be null and
void.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the
entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is specifically
intended that (a) the DandO Indemnified Parties (with respect to _Section 5.8_
and this _Section 8.8_ from and after the Effective Time), (b) from and after
the Effective time, the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards (with respect to _Article II_) and (c) each Financing Source (solely
with respect to this _Section 8.8_ and _Sections 7.4_ , _8.13_ and _8.14_
hereof) are each intended third-party beneficiaries hereof.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any

 



      
 

 



 

party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby, with respect to any legal claim or
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) expressly and irrevocably submits, for itself and with
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such courts, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except in such courts and (iv) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any claim or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final and
nonappealable judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 



 

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any claim or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
hereof brought by any other party hereto may be made by mailing copies thereof
by registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 8.3_ and
such service of process shall be sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction
over such party in such claim or Proceeding and shall otherwise constitute
effective and binding service in every respect.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed

COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
BETWEEN ANY OF THEM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT
TO ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM THAT INVOLVES THE FINANCING SOURCES.**

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8.14 _Certain Claims_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any Proceeding
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources
in any way relating to this Agreement or the Merger, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to any commitment letter, engagement
letter or definitive financing document in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable Law, exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof). The parties hereto further agree that all of the
provisions of _Section 8.13_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to
any Proceeding referenced in this _Section 8.14(a)_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto agrees that all Proceedings (whether based on contract,
tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or the Merger, including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing
document in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or the performance thereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of New York; _provided_ , _however_ , that on or
prior to the Closing Date, the definitions of Company Material Adverse Effect
and the representations set forth in this Agreement shall, for the purposes of
any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection
with or related to this Agreement, the Merger or any commitment letter,
engagement letter or definitive financing document in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any alternative financing in
connection therewith. In addition, no Financing Source shall have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates or
Representatives in connection with or related to this Agreement, the Merger or
any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing document in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including for
any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including
any loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious
nature. Nothing in this _Section 8.14(c)_ shall modify or alter the rights of
Parent under any commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing
document in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries and any Financing Source
entered into in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement, and in
the event of a conflict between the foregoing and any provision in any
commitment letter, engagement letter or any such definitive financing
documentation, as applicable, the provisions

 



      
 

 



 

of such commitment letter, engagement letter or definitive financing
documentation, as applicable, shall govern and control.

 



 

(d) In executing any certificate or other documentation in connection with
this Agreement, directors, officers and employees of Parent and the Company
