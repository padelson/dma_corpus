transmittal in order to receive any cash to which such Person is entitled
pursuant to this Article III.

the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the record
holders of Shares as of the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares) for 12

thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any record holder of Shares as of the Effective
Time for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. All cash paid upon the
surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates.

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, the
Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under this Article
III; provided that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its respective
discretion



and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the record
holder of such Certificate to deliver a bond in customary amount or an
indemnity on terms reasonably requested by Parent or the Paying Agent.

(g) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Shares which are held by a shareholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (the "Dissenting Shares")
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
351.455 of the MGBCL (the "Dissenting Shareholders"), shall not be converted
into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled only to such rights
as are accorded under Section 351.455 of the MGBCL (and at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 351.455 of
the MGBCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost its right to appraisal under the MGBCL. If
any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's Shares shall thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted into the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the applicable Merger Consideration for each such Share, in
accordance with Section 3.1, without interest. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demand for appraisal or attempted withdrawal of such
demand that is received by the Company relating to Company shareholders'
rights of appraisal. Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal by Company
shareholders under the MGBCL. Except to the extent required by applicable Law,
the Company shall not voluntarily offer to make or make any payment with
respect to any demand for appraisal without the prior written consent of
Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled, without duplication, to deduct and
withhold from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the
"Code"), or any other applicable state, local or non­U.S. tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be (i) timely remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority,
and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

Section 3.3 Treatment of RSUs. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if applicable, a committee of Company Board) shall take such actions as
are necessary to cause each outstanding RSU to become fully vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time: (a) each RSU Holder's RSUs
shall be cancelled and extinguished in exchange for the right to receive an
amount, in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Common Merger
Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of RSUs held by such RSU Holder
(the "RSU Merger Consideration"), subject to such RSU Holder's fulfillment of
the requirements set forth in this Section 3.3 and less withholdings for any
applicable Taxes; and (b) each RSU Holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the RSU Merger Consideration. In
order to receive the RSU Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
3.3, an RSU Holder must provide the Company with an executed written consent
to the treatment of such RSU Holder's RSUs in accordance with this Section 3.3
prior to the Effective Time. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company will
provide each RSU Holder with the form of written consent for execution by such
RSU Holder prior to the Effective Time.



Section 3.4 Treatment of Warrants. At the Effective Time, each warrant to
purchase shares of Common Stock that is listed on Section 3.4 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, the "Warrants"), will be cancelled with the
consent of the holder thereof in exchange for the right to receive an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to the product of: (a) the aggregate number
of Common Shares in respect of such Warrant; multiplied by (b) the excess of
the Common Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price under such
Warrant (the "Warrant Merger Consideration").

Section 3.5 Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of
capital stock of the Company as permitted by this Agreement), including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange, readjustment of shares, or
similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock, the
applicable Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article IV are true and correct except (i) as set

schedule delivered by the Company to Parent at or before the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule").
The Company Disclosure Schedule is arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this

Company that the statements contained in this Article V are true and correct.

Section 5.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and conduct its businesses as and where presently conducted, except
where the failure to have such power or authority, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder, and to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. The board of directors of
Parent has adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote of the directors present at
a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of Parent was present,
(a) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
(b) determining that entering into this Agreement is in the best interests of
Parent and its shareholders. As of the date of this Agreement, such
resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. The board of directors of
Merger Sub has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement; (ii) determining that the terms of
this Agreement are in the best interests of Merger Sub and Parent, as its sole
shareholder; (iii) declaring this Agreement advisable; and (iv) recommending
that Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, adopt this Agreement and
directing that this Agreement be submitted to Parent, as sole shareholder of
Merger Sub, for adoption. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions
have not been amended or withdrawn. No other corporate proceedings (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, any shareholder approval) on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this
Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions (except for
the filing of the Summary Articles of Merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the MGBCL). Each of Parent and Merger Sub has duly executed and
delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and
binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms
except, in each case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity.



Section 5.3 No Conflicts; Consents.

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement does not, and the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or (solely with
respect to clause (ii)) give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
of the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any provision of:
(i) the governing or organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii)
any Contract to which any of Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which any
of their respective properties or assets is bound; or (iii) subject to the
filings and other matters referred to in Section 5.3(b), as of the date
hereof, any Order, Law or Permit, in each case, applicable to Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No Consents of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
made to or with any Governmental Authority, is required to be obtained or made
by or with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or its performance of its obligations hereunder
or the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, other than (i)
compliance with and filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), (ii) the filings required in connection with the
USFS Permits and (iii) such other matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.4 Litigation. There is no suit, action or other proceeding pending
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger Sub that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Order outstanding
against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental
Authority involving Parent or Merger Sub that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5 Brokers' Fees and Expenses. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's,
financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Merger or any of the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 5.6 Merger Sub. Parent is the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. Since
its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business nor
conducted any operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

Section 5.7 Ownership of Common Stock. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates has been, at any time during the five years prior
to the date hereof, an "interested shareholder" of the Company, as defined in
Section 351.459 of the MGBCL. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Parent
or Merger Sub owns any shares of capital stock of the Company or has any
rights to acquire any shares of capital stock of the Company (except pursuant
to this Agreement).

Section 5.8 Sufficient Funds. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub's obligations
hereunder are subject to any conditions regarding Parent's, Merger Sub's or
any other Person's ability to obtain financing for the completion of the
Transactions. Parent has, and will have prior to the Effective Time,
sufficient cash, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately
available funds to consummate the Merger and any other Transactions, including
the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article III, and to
pay



any related fees and expenses, and there is not, nor will there be, any
restriction on the use of such cash or cash equivalents for such purpose.

Section 5.9 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article V or in any
certificate delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company (and
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the Company or its
Representatives of any documentation, projections, estimates, budgets or other
information), the Company acknowledges that (a) none of Parent, the
Subsidiaries of Parent (including Merger Sub) or any other Person on behalf of
Parent makes, or has made, any representation or warranty relating to itself
or its business or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or
the other Transactions and the Company is not relying on any representation or
warranty of any Person except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement
and (b) no person has been authorized by Parent, the Subsidiaries of Parent
(including Merger Sub) or any other Person on behalf of Parent to make any
representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement and Merger, and if made, such representation or
warranty shall not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been
authorized by such entity.

Section 6.2 Proxy Statement.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than ten Business Days from the date of this
Agreement), the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and file
with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement, letter to stockholders,
notice of meeting, form of proxy and related schedules and materials (together
with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement")
relating to the meeting of the Company's shareholders held for the purpose of
approving and adopting this Agreement and the Transactions, including the
Merger (the "Company Shareholders Meeting"). Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Proxy Statement, and such
information, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's
shareholders and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
to all SEC comments with respect



to the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt
thereof and file all necessary amendments thereto in connection with such SEC
comments. The Company shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to
the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for
any amendment to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
consult with Parent regarding, and provide Parent with copies of, all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of
the SEC) with respect thereto, or disseminating any other materials used in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting that (i) constitute "proxy
materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1
through 14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used
for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or
response and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
all such comments, but, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be
obligated to incorporate any such comments, unless such comments are necessary
to cause such documents to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The
Company shall as promptly as practicable (but, subject to setting a record
date pursuant to Section 6.3, in no event later than five (5) Business Days)
after the date on which the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) confirms that it
will not review or has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, commence
mailing to the Record Holders the Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials for the Company Shareholders Meeting, with such mailing to be
completed within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such confirmation
from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), subject to any additional time
required in connection with setting a record date pursuant to Section 6.3.

(b) At the time it is first mailed to the Company's shareholders and at the
time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall have caused the
Proxy Statement not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein not false or misleading in light of the circumstances under which they
are made. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations of
the Company with respect to this Section 6.2(b) do not extend to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein.

(c) If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information promptly shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

Section 6.3 Company Shareholders Meeting. Subject to Section 6.4, as soon as
reasonably practical after the date hereof, but by no later than 5:00PM
Eastern Time on August 1, 2019, the Company Board shall ratify by unanimous
action of the Company Board the Company Board Recommendation and deliver
written evidence of the same to Parent. The Company, acting through the
Company Board (or a committee thereof), shall (a) as soon as reasonably
practicable following confirmation by the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) that
it will not review or has no further comments on the Proxy Statement take all
action



necessary to set a record date for (which record date shall be as soon as
legally permissible), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting, the date of such Company Shareholder Meeting to be no
later than thirty days after the date the definitive Proxy Statement is first
disseminated to the Company's shareholders (unless such meeting is adjourned
in accordance with this Section 6.3), and (b) subject to Section 6.4, include
in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation, and solicit and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval at the
Company Shareholder Meeting. Unless the Agreement has been duly terminated in
accordance with the terms herein, the Company shall, subject to the right of
the Company Board to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
under the circumstances specified in Section 6.4(d), use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from the shareholders of the Company proxies in favor of
the proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the
Transactions and to secure the Company Shareholder Approval (it being
understood that the foregoing shall not require the Company Board to recommend
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, if a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change has been effected in accordance with Section 6.4(d)).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) if the
Company believes in good faith (after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel) that it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment
to the Proxy Statement that is legally required (including such an amendment
or supplement in response to an objection that is raised by any shareholder of
the Company to the sufficiency or accuracy of the Proxy Statement) is timely
provided to the shareholders of the Company or (ii) with the consent of
Parent, if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient shares of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented (either
in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Shareholders Meeting; provided, however, that any such
adjournment or postponement shall be for not more than, in the case of clause
(i), ten (10) Business Days, and in the case of clause (ii), twenty (20)
Business Days or such other amount of time reasonably agreed by Company and
Parent to be necessary to comply with applicable Law, and, in any event, shall
not be to a date that is later than three (3) Business Days prior to the End
Date. During any such period of adjournment or postponement, the Company shall
continue in all respects to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.3
and Section 6.4. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of
this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company's
shareholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the
Company Shareholders Meeting.

Section 6.4 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) The Company shall not and shall cause its directors, officers, employees
and the Company Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Affiliates and its and the Company Subsidiaries' respective other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, knowingly
facilitate or knowingly take any action to encourage the submission of any
Alternative Proposal or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Alternative Proposal, or, subject to Section 6.4(b):
(i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose or
afford access to any non-public information relating to the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, negotiations with Parent or the terms of this Agreement,
or assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any
effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, has made or could
reasonably be expected to make, any Alternative Proposal; (ii) amend or grant
any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect
to any class of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries;
(iii) approve, support, adopt, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal
or other transaction that is a "control share acquisition" under the MGBCL
with respect to the Company; (iv) take any action to make the provisions of
any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation inapplicable
to any Person other than Parent and its Affiliates or to any



transactions constituting or contemplated by an Alternative Proposal (or take
any action or fail to take any action that would make any anti-takeover
statute or similar regulation applicable to Parent); (v) enter into any
agreement, letter of intent, term sheet or other Contract relating to any
Alternative Proposal (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement") or (vi) resolve
or agree to do any of the foregoing. Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 6.4, the Company Board shall not effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change. The Company shall, and shall cause its directors,
officers, employees and the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions, or negotiations, if any, with any third
party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Proposal, and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause (and in any event
within 48 hours of the execution of this Agreement shall send written notice
demanding that) any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession
of non-public information in respect of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to return or destroy all such information.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a), prior to the receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company Board, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, may, subject to Section 6.4(c): (i) participate in
negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made (and not
withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Alternative Proposal made in writing after
the date hereof that did not result from a breach of Section 6.4(a) that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal; (ii) thereafter furnish to such
third party non-public information relating to the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement that
constitutes an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (provided that promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after it furnishes such
information to such third party) the Company makes available to Parent the
same information to the extent not previously provided to Parent and its
Representatives); or (iii) following receipt of and on account of a Superior
Proposal, and solely to the extent permitted by Sections 6.4(c) and 6.4(d),
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, but, in each case referred to in
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), only if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Company Board from
disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Alternative Proposal that is a tender offer, if the Company determines, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such
position would constitute a violation of applicable Law; provided that this
sentence shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change except to the extent expressly permitted by this Section
6.4.

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) through (iii) of Section 6.4(b) unless the Company shall have (i)
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action, (ii) promptly notified Parent (but in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) of any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Alternative Proposal, any request for non-public information
relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or for access to the
business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries by any third party in connection with an Alternative Proposal,
(iii) promptly notified Parent (but in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) in writing of the receipt of an Alternative Proposal, (iv) if the
Alternative Proposal is in writing, delivered to Parent a copy of the
Alternative Proposal and any draft agreements and other written material
received by the Company related to the Alternative Proposal, (v) if the
Alternative Proposal is oral, communicated to Parent the material terms and
conditions thereof. In any such notifications to Parent, the Company shall
identify the third party making the Alternative Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and
timely basis of the status, material terms and



discussions related to any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request,
including any material amendments or material proposed amendments as to price
and other material terms thereof.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.4(e), the Company Board shall
not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless: (i) the Company has
complied with its obligations set forth in this Section 6.4; (ii) the Company
promptly notifies Parent, privately and in writing, at least five (5) Business
Days before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (such period of at
least five (5) Business Days commencing upon delivery of such notice and
ending immediately prior to any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
"Superior Proposal Notice Period"), of its intention to take such action with
respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the
Company has received an Alternative Proposal that the Company Board intends to
declare a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case, absent any specific
revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, describing in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor (any such notice, including the
attachments contemplated in the following clause (iii), a "Superior Proposal
Notice"); (iii) the Company attaches to such Superior Proposal Notice the most
current version of all then current forms of all proposed transaction
documents, including any definitive agreements with respect to such Superior
Proposal, any financing commitments related thereto and the identity of the
third party making such Superior Proposal and its financing sources, if any;
(iv) during the Superior Proposal Notice Period, the Company makes its
Representatives reasonably available, negotiates with Parent in good faith,
and causes its Representatives to negotiate with Parent in good faith, to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Alternative Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in
its discretion, proposes in good faith to make such adjustments (it being
agreed that in the event that, after commencement of the Superior Proposal
Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of the applicable
Superior Proposal, including any revision in price or the form of
consideration, the Superior Proposal as modified by any such material revision
shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new Superior Proposal
Notice Period shall commence upon delivery of such new Superior Proposal
Notice, and, in such case, the Superior Proposal Notice Period shall be deemed
to be at least three (3) Business Days before the Company effects a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood that there may be multiple
Superior Proposal Notices and Superior Proposal Notice Periods)); (v) Parent
has not, during the applicable Superior Proposal Notice Period, made a written
bona fide offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement such that such Alternative Proposal would cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal; (vi) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor, that such Alternative Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the
Superior Proposal Notice Period to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
and (vii) in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
clause (b) of the definition thereof, the Company substantially concurrently
terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.3(a).

(e) In response to an Intervening Event that has occurred after the date of
this Agreement but prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (other
than pursuant to clause (b) of the definition thereof) if: (i) prior to
effecting the Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company promptly
notifies Parent, privately and in writing, at least five Business Days (the
"Intervening Event Notice Period") before taking such action of its intent to
consider such action (which notice shall not, by itself, constitute a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change), and which notice shall include a reasonably
detailed description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons
for taking, such action; (ii) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during the Intervening Event Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons
for taking such action, ceases to constitute an Intervening Event, if Parent,
in its discretion, proposes in good faith to make such adjustments (it being
agreed that in the event that, after



commencement of the Intervening Event Notice Period, there is any material
development in an Intervening Event, the Company shall notify Parent of such
material development and the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be
extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three Business Days remains
in the Intervening Event Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company
notifies Parent of any such material development); and (iii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consulting with outside legal counsel and
taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during the Intervening
Event Notice Period, that the failure to effect such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that
any Company Adverse Recommendation Change effected (or proposed to be
effected) in response to or in connection with any Alternative Proposal may be
made solely and exclusively pursuant to Section 6.4(d) only, and may not be
made pursuant to this Section 6.4(e), and any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change may only be made pursuant to this Section 6.4 and no other provisions
of this Agreement.

Section 6.5 Filings; Efforts to Consummate.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent and
the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to reasonably
promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate, and make effective as reasonably promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, the Transactions, including (i) preparing
and filing with a Governmental Authority as reasonably promptly as practicable
all applications, notices, petitions, filings, ruling requests, and other
documents necessary to consummate the Transactions and to obtain as reasonably
promptly as practicable all Consents necessary to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Transactions (collectively,
the "Governmental Approvals") and (ii) as reasonably promptly as practicable
taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such Governmental
Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to (A) make an appropriate and complete filing of a Notification
and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions
within ten Business Days of the date of this Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed by the parties, and (B) make all other filings that are required to be
made in order to consummate the Transactions pursuant to other Regulatory Laws
with respect to the Transactions as reasonably promptly as practicable. Parent
and the Company shall supply as reasonably promptly as practicable any
additional information or documentation that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and use its reasonable best efforts to
take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other Regulatory Law as soon as practicable (including complying with any
"second request" for information or similar request from a Governmental
Authority pursuant to other Regulatory Laws).

(b) In connection with the actions referenced in Section 6.5(a) to obtain all
Governmental Approvals for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall: (i) cooperate in all
respects with each other in connection with any communication, filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other
party and its counsel promptly informed of any communication received by such
party from, or given by such party to, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or
other Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions; (iii) consult with each other in advance of any meeting
or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other Governmental
Authority or other person, give the other party or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; and (iv) permit
the other party and its counsel to review in advance any submission, filing or
communication (and documents submitted therewith) intended to be given by it
to the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority; provided



that materials may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation
of the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material to be provided to the other under this
Section 6.5(b) as "Outside Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or
the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Parent shall determine
the strategy to be pursued for obtaining and lead the effort to obtain all
Governmental Approvals for the Transactions under the HSR Act or any other
Regulatory Laws and the Company shall take all reasonable actions to support
Parent in connection therewith.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(b), Parent and the Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing on or before the End Date, including defending
(with sufficient time for resolution in advance of the End Date) through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court with respect to the
Transactions by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental
Authority or any private party; and (ii) avoid or eliminate impediments under
any Regulatory Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible
(and in any event no later than the End Date), including (A) agreeing to the
sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines, assets,
contractual rights, or relationships of Parent, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries or (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions
that after the Closing may limit Parent's or its Subsidiaries' (including the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) freedom of action with respect to, or
its or their ability to operate or retain, one or more of the businesses,
product lines or assets of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to oppose by refusing to
consent to, through litigation or otherwise any request, attempt or demand by
any Governmental Authority or other Person for any divestiture, hold separate
condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets, businesses or
product lines of either Parent or the Company. Parent shall have the
obligation to defend litigation instituted by such Governmental Authority or
other Person with respect to the legality of the Transactions under the HSR
Act or any other Regulatory Laws and shall take any and all steps necessary to
promptly vacate, reverse or overturn any adverse decree judgment, permanent
injunction or other Order, including agreeing to take any of the actions set
forth in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) in this Section 6.5(c).

(d) The Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt written notice to the Company, of: (i) the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur has resulted in or
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure to satisfy or be able to
satisfy any of the conditions specified in Article VII, and such written
notice shall specify the condition which has failed or will fail to be
satisfied; (ii) any written notice from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions to
the extent such consent is material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (iii) any material written notice from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions; provided that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5(d) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent or the Company.

(e) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts, with the cooperation of and
in consultation with the Company, to obtain within sixty (60) days of from the
date hereof: (i) written confirmation from the United States Forest Service
that renewal, issuance or reissuance of the USFS Permits is not required as a
consequence of consummation of the Merger, or (ii) renewed, reissued, or new
USFS



Permits on United States Forest Service form ski area special use permit FS

(f) The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and will cause
each Company Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain
waivers or consents (as applicable) from the applicable third parties with
respect to each Contract listed on Section 4.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; provided that, in connection with obtaining any such waivers or
consents (as applicable), the Company will not agree to any change to any such
Contract that would be materially adverse to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or, after the Merger, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.6 Access and Reports.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and applicable contractual restrictions in
effect on the date hereof, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers and other
authorized Representatives of Parent, reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its and
the Company Subsidiaries' officers and its and the Company Subsidiaries'
properties, offices and other facilities and its and the Company Subsidiaries'
books, contracts, personnel files and records, and, during such period, the
Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly
all information concerning its and the Company Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent and its
Representatives from time to time; provided that any such access shall be
coordinated through one of the persons listed on Section 6.6 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and provided, further, that no investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein; and provided, further, that the foregoing
shall not require the Company to (i) (A) permit any inspection that, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, would be materially disruptive to the
business or operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or
(B) disclose any information that would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or
violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality, (ii) disclose
any information that would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, be
prohibited by applicable Law or be reasonably likely to result in the waiver
of the protection of attorney‑client, work product or other legal privilege or
(iii) prior to the Effective Time and except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or legal process, provide access to or otherwise make available
any information relating to the process conducted by the Company that led to

hereunder.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of any (i) notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent and (ii) action, suit, claim, investigation or
proceeding commenced or, to such party's knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions.

Section 6.7 Public Announcements. Except with respect to any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Alternative
Proposal, Superior Proposal or related matters in accordance with Section 6.4
(in which case, the Company shall provide Parent notice of any such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or announcement in accordance with



Section 6.4(d)) or any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions, Parent and the Company shall provide an opportunity for the
other party to review and comment upon any press release or other public

not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
providing such opportunity to review and comment, except as such party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system. The Company and Parent agree
that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions
shall be in a form mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. Nothing in
this Section 6.7 shall limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are consistent in all
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the
Transactions.

Section 6.10 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the present and former officers and directors of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and any person who becomes an officer or
director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time
(each, an "Indemnified Person"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and any fees, costs and expenses
(including the reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements of
counsel of the respective Indemnified Party\'s choosing) incurred or arising
in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such
Indemnified Party's service as an officer, employee or director at or prior to
the Effective Time, or services performed by such Indemnified Party, at the
request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, as a fiduciary under any
Company Benefit Plan, in each case to the extent they arise out of (i) matters
existing or occurring or alleged to have existed or occurred at or prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) matters related to this Agreement and the
Transactions and (iii) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. In the event of
any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (A) each Indemnified Person will
be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such
claim, action, suit or proceeding within ten Business Days of receipt by the
Surviving Corporation from such Indemnified Person of a request therefor,
provided that the Indemnified Person provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is determined by a final determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal) that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law and
(B) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use their respective best
efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less



advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws as of the date of this
Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall obtain, and fully
pay the premium for, a non-cancelable extension of the Company\'s directors'
and officers' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies
(collectively, the "DandO Insurance") in place as of the date hereof, in each
case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time and on terms and conditions and with retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as those
contained in the Company's DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date
hereof; provided that if the aggregate cost for such insurance coverage in
respect of any one policy year exceeds 300% of the current annual premium paid
by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall instead be obligated to obtain DandO
Insurance with the best available coverage with respect to matters occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate cost in respect of each
policy year within such six-year period of 300% of the current annual premium
paid by the Company.

(d) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
Transactions) now existing in favor of any Indemnified Person as provided in
any agreement in effect on the date hereof (and made available to Parent prior
to the date hereof) between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any Indemnified Person, on the other hand, will be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation without further action, as of the Effective Time, and
will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

(f) The rights of Indemnified Parties to indemnification and insurance
pursuant to this Section 6.10 are expressly intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his
or her legal representatives and are a contract right of each Indemnified
Party as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and those rights to
indemnification and insurance shall exist in addition to and without limiting
any and all rights to indemnification granted or arising under the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or the Surviving Corporation's articles of
incorporation or bylaws, or by operation of law. The provisions of this
Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that any
claim for indemnification is asserted or made on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification in respect of
such claim shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

Section 6.11 Employee Matters.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is 12 months after the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries) to, provide each Employee who
is employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date
(each, a "Company Employee") to the extent that the Company Employee remains
employed by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, that is at least equal to the base salary or hourly wage rate
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; (ii)
incentive compensation opportunities (including bonus, commission and other



incentive compensation opportunities) that are at least equal to the incentive
compensation opportunities in effect for such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date (it being understood that Parent will make, or cause
one of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries) to make, the applicable payment
in respect of such incentive compensation opportunities that are earned or
accrued in the 12-month period after the Closing Date at the time(s) they
would be payable in the ordinary course even if such payment date is after the
conclusion of such 12-month period); and (iii) employee benefits that are (x)
not less favorable than the employee benefits provided to such Company
Employee under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date
(or, if a Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, then with respect to such plan,
immediately prior to its termination) or (y) on the same terms and conditions
as offered to similarly situated employees of Parent (or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates).

(b) Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries) shall treat, and shall cause
each plan, program, policy, practice and arrangement sponsored or maintained
by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries) on or after the Closing
Date and in which any Company Employee (or the spouse, domestic partner or
dependent of any Company Employee) participates or is eligible to participate
(each, a "Parent Plan") to treat, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and,
solely for the purposes of determining the amount of vacation, sick leave and
other paid time off, benefit accrual and level of benefits, all service with
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (and any predecessor employers if the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Benefit Plan provides past
service credit) prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates; provided, however, that such service need not be
counted to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits and such
service need only be credited to the same extent and for the same purpose as
such service was credited under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

(c) Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Parent Plan that is a welfare
benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, to waive any and
all eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements, evidence of
insurability requirements, pre-existing condition limitations and other
exclusions and limitations regarding the Company Employees and their spouses,
domestic partners and dependents to the extent waived, satisfied or not
imposed under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan.

(d) If requested by Parent at least five days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall adopt resolutions terminating any and all Company Benefit Plans
described in Section 401(k) of the Code (each, a "Company 401(k) Plan"),
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. If the
Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan pursuant to this
Section 6.11(d), then as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (and in
any event not later than 45 days thereafter), Parent will establish or
designate, or will cause the Surviving Corporation or one of Parent's other
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to establish or designate, a defined contribution
plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement and that satisfies the
requirement of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code (the "Parent 401(k)
Plan"). Each Company Employee who was eligible to participate in such
terminated Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the termination of such
plan shall become eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date (and in any event not later than 45 days
thereafter). Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept "direct
rollovers" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of "eligible
rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code)
from such Company 401(k) Plan to (or on behalf of) Company Employees who
remain employed by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates at the time of such rollover, including
the amount



of any unpaid balance of any participant loan made under such Company 401(k)
Plan (and the related promissory note), to the extent such rollovers are
elected by such Company Employees.

(e) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, or any similar
foreign, provincial, state or local Law, with respect to "employment losses"
which would constitute a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (each as defined in
such Act) occurring at or after the Effective Time.

(f) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in any Company
Employee or any other Employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
continued employment by or service with Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or prevent
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Company
Employee or any other Employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to continue any particular
Company Benefit Plans or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof after the Closing Date (subject to the other provisions of this
Section 6.11); or (iii) be treated as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan
or any other employee benefit plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement
of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

Section 6.12 Transaction Litigation. Subject to entry into a customary joint
defense agreement, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult
with the Company and participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their
respective directors or officers (each, a "Company Party") relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions. None of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company shall compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such shareholder litigation, in
each case unless Parent shall have consented in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided that the
Company may compromise, settle or come to an agreement regarding shareholder
litigation made or pending against a Company Party, if each of the following
conditions are met: (i) the resolution of all such litigation requires payment
from the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or Representatives in an
amount not to exceed the amount set forth in Section 6.12 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the provision of disclosures to the shareholders of the
Company relating to the Merger (provided that Parent shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any supplemental disclosure and the
Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable changes thereto proposed
by Parent); (ii) the settlement provides for no injunctive or similar relief
prohibiting or mandating certain action by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
Guarantor, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates,
Subsidiaries or Representatives; (iii) the settlement provides that Parent and
its Subsidiaries and Representatives are released from all liability in
connection therewith with prejudice; (iv) none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, and their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives are required to
admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, and (v) the withdrawal or
dismissal (with prejudice) of all shareholder claims and actions then pending
relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions.

Section 6.13 Rule 16b-3 Approval. Prior to the Closing, the Company and the
Company Board or a committee thereof, shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take all actions to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act any disposition of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who
is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



Section 6.14 Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation. Parent
shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

Section 6.15 No Control of Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision
over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

(a) if the Merger has not been consummated on or before January 21, 2020 (the

enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced, or entered any Law or Order making
illegal, permanently enjoining, or otherwise permanently prohibiting the

for adoption at a duly convened Company Shareholders Meeting and the Company
Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at such meeting (unless such

representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation hereunder, which breach has
not been cured.

Section 8.4 Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be terminated by Parent
(with any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger
Sub):

(a) If a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or the
Company shall have breached its obligations set forth in Section 6.4 in any
material respect; or

(b) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
such that the conditions to the Closing of the Merger set forth in Section
7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), as applicable, would not be satisfied and, in either
such case, such breach is incapable of being cured by the End Date; provided
that Parent shall have given the Company at least 30 days written notice prior
to such termination stating Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.4(b); provided further, that Parent shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.4(b) if
Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation hereunder, which breach has not been cured.

Section 8.5 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.2,
Section 8.3 or Section 8.4, the terminating party shall deliver written notice
thereof to the other party or parties (as applicable), specifying with
particularity the reason for such termination and the provision hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made, and any such termination in
accordance with this Section 8.5 shall be effective immediately upon delivery
of such written notice to such other party or parties.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article VIII, it will
become void and of no further force and effect, with no liability on the part
of any party to this Agreement (or any shareholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, or Representative of such party) to any other party hereto,
except: (a) with respect to Section 4.24, Section 5.9, this Section 8.5,
Section 8.6 and Article IX (and any related definitions contained in any such
Sections or Article), which shall remain in full force and effect; and (b)
with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party, to
the extent such liabilities or damages were the result of fraud or the willful
and material breach by another party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, or other agreements set forth in this Agreement.

Section 8.6 Termination Fee.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a), then
the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds), within five Business Days after such termination, a fee in an amount

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a),
then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds), prior to or simultaneously with such termination, the
Termination Fee.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.2(c), then the Company shall pay to or as directed by Parent all of
the fees and expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, and investment bankers) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions in an amount not to exceed
$3,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Parent Expenses"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement.

(d) If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(c), (ii) after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement an Alternative Proposal
shall have been publicly made, commenced, submitted or announced or made known
to the Company Board prior to this Agreement's termination and (iii) the
Company consummates a transaction with respect to such Alternative Proposal
within 12 months after such termination, or signs a definitive agreement with
respect to such Alternative Proposal within 12 months after such termination
and such transaction is subsequently consummated, then the Company shall pay
to Parent, within two Business Days following such consummation, the
Termination Fee (less the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to
Parent pursuant to Section 8.6(c), if any); provided that, solely for purposes
of this Section 8.6(d), all references to "fifteen percent (15%)" and "eighty-
five percent (85%)" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed
to be references to "fifty percent (50%)."

obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties
hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Parent Expenses or Termination
Fee becomes payable and are paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.6,
the Parent Expenses and Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be Parent's
and Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this
Agreement.

Section 9.3 Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors. Except for
the provisions of Section 6.10 and this Section 9.3, this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and respective
successors and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit,
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than (i) the right of the shareholders of the Company to receive the aggregate
Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim that may not be made unless

parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.4 without notice or liability
to any Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation



among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 9.4 Extension; Waivers. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
party may, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
or parties hereto (as applicable), (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made by any other party hereto contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of any other party hereto
contained herein; provided that any agreement by a party to any such waiver or
extension shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing duly
executed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Subject to
the foregoing, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, or delay or omission in the
exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a result of
any breach or default hereunder by any other party shall be deemed to impair
any such right power or remedy, nor will it be deemed to constitute a waiver
by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any
party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

Section 9.5 Amendments. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by their boards of directors, at any time prior
to the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Company Shareholder
Approval, no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the Company
shareholders may be made without such approval having been obtained. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing duly executed
by each of the parties hereto.

Section 9.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties and supersede all
other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among or
between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof. Each exhibit and schedule to this Agreement will be considered
incorporated into this Agreement.

Section 9.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto
in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall
be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and
the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof
each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the parties
hereto.

Section 9.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement, to the extent possible, in such a manner as to be
valid, legal and enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of the
parties as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement, and all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not
affected in any manner adverse to any party.



Section 9.9 Governing Law. This Agreement and any controversy related to or
arising, directly or indirectly, out of, caused by or resulting from this
Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic
Laws of the State of Missouri, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of Missouri or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Missouri.

Section 9.10 Enforcement of Agreement.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
any of the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to
consummate the Merger and the Transactions) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and hereby agree that, unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with Article VIII, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement.

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not raise any objection to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided herein, including objections on the basis that
(i) either party has an adequate remedy at law or equity or (ii) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such Order or injunction. The remedies available each of
the parties pursuant to this Section 9.10 shall be in addition to any other
remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue
an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit any of the parties from, in the alternative, seeking to terminate this
Agreement and collect the Parent Expenses and the Termination Fee, if
applicable, pursuant to Section 8.6. The parties hereto further agree that
nothing set forth in this Section 9.10 shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for specific performance under this Section 9.10
prior to or as a condition to exercising any termination right under Article
VIII (or receipt of any amounts due pursuant to Section 8.6), nor shall the
commencement of any legal action or legal proceeding pursuant to this Section
9.12 or anything set forth in this Section 9.10 restrict or limit any party's
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Article
VIII.

Section 9.11 Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property,
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of Missouri
located in St. Louis County, Missouri, or the Federal court of the United
States of America located in the Eastern District of Missouri, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection
herewith or any of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (b) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Missouri state court or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, in such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it
may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
Missouri state or Federal court, and (d) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by



applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in any such Missouri state or Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Each
party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the
manner provided for notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

Section 9.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREFOR.

Section 9.13 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon or under this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be made
against the parties hereto, and no Person who is not a party to this
Agreement, including any director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, shareholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of
any party to this Agreement that is not itself a party to this Agreement,
shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to
this Agreement or for any claim against the parties to this Agreement (whether
in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
Transactions or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith.

Section 9.14 Guarantor. Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company, as the primary obligor and not merely as surety,
the due and punctual observance, payment, performance and discharge of the
obligations of Parent pursuant to this Agreement (the "Obligations"). If
Parent fails to pay or perform the Obligations when due, then all of
Guarantor's liabilities to the Company hereunder in respect of such
Obligations shall, at the Company\'s option, become immediately due and
payable and the Company may at any time and from time to time take any and all
actions available hereunder or under applicable law to enforce and collect the
Obligations from Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, Guarantor
acknowledges that the Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute
a separate action or actions against Guarantor for the full amount of the
Obligations, regardless of whether any action is brought against Parent.
Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
