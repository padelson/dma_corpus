Common Stock to which the Minority Shareholders become entitled pursuant to
the Second Step Distribution (together with any dividends or distributions

Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.13(f)_.  

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of

---|---|--- 
 



48

         | (e) |

None of Parent, the Company, Buyer or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund (including for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.13_, any shares in Parent Common Stock

_Section_ __ _ 2.13(f)_ and any cash received from the sale of shares in
Parent Common Stock as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.13(f)_) or the Offer
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Offer Consideration or the
cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article 2_ remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares, with respect to Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, as of the second (2nd) anniversary
of the Acceptance Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Offer Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority), shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

In the event that the Post-Offer Reorganization is effectuated and the Second
Step Distribution is implemented, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly
advise, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.07_, the Exchange Agent in
writing of (i) the number of shares in Parent Common Stock to which the
Minority Shareholders of the Company (or, if the Legal Merger is effectuated,
the Allotting Entity) become entitled pursuant to the Second Step Distribution
(prior to giving effect to any Tax withholding) and (ii) the amount of Dutch
dividend withholding Tax in respect of the Second Step Distribution that is
required to be withheld and remitted to the competent Tax authority in Euros
(the aggregate amount of such Dutch dividend withholding Tax in Euros, the "
_Aggregate Withholding Amount_ "). The Exchange Agent shall be authorized,
acting as agent of the Company (or, if the Legal Merger is effectuated, the
Allotting Entity) as withholding agent ( _inhoudingsplichtige_ ) and for the
account of the Minority Shareholders as taxpayers of the applicable Dutch
dividend withholding Tax, to sell, in one or more transactions such number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the shareholders would otherwise be
entitled as is necessary to obtain in Dollars an amount in net cash proceeds
that converted in Euros is as close as possible to, but no less than, the
Aggregate Withholding Amount (the " _Parent Common Stock Sale_ ). From the net
cash proceeds obtained pursuant to the Parent Common Stock Sale the Exchange
Agent shall, as soon as possible, remit to the competent Tax authority the
Aggregate Withholding Amount as agent of the Company (or, if the Legal Merger
is effectuated, the Allotting Entity), as withholding agent (
_inhoudingsplichtige_ ) or transfer to the Company (or, if the Legal Merger
is effectuated, the Allotting Entity) the Aggregate Withholding Amount to
enable the Company (or, if the Legal Merger is effectuated, the Allotting
Entity) as withholding agent ( _inhoudingsplichtige_ ) to remit the Aggregate
Withholding Amount to the competent Tax authority. In the event that the net
cash proceeds obtained by the Exchange Agent pursuant to the Parent Common
Stock Sale exceed the Aggregate Withholding Amount, such surplus cash
proceeds shall be paid to the Minority Shareholders consistent 

---|---|--- 
 



49

         |  with the procedures for payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares; provided that the Buyer shall be entitled to any surplus if the amount
thereof is de minimis. The Exchange Agent shall be instructed and authorized
to sell, in one or more transactions, an additional number of shares of Parent
Common Stock on behalf of and for the benefit of Minority Shareholders to the
extent necessary to make payments to each individual Minority Shareholder in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such Minority
Shareholders would otherwise be entitled to receive after withholding of
applicable Taxes (including Dutch dividend withholding Tax), including through
the Parent Common Stock Sale, whereby the net cash proceeds of such
additional share sales shall determine the compensation for the relevant
fractions of shares of Parent Common Stock. As a result the Exchange Agent
shall (x) (A) in case neither the Conversion nor the Post-Merger Share Sale
has been effectuated, deliver to each Minority Shareholder a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to (a) the product of (i) the Offer Consideration
and (ii) the number of Shares held by such Minority Shareholder immediately
before the Second Step Distribution _minus_ (b) the number of Parent Common
Stock sold by the Exchange Agent to satisfy the payment of the individual
Dutch dividend withholding Tax liability  _minus_ (c) the number of Parent
Common Stock sold by the Exchange Agent to make a cash compensation to such
Minority Shareholder in lieu of its individual fractional shares (if any) in
accordance with the previous sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.13(f)_, (B)
in case the Conversion has been effectuated, deliver to each Minority
Shareholder a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (a) the product
of (i) the Offer Consideration and (ii) one-fifth (1/5th) of the number of
Post-Conversion Shares held by such Minority Shareholder immediately before
the Second Step Distribution minus (b) the number of Parent Common Stock sold
by the Exchange Agent to satisfy the payment of the individual Dutch dividend
withholding Tax liability of such Minority Shareholder _minus_ (c) the number
of Parent Common Stock sold by the Exchange Agent to make a cash compensation
to such Minority Shareholder in lieu of its individual fractional shares (if
any) in accordance with the previous sentence of this _Section_ __ _
2.13(f)_, or (C) in case the Post-Merger Share Sale has been effectuated,
deliver to each Minority Shareholder a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to (a) the product of (i) the Offer Consideration and (ii) one-
fifth (1/5th) of the number of shares in the capital of the Allotting Entity
held by such Minority Shareholder immediately before the Second Step
Distribution _minus_ (b) the number of Parent Common Stock sold by the
Exchange Agent to satisfy the payment of the individual Dutch
dividend withholding Tax liability of such Minority Shareholder _minus_ (c)
the number of Parent Common Stock sold by the Exchange Agent to make a cash
compensation to such Minority Shareholder in lieu of its individual fractional
shares (if any) in accordance with the previous sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 2.13(f)_ and (y) transfer to such Minority Shareholder the cash
compensation to which such Minority  
---|--- 
 



50

         |  Shareholder is entitled under (c) above. Banks and other
financial institutions may charge administrative costs to Minority
Shareholders in relation to the transfer of the Second Step Distribution to
their accounts, for which no compensation will be paid to such Minority
Shareholders. For the avoidance of doubt, no Minority Shareholder shall have a
further right to Parent Common Stock, cash compensation or any other
consideration in respect of the Second Step Distribution other than the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash compensation in lieu of
its fractional shares (if any) in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
2.13(f)_.  
---|--- 

_Section_ __ _ 2.14_ _No Fractional Shares_. In lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable pursuant to the
Offer, each holder of Shares who otherwise would be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Offer (after
aggregating all Shares tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by
such holder) shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent
Trading Price, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent (the "
_Fractional Share Cash Amount_ ").

_Section_ __ _ 5.02_ _Access to_ _Information_.

 



     | (a) |

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to,
afford Parent, Buyer and their Representatives reasonable access on reasonable
advance notice and in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operations
of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, during normal business
hours, to the officers, senior employees, Representatives, auditors,
properties, offices and other facilities and the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent, Buyer and their
Representatives copies (including in electronic form) of books, records
and other financial, operating and other data and information as Parent,
Buyer or their Representatives may reasonably request (including to facilitate
Parents review of REIT compliance matters) in writing addressed to David
Ruberg;  _provided_ , that such access shall not permit Parent, Buyer and
their Representatives to conduct any intrusive soil and groundwater
investigation at any of the properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any information (i) if
providing such access or disclosing such information would or would be
reasonably likely to cause material competitive harm to the Company or its
Subsidiaries if the Transactions are not consummated, (ii) if providing such
access or disclosing such information would reasonably be expected to, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company after receiving advice from counsel,
violate any applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy Laws) or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, or (iii) that,
would reasonably be expected to, in the reasonable judgment of the Company
after receiving advice from counsel, result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege with respect to such information or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a waiver of any other privilege or Trade Secret protection held by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts (A) to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or waiver
of any other privilege or Trade Secret protection or violation of any such
applicable Law or binding agreement or (B) to develop an alternative to
providing such information so as to address such matters that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent, Buyer and the Company. The Company shall advise Parent
and Buyer in such circumstances that it is unable to comply with Parent or
Buyers reasonable requests for information pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, and the Company shall reasonably describe the reasons why
such information is being withheld. The Company shall be entitled to have 

---|---|--- 
 



103

         |  Representatives present at all times during any inspection by
Parent or Buyer or their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 5.02(a)_. No notice, access, review or investigation pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or information provided, made available or delivered to
Parent or Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or otherwise shall
affect any representations or warranties of the Company or conditions or
rights of Parent and Buyer contained in this Agreement. No investigation after

20, 2016, by and between the Company and Parent (the " _Clean Team Agreement_

Confidentiality Agreement or the Clean Team Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean Team Agreement shall be deemed
terminated as of the Closing.

directly or indirectly, rights to control the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the Closing.

(i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person or group making such Alternative Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that (A) prior to furnishing any such non-public
information, it receives from such Person or group an

provision or other term that would restrict, in any manner, the Companys
ability to consummate the Transactions or to comply with its disclosure
obligations to Parent or Buyer pursuant to this Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B) promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) after furnishing any such non-public information to
such Person or group, it furnishes such non-public information to Parent or
Buyer to the extent Parent or Buyer has not previously been provided with such
information; and

by Parent and Buyer, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent during

amended); and

(iii) no earlier than the end of the four (4) and three (3) Business Day
period, as applicable, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised

Adverse Recommendation Change and the Company Board shall have determined, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, that the failure to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under the Laws of the Netherlands and (B) prior to making such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent requested in writing by
Parent and Buyer, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent during such
four (4) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
failure of the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to the Company Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii)
below would no longer be, in the good faith determination of the Company
Board, inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under the Laws
of the Netherlands; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that in light of such Company Intervening Event and taking into account any
revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under the Laws of the Netherlands (it being understood and
agreed that any material change to the circumstances giving rise to the
Company Intervening Event that was previously the subject of a notice
hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above; _provided_ ,
that, with respect to each such material change, each reference in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) to a "four (4) Business Day" period shall be
changed to refer to a "three (3) Business Day" period).

 _Section_ __ _ 5.07_ _Tax_.



     | (a) |

As soon as possible after the date of this Agreement, the Company will, at the
reasonable instruction of the Buyer, seek advance Tax clearances on (i) the
amount of recognized paid-up share capital and share premium per share (
_fiscaal erkend kapitaal_ ) for Dutch dividend withholding Tax purposes
pursuant to article 13 of the Dutch Dividend Withholding Tax Act ( _Wet op de
dividendbelasting 1965_ ), (ii) other relevant Dutch dividend withholding Tax
aspects and (iii) other Tax aspects of the Transactions, in each case to the
extent this is reasonably necessary to effectuate the Transactions in a Tax
efficient manner or to facilitate compliance with relevant Tax laws including
determining the amounts of Dutch dividend withholding Tax to be withheld in
respect of the Second Step Distribution. Buyer shall prepare the drafts of
the Tax clearances in relation to the Transactions, submit such drafts to the
Company as soon as reasonably 

---|---|--- 
 



109

         |  possible for its review and provide the Company an opportunity
to consult and comment on such draft Tax clearances and the Parties agree to
include all comments reasonably and timely proposed by the Company and its
counsel before the intended submission to the relevant Taxing Authority. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide any information and documentation
reasonably requested by Buyer for purposes of preparing these drafts.
The Company or the Buyer, as appropriate, will submit the Tax clearances to
the relevant Taxing Authority as soon as reasonably possible following the
final version having been determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.07_,  _provided_ that no Tax clearance shall be submitted to, or agreed
with, the relevant Taxing Authority by a Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.07_, any
reference to "Tax clearances" shall be deemed to include any material
correspondence or other documents to be sent to the relevant Taxing Authority. 
---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of

its absolute and/or relative direct or indirect investments in Dutch real
estate by its direct Subsidiaries for purposes of Article 4 of the Dutch
Legal Transfer Tax Act ( _Wet Op belastingen van rechtsverkeer 1970_ ) which
increase in itself would result in the Company or any of its direct
Subsidiaries becoming a real estate investment company within the meaning of
Article 4 of the Dutch Legal Transfer Tax Act ( _Wet Op belastingen van
rechtsverkeer 1970_ ). The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, provide Parent, Buyer and their respective Representatives
all information reasonably required to determine whether the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries qualifies as a real estate investment company, but only to
the extent such information is reasonably available to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

filing of the Legal Merger Proposal or the Legal Demerger Proposal, as the
case may be, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ or _Section_ __ _

receipt of written notice of any actual, pending or threatened opposition
rights proceeding initiated, pending to be initiated or threatened to be
initiated by any Company Creditor pursuant to Dutch Law (whether during the
aforementioned one-month period or otherwise). Such notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of such opposition rights proceeding. With
respect to any such opposition rights proceeding, _Section_ __ _ 7.06_ shall
apply.

ARTICLE 6

 

 _COVENANTS OF PARENT AND BUYER_

 

Parent and Buyer jointly and severally agree that:

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ _Director and Offic_ _er Liability_.

 



     | (a) |

For six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified
Person_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
consummation of the Post-Offer Reorganization and in connection with the
Transactions to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. In the event
that any Indemnified Person is made party to any Action that would be
indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall
cause the Company to advance fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with and prior to the final disposition of such Action, subject to
the execution by such Indemnified Person of appropriate undertakings to repay
such advanced fees, costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification, in each case
except to the extent prohibited under applicable Law. For a period of six (6)
years following the Closing, Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements in
effect as of the date hereof between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any Indemnified Person (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ "). In
addition, for a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Parent shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to cause the articles of association
and rules and regulations of the Company Board (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to exculpation of Liability of all
Indemnified Persons, indemnification of all Indemnified Persons and
advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous in the
aggregate to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
contained in the Company Organizational Documents as of the date hereof. To
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, such indemnification and
exculpation shall be mandatory rather than permissive.  

---|---|--- 
 



111

         | (b) |

Parent shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, effective as of the Closing, a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years after the
Closing with respect to directors and officers Liability insurance covering
each Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
Liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing on terms that are no less favorable than those of such policy of the
Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior
to the Closing, be in effect and prepaid for such six (6)-year period;
provided, however, that, in no event shall the total cost for such prepaid
"tail" insurance policy exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the date
hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and if the
total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then Parent
may obtain, or cause to be obtained, a prepaid "tail" policy with the maximum
coverage available for a total cost of the Premium Cap. Upon execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall execute transaction-specific "Broker of
Record" letters to appoint Parents insurance brokers as the Companys
authorized representative solely for the purpose of negotiation such tail
coverage with the Companys incumbent insurers; provided, that such
appointments shall be rescinded if the Transactions are not completed. If
Parent for any reason fails to obtain, or cause to be obtained, such "tail"
insurance policy as of the Closing, Parent shall continue, or cause to be
continued, to maintain in effect, for a period of six (6) years from and after
the Closing, the directors and officers Liability insurance in place as of
the date of this Agreement or a comparable policy with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current directors and officers Liability insurance
carrier on terms no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | (c) |

If Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with, or merge with or into, any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, in each case, Parent or Buyer, as applicable,
shall take such action as may be necessary so that such Person shall assume
all of the applicable obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) |

Each Indemnified Person is intended to be a Third Party beneficiary of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_, with full rights of enforcement as if such Indemnified
Person was a party hereto. The rights of any Indemnified Person under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of,
any other rights that such Persons may have under the Company Organizational
Documents, the Indemnification Agreements or applicable Law (whether at Law or
in equity).

as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the application accepted by the NYSE as
promptly as is practicable following its submission.

_Section_ __ _ 6.03_ _Rule  16b-3_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent,
the Parent Board and the compensation committee of the Parent Board shall take
such steps as may be reasonably required or advisable to cause acquisition
of Parent Securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
and who may become a director or officer of Parent to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 under the 1934 Act.

than the base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

Closing (subject to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 6.04(g)_), (ii) health and
welfare benefits and other broad-based employee benefits provided under the
Company Plans listed in _Section_ __ _ 3.18(b)_ of the Company Letter or
required to be provided to the applicable Continuing Employee under applicable

clause (iii) and defined benefit retirement benefits) that are no less

other broad-based employee benefits provided under the Company Plans listed
in _Section_ __ _ 3.18(b)_ of the Company Letter or required to be provided

after the Closing for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to the same extent that such service was credited for
purposes of any comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Closing,
except, in each case, to the extent such treatment would result

such limitations are not permitted by applicable Law. In addition, to the

during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to be credited for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her

Plan (to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable Company
Plans prior to the Closing).

appropriate to reflect the occurrence of the Transactions, subject to each
such Continuing Employees continued employment with Parent or an
Affiliate thereof through December 31 of the year in which the Closing occurs

as Parent may determine, but in no event later than March 15 of the year
following the year in which the Closing occurs; _provided_ , _however_ , that,

shall, if requested by Parent or an Affiliate thereof, be subject to the
applicable Continuing Employees execution and non-revocation of a general
release of claims in a form customarily used by Parent and its Affiliates
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include the Company and its
Subsidiaries) for its similarly situated employees.

qualification as a REIT under the Code for any period or portion thereof
ending on or prior to the Closing or to avoid incurring entity level income
or excise Taxes under the Code, including making dividend or other
distribution payments to stockholders of Parent in accordance with this
Agreement or otherwise. If Parent determines that it is necessary to take any
such action, it shall notify the Company as soon as reasonably practicable and

_Section_ __ _ 6.06_ _Access to_ _Information_.

 



     | (a) |

During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, and Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, afford the
Company and its Representatives reasonable access on reasonable advance notice
and in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the operations of the business
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, during normal business hours, to the officers,
senior employees, Representatives, auditors, properties, offices and other
facilities and the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Company and its Representatives copies (including in electronic form)
of books, records and other financial, operating and other data and
information as the Company may reasonably request in writing addressed to Greg
Wright, Joshua Mills or any other person designated in writing by Greg Wright
or Joshua Mills; _provided_ , that such access shall not permit the Company
and its Representatives to conduct any intrusive soil and groundwater
investigation at any of the properties, offices and other facilities of Parent
and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any information (i) if
providing such access or disclosing such information would or would reasonably
be expected to cause material competitive harm to Parent or Buyer if the
Transactions are not consummated, (ii) if providing such access or disclosing
such information would reasonably be expected to, in the reasonable judgment
of Parent after receiving advice from counsel violate any applicable Law
(including antitrust and privacy Laws) or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or (iii) that, would reasonably be
expected to in the reasonable judgment of Parent, result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege with respect to such information or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a waiver of any other privilege or Trade
Secret protection held by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (A) to allow for such
access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege or waiver of any other privilege or Trade Secret protection
or violation of any such applicable Law or binding agreement or (B) to develop
an alternative to providing such information so as to address such matters
that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Parent shall advise
the Company in such circumstances that it is unable to comply with the
Companys reasonable requests for information pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, and Parent shall reasonably describe the reasons why such
information is being withheld. Parent shall be entitled to have
Representatives present at all times during any inspection by the Company or
their Representatives pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_. No notice,
access, review or investigation 

---|---|--- 
 



118

_Section_ __ _ 6.07_ _Parent_ _Adverse Recommendation Change_.



     | (a) |

Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.07(b)_, neither the Parent Board nor
any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, withhold, withdraw,
qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to
the Company, the Parent Recommendation or fail to make, or include in the
applicable Parent Disclosure Documents, the Parent Recommendation, or make any

Recommendation Change_ "). 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.07(a)_, upon the occurrence of any Parent Intervening Event, the Parent
Board may, at any time prior to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval,
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, or authorize, resolve, agree or

conditions are met: 

---|---|--- 

(i) Parent shall have (A) provided to the Company four (4) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Parent Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to
clause (ii) below, the Parent Board has determined to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change and the Parent Board shall have determined, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that the failure to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the Parent directors duties under the Laws of the
State of Maryland and (B) prior to making such a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, to the extent requested in writing by the
Company, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Company during such four
(4) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the
failure of the Parent Board to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to the Parent Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii) below
would no longer be, in the good faith determination of the Parent Board,
inconsistent with the directors duties under the Laws of the State of
Maryland; and

 



119

    

(ii) the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that in light of such
Parent Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms proposed by
the Company, the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with the Parent directors duties under the Laws of the State
of Maryland (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the
circumstances giving rise to the Parent Intervening Event that was previously
the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a new notice to the Company
as provided above; _provided_ , that, with respect to each such material
change, each reference in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) to a "four (4)
Business Day" period shall be changed to refer to a "three (3) Business Day"
period).



     | (c) |

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board
from taking and disclosing to the Parents shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act
(or any similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making
or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer); _provided_ that any such
disclosure shall be deemed a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Parent Board expressly publicly reaffirms and without qualification (other
than a recitation of the terms of this Agreement) the Parent Recommendation.

Action brought by a Governmental Authority, or brought by a Third Party before

best efforts to (i) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, or Action, (ii) promptly inform the other Parties of
any communication (excluding non-material communications) to or from the

meetings or teleconferences (excluding non-material teleconferences) with any
Governmental Authority in connection with any such request, inquiry or Action

relating to Parent, Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates that appear in any application or filing made with, or
written materials submitted to (in each case, including any amendments
thereto), any Third Party or any Governmental Authority in

         |  connection with the Transactions or filings to be made under
applicable Antitrust Laws (and any amendments thereto), and shall consider in
good faith comments proposed by Buyer or the Company, as the case may be;
_provided_ , that with respect to any documents or materials required to be
filed under applicable Antitrust Laws that contain information (i) that is
commercially sensitive or (ii) the provision of which would infringe
Antitrust Laws, such information may be provided solely to those individuals
acting as outside legal counsel for the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_
, that such information may be redacted as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns;
_provided_ _further_ , that such counsel shall not disclose such information
to such other Parties.

Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order resulting
therefrom, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions. 

---|---|--- 



     | (g) |

Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to, promptly, and in any event prior to the

the consummation of the Transactions under the Required Approvals or under
any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (y) resolve any objections asserted
with respect to the Transactions under applicable Law raised by any
Governmental Authority, in each case, to the extent necessary in order to
prevent the entry of any Legal Restraint that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be obligated to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not agree to (other than at the written request of Parent,
in which case the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, provided the
effectiveness of any such action is conditioned on the Closing), (i) proffer
to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or

transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the capital stock of the Company or (iii) agree to other
structural, behavioral or conduct relief with respect to the behavior of
Parent, Buyer or the Company and any of their Subsidiaries (each of the
actions described in the preceding _claus_ _es (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , a "
_Remedy Action_ "), except that, (A) in the case of a Remedy Action under
clause _(i)_ of the definition thereof, to the extent necessary in order to
avoid or lift a Legal Restraint sought by any Governmental Authority that
would prevent the Closing, Parent will agree to do the following and no more
than the following: Parent shall offer and continue to offer to agree to
divest, hold separate, or otherwise dispose of one or more of its or its
Subsidiaries properties or one or more of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
properties, up to but not exceeding, in the aggregate, 35 megawatts of IT Load
capacity, and (B) in the case of a Remedy Action under clauses _(ii)_ or
_(iii)_ of the definition thereof, Parent will undertake Remedy Actions that

benefits that Parent reasonably expects to derive from the Transactions.

     | (h) |

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall have principal responsibility for determining the timing and
sequence of seeking the required authorizations, consents, Orders and
approvals under the applicable Antitrust Laws and any other Laws and from any
Governmental Authorities and strategy with respect to obtaining any such
authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals; _provided_ , that nothing in
this Section 7.01(h) shall relieve Parent of the obligations set forth in

best efforts to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as
practicable. 

---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

135

         |  Company or Parent, as the case may be, on a fixed basis and,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.12_, and except with respect to claims for
Willful Breach, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, for losses, damages,
costs and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with the termination of
this Agreement. If one Party to this Agreement (the " _Termination Payor_ ")

8.03(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.03(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.03(d)_ (such payment,

---|--- 



     | (f) |

Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, the Termination Payment shall be
exclusive of any VAT, if applicable. Buyer, Parent and the Company shall take
the position that the Termination Payment is (i) not treated as a supply of
goods or a supply of services under the Law governing VAT of any applicable
European Union member state or (ii) otherwise exempt from VAT. Each Party
shall act in a manner consistent with the foregoing (including filing Tax
Returns consistent therewith) and shall contest any contrary position in a Tax
audit or similar proceeding.

136

         | (g) |

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary: 

---|---|--- 
 

(i) If the Company is required to pay Parent the Company Termination
Compensation, such Company Termination Compensation shall be paid into escrow
on the date such payment is required to be paid by the Company pursuant to
this Agreement by wire transfer of same day funds to an escrow account in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(g)_. In the event that the Company
is obligated to pay Parent the Company Termination Compensation, the amount
payable to Parent in any taxable year of Parent shall not exceed the lesser of
(I) such Company Termination Compensation, and (II) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing Parent to fail to
meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the
relevant taxable year, determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the
Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and Parent has $9,500,000 of income from
unknown sources during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition
to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in each
case, as determined by Parents independent accountants, plus (B) in the event
Parent receives either (x) a letter from Parents outside counsel indicating
that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS as described below in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.03(g)_ or (y) a written legal opinion from Parents outside
counsel as described below in this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(g)_, an amount equal
to the excess of such Company Termination Compensation, less the amount
payable under subclause (A) above.

 

(ii) To secure the Companys obligation to pay these amounts, the Company
shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to such Company Termination
Compensation with an escrow agent selected by the Company on such terms
(subject to this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(g)_) as shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow
of such Company Termination Compensation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.03(g)_ shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds at the time the
Company is obligated to pay Parent such amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.03(g)_. The escrow agreement shall provide that such Company Termination
Compensation in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to Parent
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (A)
a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without causing Parent to fail
to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income and
Parent has $9,500,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is
not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which
is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such
amount to Parent, or (B) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that (x)
Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent of
such Company Termination Compensation would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (y) Parents outside counsel has rendered a
written legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of such Company
Termination Compensation should either constitute Qualifying Income or should
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of such Company Termination Compensation to Parent. The Company
agrees to amend this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(g)_ at the reasonable request of
Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of such Company Termination
Compensation that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing
Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code, or (ii) reasonably assist Parent (at Parents expense) in obtaining a
favorable ruling from the IRS or written legal opinion from its outside
counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section_  

 



137

    

  _8.03(g)_. Any amount of such Company Termination Compensation that remains
unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible
during the following taxable year, subject to the foregoing limitations of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(g)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the of the
second calendar year beginning after the date on which the Companys
obligation to pay the Company Termination Compensation arose (or earlier if
directed by Parent), any remaining portion of the Company Termination
Compensation (together with interest thereon) then being held by the escrow
agent shall be disbursed to the Company and, in the event the Company
Termination Compensation has not be then been paid in full, such unpaid
portion shall never be due.

_Section_ __ _ 9.09_  _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_ _; Effectiveness_.
This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to email (any
such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be treated in all manner
and respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party may raise the use of an Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a Contract, and each Party hereby
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such
defense relates to lack of authenticity. This Agreement shall become
effective when each Party shall have

 



141

    

 received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by each other Party. Until
and unless each Party has received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by
each other Party, this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have
any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication).

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, including the Annexes and Exhibits hereto, the Company Letter, the
Parent Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean Team Agreement and
the other documents delivered in connection with this Agreement, constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the Transactions.
This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies; _provided_ , that (a) the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Persons) and his or her heirs and representatives and (b) the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)(vi)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.05(e)_ are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company directors in
office at the time of holding the EGM (or the Subsequent EGM, if any), and
any Independent Director as referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and all
members of the Company Board resigning at the Acceptance Time.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any material way. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.12_ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that the Parties do not perform
their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the
following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the
Chosen Courts without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the
provisions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.03_ shall not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Partys right to specific
performance and (c) the right of specific performance is an integral part of
the Transactions and without that right, none of the Parties would have
entered into this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such Order or injunction.

ANNEX I

 

OFFER CONDITIONS

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Parents and Buyers right and
obligation to extend, terminate, amend or modify the Offer pursuant to the
provisions of the Agreement, subject to any applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, neither Parent nor Buyer shall be required to accept for payment
or pay for any Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer unless, as of the scheduled Expiration Time:

A. there shall have been validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares (excluding Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee prior to the
Expiration Time) that, together with the Shares then owned by Parent or its
Affiliates, will allow Buyer to acquire at least eighty percent (80%) of the
outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted and as-converted basis on the Closing
Date (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); _provided_ that, Parent or Buyer may at
their discretion amend the reference to "eighty percent (80%)" in
the definition of Minimum Condition to "sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66
2/3%)";

 

B. the Required Approvals shall have been received and be in full force and
effect or their relevant waiting periods (and any extension thereof) shall
have expired or been terminated;

C. no applicable Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent),
entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction (collectively, the " _Legal
Restraints_ ") shall be in effect that prohibits, renders illegal or enjoins,
the consummation of the Offer, the Legal Merger, the Post-Merger Share Sale,
the Legal Demerger, the Post-Demerger Share Sale, the Asset Sale, the
Compulsory Acquisition, the Liquidation, the Second Step Distribution or the
other Transactions;

 

D. the representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.11(a)_ of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects at and as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made
at and as of the Expiration Time, (ii) set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.05(a)_
of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects (except for _de
minimis_ inaccuracies) at and as of the Expiration Time with the same effect
as though made at and as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent
expressly made at and as of an earlier date, in which case at and as of such
earlier date), (iii) set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, _Section_ __ _
3.02_, _Section_ __ _ 3.05(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.05(c)_, the second sentence
of  _Section_ __ _ 3.06(b)_ (solely with respect to any Significant
Subsidiary), _Section_ __ _ 3.23_ and _Section_ __ _ 3.24_ of the Agreement
shall be true and correct in all material respects at and as of the
Expiration Time with the same effect as though made at and as of the
Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made at and as of an earlier
date, in which case at and as of such earlier date) and (iv) set forth in
the Agreement, other than those Sections specifically identified in _clauses
(i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this _paragraph (D)_ , shall be true and correct
(disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality," "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) at and
as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made at and as of the
Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made at and as of an earlier
date, in which case at and as of such earlier date), except, in the case of
this _clau_ _se (iv)_ , where the failure to be true and correct would not
have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

   

E. the Company shall have performed or complied with, in all material
respects, each of the obligations, agreements and covenants, required to be
performed by, or complied with by, it under the Agreement at or prior to the
Expiration Time; _provided_ that no failure to perform or comply with the
Companys obligations, agreements and covenants set forth in (i) Section 7.07
shall result in a failure to satisfy the Offer Condition specified in this
_paragraph (E)_ unless (x) such failure constitutes a Financing Cooperation
Breach that remains uncured and (y) Parent has provided written notice
thereof to the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure to perform or
comply with the Companys obligations, agreements and covenants set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.04(e)_ or clause _(C)_ of the first paragraph of _Section_
__ _ 5.01_ shall not result in a failure to satisfy the Offer Condition
specified in this paragraph _(E)_ ;

 

F. since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Effect
that would have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided_ that _clause
(ii)_ of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be excluded
from such definition for the purposes of determining the satisfaction of this
_paragraph (F)_ ;

G. the resignations of the existing members of the Company Board, as
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.05(a)_ of the Agreement, shall have been
obtained;

H. the Post-Offer Reorganization Resolutions shall have been adopted at the
EGM or the Subsequent EGM (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the convening of,
and adoption of any resolutions at, the Additional EGM is not an Offer
Condition), if any, and the Parent Stockholder Approval shall have
been obtained at the Parent Stockholder Meeting;

I. the Company shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate signed by an
executive officer of the Company, dated as of the Expiration Time, certifying
that the Offer Conditions specified in _paragraphs_ _D_ , _E_ and _F_ have
been satisfied;

 

J. the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

 

K. the Registration Statement shall have been declared effective by the SEC
under the 1933 Act and a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement shall have not been issued, or, if issued, not
withdrawn, by the SEC or proceedings for that purpose shall have not been
initiated or threatened by the SEC; and

 

L. the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Offer shall have been
approved for listing on NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

The foregoing conditions in this _ANNEX I_ are for the sole benefit of Parent
and Buyer and may be asserted by Parent or Buyer regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and, other than the Minimum
Condition, may be waived, subject to applicable Law, by Parent or Buyer in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion,
in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions
shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights and obligations
of Parent or Buyer to extend, terminate, amend or 

   

 modify the Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by
Parent or Buyer at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not
be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time. In
addition, each of the foregoing conditions is independent of any of the other
foregoing conditions; the exclusion of any event from a particular condition
does not mean that such event may not be included in another condition.

 

Capitalized terms used in this _ANNEX I_ and not defined in this _ANNEX I_
shall have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement, dated as of
October 29, 2019, by and between Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (" _Parent_ "), DN
39J 7A B.V. (" _Buyer_ ") and InterXion Holding N.V. (the " _Company_ ")
(the " _Agreement_ ").

   

_SCHEDULE 3.15(o)_

 

 _ADDITIONAL PROPERTY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_

 

(a) Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, all original deeds
and documents necessary to prove title to each Real Property are in the
possession of the Company and there are no deeds or documents of title in
relation to any Real Property which are required to be registered in
accordance with applicable Law that have not been so registered, except to
the extent that the failure to register such deeds or documents would not
impair the Companys title to such Real Property.

 

(b) Except for the Customer Contracts and Permitted Liens, the Company or its
Subsidiaries are in all material respects in exclusive possession and
occupation of each Real Property and, assuming the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the applicable Property Acquisition Agreement,

or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company does not

in respect of any real property formerly owned or occupied by the Company.
