against Parent and, to the knowledge of the Parent, are in full force and effect against the Financing Sources party thereto and
have not been withdrawn or terminated. The Debt Financing Commitments are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and,
to the knowledge of Parent, the Financing Sources party thereto, and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would excuse the financing sources from their commitments thereunder. As of the date of this Agreement and assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in <U>Article IV</U> hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that
it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing of the financing to be satisfied by it contained
in the Debt Financing Commitment. As of the date hereof, and assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in <U>Article IV</U> hereof, Parent is not aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that may cause the Debt Financing Commitments
to terminate or be ineffective or any of the terms or conditions of closing of the Debt Financing not to be met or of any impediment
to the funding of the cash payment obligations of Parent under this Agreement. Parent will have at the Closing, sufficient cash,
marketable securities, available lines of credit or other sources of immediately available funds (including the Debt Financing
Commitments) to pay in full in cash all obligations of Parent and the Merger Subs pursuant to this Agreement required to be paid
in cash at the Closing, including (a) the Closing Payments and (b) all of the out-of-pocket costs of Parent, the Merger Subs and
the Surviving Company arising from the consummation of the Transactions. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Debt Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the financing contemplated
in the Debt Financing Commitments, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments. Parent
and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that their obligations pursuant to this Agreement are not subject to any conditions
regarding Parent&rsquo;s, the Merger Subs&rsquo;, their Affiliates&rsquo; or any other Person&rsquo;s ability to obtain any financing,
whether pursuant to any or all of the Debt Financing Commitments or from any other source, for the consummation of the Transactions.</P>
