(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub One shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the

corporation in the Initial Merger, and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of Merger Sub One in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL and the DLLCA,
immediately following the Effective Time, and as part of the same plan of

shall cease.

  



  

2.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ")
shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, located at 300 North
LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60654, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, on the
third (3rd) Business Day after the day on which the

  



  

   

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

conditions precedent set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, of those conditions at such time) are satisfied or waived in accordance
with this Agreement, or at such other place and time or on such other date as
the parties hereto may mutually agree in writing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event will Parent or the Merger Subs be required to consummate the
Transactions prior to August 31, 2017. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

  



  

2.03 _Effective Time_. Contemporaneously with the Closing, the
Company and Merger Sub One shall duly execute and file a certificate
of merger (the " _Initial Certificate of Merger_ ") in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. The Initial Merger shall become effective
at such time as the Initial Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Office of the Secretary of the State of the State of Delaware, unless Parent
and the Company otherwise agree and specify a subsequent date or time in the
Initial Certificate of Merger, in which case the Initial Merger shall become
effective at such subsequent date or time (the time the Initial Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ "). Immediately following the
Effective Time, the Company and Merger Sub Two shall duly execute and file a
certificate of merger (the " _Follow-On Certificate of Merger_ ") in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and DLLCA. The Follow-On
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Follow-On Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Office of the Secretary of the State of the
State of Delaware, unless Parent and the Company otherwise agree and specify a
subsequent date or time in the Follow-On Certificate of Merger, in which case
the Follow-On Certificate of Merger shall become effective at such subsequent
date or time.

  



  

2.04 _Effects of the Mergers_. The effects of the Mergers shall be
as provided in this Agreement, the Initial Certificate of Merger and the
Follow-On Certificate of Merger, as applicable, the DGCL and the DLLCA.

  



  

2.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Effective upon the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
amended and restated in a form designated by Parent prior to the Closing and
as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving
corporation in the Initial Merger as of the Effective Time, until amended in
accordance with applicable Law, and the bylaws of Merger Sub One, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
surviving corporation in the Initial Merger as of the Effective Time. The
certificate of formation of Merger Sub Two in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the Follow-On Merger shall be the certificate of formation
of the Surviving Company, and the limited liability company agreement of
Merger Sub Two in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the
Follow-On Merger shall be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

2.06 _Directors, Officers and Managers_. From and after the
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub One immediately
prior to the Initial Merger shall be the directors and officers of the
surviving company in the Initial Merger, until their successors and assigns
shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub One, applicable Law and this Agreement.
The managers of Merger Sub Two immediately prior to the effective time of the

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Company until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Company and
applicable Law.

  



  

2.07 _Plan of Reorganization_. The parties intend that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Mergers, taken together, will
constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan
of reorganization the parties adopt by executing this Agreement.

  



  

Article III

  



  

 _EFFECT OF THE MERGER_

  



  

3.01 _Effect of the Mergers on Capital Stock and Company Options_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Initial Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub One:

  



  

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub One shall automatically be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation in the Initial
Merger.

  



  

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by (A) the
Company or (B) any of Parent or Merger Sub One (or any of Parent's or Merger
Sub One's respective Affiliates) shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(iii) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other
than (A) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 3.01(a)(ii)_ and (B) the Appraisal Shares (such shares identified in
the immediately preceding clauses (A) and (B), the " _Specified Shares_ "),
shall be converted into, and shall thereafter represent the right of the
holder thereof to receive, subject to _Section 3.02(a)_ , the Per Share Common
Stock Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Company Common Stockholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock except the
right to receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration.

  



  

(iv) Each Vested Company Option that is (i) outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) held by an
Accredited Holder, shall, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any
action on the part of any party, be canceled and converted into the right to
receive (A) the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration with respect to
each Net Option Share relating to such Vested Company Option _minus_ (B) the
Applicable Withholding Amount and all such

  



  

   

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Vested Company Options shall otherwise cease to be outstanding, shall be
canceled and cease to exist.

  



  

(v) Each Vested Company Option that is (i) outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) held by a Non-
Accredited Holder, shall, by virtue of the Initial Merger and without any
action on the part of any party, be canceled and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Per Share Common Stock Merger
Consideration Cash Value with respect to each Net Option Share relating to
such Vested Company Option, _minus_ (B) the Applicable Withholding Amount, and
all such Vested Company Options shall otherwise cease to be outstanding,
shall be canceled and cease to exist.

  



  

(vi) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause to
be taken any and all actions reasonably necessary to terminate the
Company Stock Plan and to cause (i) all outstanding Company Options which are
subject solely to time-based vesting conditions to become fully vested and
exercisable as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) all
outstanding Company Options which are subject to time and performance-based
vesting conditions to become vested and exercisable as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting
conditions will be satisfied immediately following the Effective Time
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) each
outstanding Company Option that is so vested and exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the immediately preceding
clauses (i) and (ii)) to be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective
Time, and, converted into the right of the Company Optionholder thereof to
receive the consideration set forth in _Section 3.01(a)(iv)_ or _Section
3.01(a)(v)_ , as applicable.

  



  

(vii) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement setting forth the
Company's calculation of the Aggregate Closing Option Consideration,
including the amount to be paid to each Company Optionholder pursuant to
_Section 3.01(a)(iv)_ or _Section 3.01(a)(v)_ and, with respect to amounts to
be paid pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)(iv)_ , what portion of each such amount
will be paid in cash and what will be paid in shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Company Option Closing Consideration Statement_ ")). The Company
Option Closing Consideration Statement shall specify the number of Company
Options held by each Company Optionholder that are vested and exercisable as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any
performance-based vesting conditions that will be satisfied immediately
following the Effective Time after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each outstanding Company Option that is not vested and
exercisable as of the Effective Time in accordance with this _Section
3.01(a)_ , and each Vested Company Option which has an exercise price equal
to or greater than the Per Share Portion of the Estimated Merger
Consideration, shall automatically be cancelled and terminated as of the
Effective Time for no portion of the Aggregate Closing Option Consideration
and without ongoing liability to Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other consideration. In each case, all payments or
delivery of Aggregate Closing Option Consideration shall be made by or on
behalf of the Surviving

  



  

   

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Company to such Company Optionholder no later than the next payroll payment
date, but in no event sooner than five (5) Business Days, after the Closing
Date.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_
") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any Company Common Stockholder who is entitled
to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Common Stock Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(a)(iii)_
, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the
Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and each such
Appraisal Share shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time
into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Per Share Common Stock
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(a)(iii)_. The Company shall
deliver prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands for appraisal, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in
any event, at least 20 days prior to the Closing Date), the Company shall
mail or cause to be mailed or otherwise delivered to each Company Common
Stockholder a Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the form of _Exhibit
D_ attached hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall include the obligation of each Company Common
Stockholder to agree to _Section 10.15_ of this Agreement, together with
notices delivered pursuant to Section 262 and a request to have such Company
Common Stockholder deliver an executed Letter of Transmittal and, if
applicable, an executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8, as
applicable, to the Paying Agent, no less than three Business Days prior to
the Closing. Upon the delivery of any duly executed Letter of Transmittal
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, together with any
other documentation expressly required by its terms to be provided in
connection with such Letter of Transmittal, each Company Common Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive, at or after the Effective Time, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration
in respect of each of its, his or her shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Specified Shares) in accordance with _Section 3.01(a)(iii)_ ,
_Section 3.02(b)_ and _Section 3.06_. The Paying Agent and the Company shall
provide the Securityholder Representative and Parent with a copy of each
Letter of Transmittal it receives prior to or as of the Effective Time.

  



  

   

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Computershare shall act, at Parent's expense, as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") in effecting the exchanges of Company Common Stock
provided for herein pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement, which will be in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent, the Securityholder Representative and
the Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "). Following delivery of a
duly executed Letter of Transmittal completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and _Section 3.02(a) _ above and an executed IRS Form
W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8, as applicable: each Company Common
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive (and Parent shall direct the Paying
Agent to pay), in exchange for each share of Company Common Stock such
Company Common Stockholder holds (other than Specified Shares) (A) on the
Closing Date or as promptly as practicable thereafter (if such Company Common
Stockholder has delivered such Letter of Transmittal at least three Business
Days prior to the Closing Date) or, after the Closing, within three Business
Days of receipt of such Letter of Transmittal, the Per Share Closing Cash
Amount and the Per Share Stock Amount and (B) the Per Share Additional Merger
Consideration, if any, at the time of its distribution pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) For all purposes of this _Section 3.02_ and for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), each Company Common Stockholder will be treated as having
surrendered, in exchange for the Aggregate Stockholder Cash Consideration to
be paid to such Company Common Stockholder pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)(iii)_
, a number of shares of Company Common Stock (which are specifically
identified by such stockholder in the Letter of Transmittal to be the shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged for such stockholder's Aggregate Stockholder
Cash Consideration) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock held by such stockholder and converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Common Stock Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement and (ii) the Cash Ratio.

  



  

3.03 _Estimated Merger Consideration; Certain Closing Date
Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. At least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent (i)
an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the
Determination Time, in the same form and including the same line items as the
Latest Balance Sheet, and (ii) a statement (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth the Company's good faith calculation of the
Estimated Merger Consideration, including (A) the estimated amount of Working
Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), (B) the estimated amount of
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (C) the estimated amount of
Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_ "), and (D) the estimated amount of the Company
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Company Transaction Expenses_ "), in
each case of clauses (A) through (D), as of the Determination Time and based
on the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, together with
reasonable supporting detail of each of the calculations set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement. Parent shall be entitled to review the Estimated
Closing Statement prior to the Closing and to submit comments thereon to the
Company. The Company shall consider in good faith any such comments and may
(but is not required to) revise the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the
Closing to reflect such comments. To the extent the Company does not accept
Parent's comments, the Estimated Closing Statement shall be in the form
initially presented to Parent pursuant to this _Section 3.03(a)_. No comments
delivered by

  



  

   

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Parent, or Parent's failure to deliver any comments, will be deemed to
constitute any waiver or release of any of Parent's rights under this
Agreement, including _Section 3.06_.

  



  

(b) _Certain Closing Date Payments_. In each case subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Parent shall:

  



  

(i) deposit, or cause to be deposited, to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement, (A) certificates or evidence of
book-entry shares representing a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Aggregate Share Amount and (B) cash representing the Aggregate
Base Cash Amount, less the amounts to be deposited to the Surviving Company
pursuant to _Section 3.03(b)(ii)_.

  



  

(ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, (i) to the Surviving Company,
for payment to each Company Optionholder who is an Accredited Holder, the Per
Share Closing Cash Amount for each Net Option Share relating to each
outstanding Vested Company Option payable at Closing pursuant to _Section
3.01(a)(iv)_ and (ii) to the Surviving Company for payment to each holder of
Vested Company Options who is a Non-Accredited Holder, cash in an amount
equal to the consideration for each outstanding Cashed-Out Option payable
at Closing pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)(v)_ , in each case, as set forth in
the Company Option Closing Consideration Statement.

  



  

(iii) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Escrow Agent an amount

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

to the nearest ten thousandth when expressed in decimal form) by (ii) the
Average Parent Share Price. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock or
Company Options formerly pursuant to this _Section 3.03(e)_ , Parent shall
pay, or cause the Paying Agent to pay, such amounts to such holders.

3.06 _Post-Closing Determination of Merger Consideration Adjustment;
Transaction Accounting Principles_.

  



  

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent __ shall deliver
to the Securityholder Representative (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the Determination Time, in the same form and including the same
line items as the Latest Balance Sheet, and (ii) a statement (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth Parent's good faith calculation of the Company's
Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each
case, as of the Determination Time, if applicable, together with reasonable
supporting detail of each of the calculations set forth in the Closing
Statement.

  



  

(b) During the 45 days immediately following the Securityholder
Representative's receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ "),
the Securityholder Representative and its Representatives shall be permitted,
at reasonable times and following reasonable advance notice, to review
Parent's working papers and the working papers of Parent's
independent accountants, if any, relating to the preparation of the Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and
Company Transaction Expenses therein, as well as the relevant books and
records of the Company and Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
independent accountants of Parent shall not be obligated to make any working
papers available to the Securityholder Representative unless and until the
Securityholder Representative has signed a customary confidentiality and
hold harmless agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to such independent accountants. The
Securityholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if the
Securityholder Representative disagrees with the Closing Statement or the
Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash or Company Transaction Expenses set forth
therein. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

in reasonable detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved
and the Securityholder Representative's determination of the amount of the
Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each
case, as of the applicable Determination Time, together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation.

  



  

(c) During the 30 days immediately following the delivery of a
Notice of Disagreement, the Securityholder Representative and Parent
shall seek in good faith to resolve any disagreement that they may have with
respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If no Notice
of Disagreement is received by Parent on or prior to the expiration date of
the Review Period, then the Closing Statement and the Working Capital,
Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing
Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Securityholder
Representative and shall become final and binding upon Parent and the Equity
Holders. If the parties cannot agree on the Working Capital, Indebtedness,
Cash and Company Transaction Expenses within such 30 day period, the Working
Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and/or Company Transaction Expenses, in each case
solely to the extent not agreed between the Securityholder Representative and
Parent, shall be determined by Houlihan Lokey (such firm or any replacement
firm appointed pursuant to the terms of this _Section 3.06(c)_ , the "
_Referee_ "). The Securityholder Representative and Parent shall furnish the
Referee with a statement setting forth the items from the Notice of
Disagreement which are still in dispute (the " _Referee Dispute Notice_ ");
_provided_ , that all items which are not in dispute, and thus not included
on the Referee Dispute Notice and/or Notice of Disagreement, shall be
considered final and binding. In the event that Houlihan Lokey refuses or is
otherwise unable to act as the Referee, the Securityholder Representative and
Parent shall cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent certified
public accounting firm or a nationally recognized financial
advisory valuation firm in the United States of national recognition mutually
agreeable to the Securityholder Representative and Parent, in which event
"Referee" shall mean such firm. Within 30 days after the submission of such
matters to the Referee, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Referee,
acting as an expert and not as an arbiter, will make a final
determination (based only on this Agreement and the information provided by
the Securityholder Representative and Parent), binding on the
Securityholder Representative and Parent, of the appropriate amount of each
of the line items in the Closing Statement as to which there is
disagreement as specified in the Referee Dispute Notice. With respect to each
disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the
position of either the Securityholder Representative or Parent, shall not be
in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts specified by
either the Securityholder Representative in the Notice of Disagreement or
Parent in the Closing Statement with respect to such disputed line item. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Referee shall not review any line items or make
any determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Referee Dispute Notice that are in dispute. The statement of each of Working
Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses, in each case, as
of the Determination Time, and the determination of the Working Capital,
Indebtedness, Cash and Company Transaction Expenses therefrom that are
final and binding on the Securityholder Representative and Parent, as
determined either through agreement of the Securityholder Representative and
Parent (deemed in accordance with the second sentence of this _Section
3.06(c)_ or otherwise evidenced in writing and executed by each of the
Securityholder Representative and Parent) or through the determination of the
Referee pursuant to this  _Section 3.06(c)_ are referred to herein as the "
_Final Working Capital_ ," " _Final Indebtedness_ ," " _Final Cash_ ," and "
_Final Company Transaction Expenses_ ," respectively.

  



  

   

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

During the review by the Referee, the Securityholder Representative and
Parent shall each make available to the Referee such individuals and such
information, books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably requested by
the Referee to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 3.06(c)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the independent accountants of the
Securityholder Representative or Parent shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Referee unless and until the Referee has
signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to
such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such independent accountants. All discussions related to the Notice of
Disagreement shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence
and any applicable similar state statute unless otherwise agreed by the
Securityholder Representative and Parent.

  



  

(d) The cost of the Referee's review and determination shall be
borne on a proportionate basis by Parent, on the one hand, and the Equity
Holders, on the other (whose share shall be paid on their behalf by the
Securityholder Representative from the Securityholder Representative Expense
Amount), based on the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded in favor of each such Person bears to the aggregate amount actually
contested.

  



  

(e) The " _Final_ _Merger Consideration_ " shall be calculated by
recalculating the Estimated Merger Consideration using the Final Working
Capital in lieu of the Estimated Working Capital, using the Final Indebtedness
in lieu of Estimated Indebtedness, using Final Cash in lieu of Estimated Cash
and using the Final Company Transaction Expenses in lieu of Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses and otherwise using the components of Estimated Merger
Consideration as set forth in the definition of Estimated Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Merger Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the "
_Deficiency Amount_ "), Parent shall be paid by wire transfer of same day
funds promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after the Final
Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Cash and Final Company Transaction
Expenses have been agreed upon (through deemed agreement or otherwise) or
determined by the Referee, in either case in accordance with _Section 3.06(c)_
), such Deficiency Amount from the Escrow Account; _provided_ , _however_ ,
in no event shall any Equity Holder have personal liability for payment of
such amount or any portion thereof, and Parent's and its Affiliates' sole
recourse with respect thereto shall be the Escrow Funds held by the Escrow
Agent.

  



  

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Merger Consideration paid at the Closing (such amount, the " _Excess Amount_
"), Parent shall promptly (but in any event within five Business Days after
the Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Cash and Final Company
Transaction Expenses have been agreed or determined by the Referee in
accordance with  _Section 3.06(c)_ ), pay in accordance with _Section
3.06(f)_ , (x) the portion of the Excess Amount payable to the Company Common
Stockholders by wire transfer of same day funds to the Paying Agent (on behalf
of and as agent of the Company Common Stockholders) and (y) the portion of
the Excess Amount payable to the Company Optionholders to the Surviving
Company (on behalf of and as agent of the Company Optionholders).

  



  

   

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) If any Escrow Funds remain in the Escrow Account, after the
payment of the Deficiency Amount (or upon payment of the Excess Amount if
there is no Deficiency Amount) (such amount, the " _Remaining Amount_ "), then
Parent and the Securityholder Representative shall cause the Remaining Amount
to be paid by the Escrow Agent as follows, (x) the portion of the Remaining
Amount payable to the Company Common Stockholders by wire transfer of same
day funds to the Paying Agent (on behalf of and as agent of the Company
Common Stockholders) and (y) the portion of the Remaining Amount payable to
the Company Optionholders to the Surviving Company (on behalf of and as agent
of the Company Optionholders).

  



  

Parent and the Securityholder Representative hereby agree to deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to deliver promptly from the Escrow Account all funds to be
delivered in accordance with this _Section 3.06(e)_.

  



  

(f) All payments made to the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Company
Common Stockholders) and the Surviving Company (on behalf of the
Company Optionholders) pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 3.06(e)_
shall be further paid as follows:

  



  

(i) to each Company Common Stockholder, an amount equal to the
product of (A) the Per Share Portion, _multiplied by_ (B) the
aggregate amount payable pursuant to _Section 3.06(e)(ii)_ or _Section
3.06(e)(iii)_ , as applicable, _multiplied by_ (C) the aggregate number of
such shares of Company Common Stock held by such Company Common Stockholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Specified Shares)
without interest; and

  



  

(ii) to each Company Optionholder, an amount equal to the product of
(A) the Per Share Portion, _multiplied by_ (B) the aggregate amount payable
pursuant to _Section 3.06(e)(ii)_ or _Section 3.06(e)(iii)_ , as applicable,
_multiplied by_ (C) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying the Vested Company Options held by such Company
Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than those
Company Options cancelled for no Aggregate Closing Option
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ ), without interest and net of
any amounts that are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or
any applicable provision of Law;

  



  

 _provided_ , that all such payments shall be made in accordance with Section
409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(g) _Transaction Accounting Principles_. Each of the Estimated
Closing Statement (including the Estimated Working Capital, Estimated
Indebtedness, Estimated Cash and Estimated Company Transaction Expenses) and
the Closing Statement (including the Working Capital, Indebtedness, Cash and
Company Transaction Expenses) shall be prepared and calculated in accordance
with the definitions of such terms contained in the Agreement and the
Transaction Accounting Principles, except that the Estimated Closing Statement
and the Closing Statement (and all calculations set forth in each, including
the calculation of the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Final
Merger Consideration) shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist
up to the applicable Determination Time (or such other applicable calculation
time as expressly set forth herein) and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision or

  



  

   

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

event occurring after the Determination Time (or such other applicable
calculation time as expressly set forth herein).

  



  

3.07 _Escrow_. In accordance with _Section 3.03(b)(iii)_ , Parent
shall deliver to Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), as agent to
Parent and the Equity Holders, an amount equal to the Escrow Funds in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.03_ , which Escrow Funds shall
be held by the Escrow Agent in an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_
") pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement and used for purposes
of any payments payable to Parent or the Equity Holders pursuant to _Section
3.06_.

  



  

3.08 _Withholding Tax_. Each of Parent, the Company, and their
respective agents (including the Paying Agent) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any payment or delivery of consideration pursuant to
this Agreement (including a payment of Parent Common Stock) such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any payment or delivery
of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement under the Code or
any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Company, or their respective agents,
as the case may be, and timely remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid or delivered to such holders in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Unless any delay would materially and
adversely affect Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, before making any such
deduction or withholding (other than on account of payroll, wage
withholding, employment or other similar Taxes), with respect to payments to
Company Common Stockholders in respect of Company Common Stock, Parent, the
Company or their respective agents, as applicable, shall give the
Securityholder Representative reasonable advance notice of any anticipated
withholding (together with the legal basis therefor), provide the applicable
Person with sufficient opportunity to provide any forms or other
documentation or take such other steps in order to avoid such withholding, and
the Securityholder Representative and Parent will reasonably cooperate in
good faith to attempt to reduce any amounts that would otherwise be
deducted and withheld pursuant to this _Section 3.08_.

  



  

3.09 _Conversion of Shares in the Follow-On Merger_. At the
effective time of the Follow-On Merger, by virtue of the Follow-On Merger
and without any action on the part of any party, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company as the surviving corporation in the
Initial Merger issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Follow-On Merger shall be converted into and become one limited
liability company interest of the Surviving Company, and each limited
liability company interest in Merger Sub Two issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Follow-On Merger shall
remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest of the Surviving
Company.

collectively with any related term sheets, the " _Financing Commitment

issues discount or up-front fees) or availability of the Debt Financing)

other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the
full amount of the financing contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitments,
other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments. Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree that their
obligations pursuant to this Agreement are not subject to any
conditions regarding Parent's, the Merger Subs', their Affiliates' or any

laws of the states of the United States.

would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.12 _Application of Takeover Protections; Rights Agreement_. Parent
and its board of directors have taken all necessary action, if any, in order
to render inapplicable any control stock acquisition, business combination,
poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other
similar anti-takeover provision under the certificate of incorporation of
Parent which is or could become applicable to the Company as a result of the
Transactions, including Parent's issuance of the Parent Shares and each of
the New Stockholder's ownership of the Parent Shares. Parent and its board of
directors have taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render
inapplicable any stockholder rights plan or similar arrangement relating to
accumulations of beneficial ownership of the Parent Shares or a change in
control of Parent.

  



  

5.13 _SEC Documents_.

  



  

(a) Since October 31, 2015, Parent has filed with, or furnished to,
as applicable, the SEC all registration statements, prospectuses,
reports, forms, statements, schedules, certifications and other documents
required to be filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the SEC by Parent
(together with all exhibits and schedules thereto and all information
incorporated therein by reference, collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, or if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents (i) complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended (to the extent then applicable), and (ii) did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading in any material respect.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of Parent
(including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the
Parent SEC Documents (i) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and (ii) fairly presents in all material respects, as
applicable, the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results
of Parent's and its Subsidiaries' operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated (except, in the case of each of sub-clauses (i) and (ii), that
Parent's unaudited interim financial statements were subject to normal year-
end and quarter-end adjustments, and subject to the absence of footnotes in
such unaudited interim financial statements).

agreement providing any person or entity any rights (including
piggyback registration rights) to have any securities of Parent registered
with the Securities and Exchange Commission or registered or qualified with
any other Governmental Entity.

  



  

5.15 _No Shareholder Approval_. The entry into this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions (including the issuance and delivery by
Parent of the Parent Shares to the New Stockholders) do not require any vote
or other approval or authorization of any holder of any capital stock of
Parent.

  



  

5.16 _Reorganization_. To the knowledge of Parent following
discussions with its relevant advisors, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take any action that is not contemplated
by this Agreement and that would reasonably be expected to prevent the
Initial Merger and the Follow-On Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

5.17 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS AND THE

of the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 4.13(a) _ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to
give Company Non-Union Employees full credit for such Company Non-
Union Employees' service with the Company and its Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits (including

the same purpose as recognized by the Company immediately prior to the

any class or level of employees or officers of Parent or any of its
Affiliates in which a Company Non-Union Employee is eligible to

  



  

   

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

participate and actually participates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service.

  



  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting
condition limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their
eligible dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that
provides health benefits in which Company Employees may be eligible to
participate following the Closing, to the extent waived or satisfied with
respect to such employees as of the Closing under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) honor any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums incurred by Company Employees and their eligible dependents under the
health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing
during the portion of the plan year prior to the Closing in satisfying
any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of
Parent or any of its Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate
after the Closing in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments
or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to a Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Closing, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or
eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under
an analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Closing.

  



  

(d) With respect to Company Union Represented Employees, the
Surviving Company shall or shall cause its Affiliates to, as applicable,

(e) If a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section

any payment or other benefit that is contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code), and such payment or other benefit may not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code if the stockholder approval
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code are not satisfied, then the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from each
"disqualified individual" that would receive payments and/or benefits that
would separately or in the aggregate constitute "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code (" _Parachute Payments_
"), waivers that provide that no Parachute Payments with respect to such
"disqualified individual" shall, in the absence of 280G Stockholder Approval
(as defined below), be payable to or retained by such "disqualified
individual" to the extent such Parachute Payments would not be deductible by
reason of the application of Section 280G of the Code or would result in the
imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code on such
"disqualified individual" (the " _280G Waivers_ "). Following the execution
of the 280G Waivers, and prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall seek
approval by its stockholders, in a manner intended to comply with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, of the right of any "disqualified individual" to
receive or retain any Parachute Payments (the " _280G Stockholder Approval_
"). The Company shall provide Parent, at least five (5)

this _Section 6.04(e)_ and the calculations prepared under Section 280G of the

(f) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set
forth in this _Section 6.04_ shall not create any right in any Company
Employee or any other person to any continued employment with the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, successors, or assigns.

  



  

6.05 _Publicity_. The initial press release announcing this
Agreement, any ancillary agreements and the transactions contemplated herein
shall be in substantially the form mutually agreed upon by Parent, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand. No other press release, public
announcement or public filing related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or
communication to the employees, customers or suppliers of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made by any party hereto without the prior
written approval of Parent, the Securityholder Representative and the Company
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
unless required by Law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) or the rules
and regulations of an applicable securities exchange, in which case, Parent,
on the one hand, and the Company and the Securityholder Representative, on
the other hand, shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other and provide the other party the right to review such
press release, announcement, public filing or communication prior to
issuance, distribution or publication, in each case, to the extent
practicable; _provided_ that no party shall be required to obtain approval or
provide materials for review to the extent that the applicable press release,
announcement, public filing or communication consists of information that has
previously been made public without breach of the obligations under this 
_Section 6.05_. The parties understand and agree that Parent intends to
publicly disclose the existence of this Agreement and the Transactions
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement as required pursuant to the
rules or regulations of an applicable securities exchange; _provided_ that
any such initial disclosure shall require the joint approval of Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Securityholder Representative, on the other
hand (which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld). For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties acknowledge and agree that Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.
(" _THL_ ") and its Affiliates and Goldman Sachs and Co. (" _GS_ ") and its
Affiliates (in each case, except for the Company and its Subsidiaries) may
provide information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to their respective limited partners and
investors in the ordinary course of business, subject to
customary confidentiality obligations with respect thereto.

provided to it and its Representatives in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the terms of the

(a) Prior to the Closing Date and subject to applicable Laws and
_Section 6.06_ , Parent shall be entitled, through its officers,
employees and Representatives (including its legal advisors, accountants and
financing sources), to have such access to the information, properties,
businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and such
examination of the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
it reasonably requests upon reasonable advance written notice. Any such access
and examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under
circumstances that do not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the business, and shall be subject to restrictions under
applicable Law. The Company shall cause the officers, employees,
consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys and other Representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent and
Parent's Representatives in connection with such access and examination, and
Parent and its Representatives shall cooperate with the Company and its
Representatives and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the business. Any disclosure during such
investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall not constitute any
enlargement or additional representation or warranty of the Company beyond
those specifically set forth in _Article IV_. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, no such access or examination shall be permitted to the
extent that it (i) relates to the negotiation of this Agreement and the
Transactions, (ii) would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) would require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose information that in the reasonable judgment and good
faith of counsel to the Company, is subject to attorney-client privilege or
may conflict with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligations to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in each such case, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take those actions reasonably necessary so that the
Company or its Subsidiaries is able to provide such information to Parent or
a Representative of Parent (which efforts shall not require the Company to
waive its attorney-client privilege or violate any Contract or applicable
Law).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, prior
to the Closing, (i) without the written consent of the Company (which may
be withheld in the Company's sole discretion), Parent shall not contact any
customers of the Company or any Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary course
of the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to matters not
related to the Company or its Subsidiaries, and provided that the Company
shall have the right to have one Representative present during any such
contact in the event that it consents to such contact, and (ii) Parent shall
have no right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the
properties or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the
prior written consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld for any
reason).

  



  

6.08 _Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) The Company, Parent and the Merger Subs will, as promptly as
practicable and no later than five (5) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the
United States Department of Justice, the notification form required pursuant
to the HSR Act for the Transactions, which form will specifically request
early termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act. The
Company, Parent and the Merger Subs will use reasonable best efforts to make
all other

  



  

   

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

necessary filings with such Governmental Entities as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent and the
Merger Subs will furnish to each other's counsel such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act or any such other necessary filings and will provide any supplemental
information requested by any Governmental Entity as promptly as practicable.
The Company, Parent and the Merger Subs will use all reasonable best efforts
to comply as promptly as practicable with any requests made for any additional
information in connection with such filings. Parent will be responsible for
all filing fees payable in connection with such filings and,
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, will direct the strategy for
obtaining any necessary consents, authorizations, clearances, or
approvals required pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law,
including (i) the scheduling of, and strategic planning for, any meeting with
any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition
Law, (ii) the process for the receipt of any necessary approvals, and (iii)
the resolution of any investigation or other inquiry of any such Governmental
Entity, and its decisions with respect thereto will control.

  



  

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the Company,
Parent and the Merger Subs will use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the
Transactions and will keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, any Governmental Entity and will comply promptly with any such inquiry
or request, and the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to provide
full and effective support to Parent in respect thereof to the extent
requested by Parent. Parent and the Merger Subs will take, and will cause
their Affiliates to take, any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to enable the parties to
expeditiously close the Transactions, including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of its assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired in the
Transactions, and entering into such other arrangements, as necessary in
order to avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction or other order in
any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of materially
delaying or preventing the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) opposing or
defending through completion of litigation on the merits any claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity or
other Person challenging the Transactions under any Law, including as
reasonably necessary to appeal and overturn any Order preventing or enjoining
the Transactions, and (iii) agreeing to such limitations on conduct or
actions of members of Parent and its Affiliates after the Closing as may be
required in order to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.01
prior to the Outside Date.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto agree to instruct their respective counsel to
cooperate with each other and use reasonable best efforts to facilitate and
expedite the identification and resolution of any issues arising under the HSR
Act at the earliest practicable dates. Such reasonable best efforts and
cooperation include counsel's undertaking (i) to keep each other
appropriately informed of material communications from and to personnel of
the reviewing Governmental Entities and (ii) to confer with each other
regarding appropriate contacts with and response to personnel of such
Governmental Entities and the content of any such contacts or

  



  

   

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

presentations. The Company, Parent and the Merger Subs will not participate in
any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity with respect of any
such filings, applications, investigation or other inquiry without giving the
other party prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent
permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meeting or discussion (which, at the request of either
Parent or the Company, will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only).
Each of Parent and the Company will have the right to review (subject to
appropriate redactions for confidentiality and attorney-client privilege
concerns) the content of any presentations, white papers or other written
materials to be submitted to any Governmental Entity in advance of any
such submission, and Parent will consider any of the Company's comments
thereto in good faith.

  



  

(d) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, the Company,
Parent and the Merger Subs will not take any action, or refrain from taking
any action, the effect of which would reasonably be expected to delay or
impede the ability of the parties to consummate the Transactions to a date
later than the Outside Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
prior to the Closing, Parent and the Merger Subs will not, and will not
permit any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives to, acquire or
agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner),
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably
be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other
approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Transactions
or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period prior to
the Outside Date, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, or
(iii) materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

  



  

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries, Parent and the Merger Subs
will, as promptly as practicable, make any required filings in
connection with the facility security clearances held by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and make any filings and provide any information requested by a
Governmental Entity from a party hereto in respect of the facility security
clearances, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable as required
under applicable Laws any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by a Governmental Entity, as applicable, in
connection with complying with any facility security clearances and obtaining
any facility security clearances required under applicable Law with respect to
the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have
under any Company Benefit Plan, from the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving Company
shall, indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time) and former officer or director of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Individuals_ ") against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,

  



  

   

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees
and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, to the extent arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that
the Indemnified Individual is or was an officer or director, of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the other transactions and
actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the extent required to be indemnified by the
Company under any indemnification provision contained in the governing
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as applicable) as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and/or pursuant to any indemnity
agreements between the Company and any such Person, in each case that continue
to be in effect at the Effective Time (the " _Indemnity Agreements_ "). In
the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (A)
each Indemnified Individual will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
the governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as applicable)
and the Indemnity Agreements (as applicable) upon receipt of an undertaking
by such Indemnified Individual to repay such advances if it is ultimately
cleared in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Individual is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder or thereunder, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in
any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim
(and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Individual
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes a full and
unconditional release of such Indemnified Individual from all liability or
potential liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim or such Indemnified Individual otherwise consents and
(C) the Surviving Company shall have the right to control the
defense thereof.

  



  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
governing documents) of each of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors, managers and officers than are set forth in the respective
organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (as applicable)
(or equivalent governing documents) as of the Effective Time, which
provisions, along with any Indemnity Agreements, shall not be amended,
repealed, terminated or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals, in each case, except and only to
the extent as required by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The Company shall purchase prior to the Effective Time a "tail"
insurance policy for a period of six years after the Effective Time, with
reputable and financially sound carriers of at least the same coverage and
amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous
than the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising
from or related to facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective
Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to take, and the Surviving
Company shall take, all necessary actions to maintain such policies in full
force and effect and fulfill its obligations thereunder throughout such six-
year period following the Effective Time.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Individual on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
_Section 6.09_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

  



  

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Individuals and their
respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such
individual is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Company or Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.09_.

  



  

(g) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of
expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which any Indemnified Individual may at any time be entitled.

be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder
or now or hereafter existing at Law or in equity or otherwise.

  



  

6.10 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to do or
cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable,
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements,
and in any event, no later than the Outside Date, including: (a) the
satisfaction (but not waiver) of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties; (b) the obtaining of applicable consents,
waivers or approvals of any Governmental Entities or third parties; (c) the
defending of any Actions challenging this Agreement or the performance of the
obligations hereby; and (d) the execution and delivery of such instruments,
and the taking of such other actions, as the other party may reasonably
require in order to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent, the Merger Subs nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be obligated to make any non-de minimis payments
or otherwise pay any non-de minimis consideration to any third party to
obtain any applicable consent, waiver or approval.

  



  

6.11 _Debt Financing; Financing Assistance_.

  



  

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause
its Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to

contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the terms and conditions
described therein as promptly as possible following the date hereof, and (v)
enforce all of its rights under the Debt Financing Commitments (or any
definitive documentation related thereto).

  



  

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to negotiate and enter
into definitive credit or loan or other agreements and all other
documentation with respect to the financings contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitments as may be necessary for Parent to obtain such funds on
terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the
Debt Financing Commitments (except to the extent agreed by Parent in its sole
reasonable discretion), including with respect to conditionality, and
otherwise on terms and conditions which do not materially impair the ability
of Parent to perform its obligations hereunder or to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any
event on or prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed regarding the status of the definitive agreements
and documentation with respect to the Debt Financing promptly upon request by
the Company and, upon request of the Company, deliver complete copies of
drafts and copies of executed definitive agreements and documentation.

  



  

(c) Parent shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, any
Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement or
documentation referred to in this _Section 6.11_ (except in compliance with
the flex provisions) in any manner to add any conditionality or otherwise
amend or alter any condition or any other term, which other term would
reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent shall keep the
Company informed with respect to all material activity concerning the
status of the Debt Financing Commitments (including the occurrence of any
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would give rise to any breach or default) by any party
to the Debt Financing Commitments) that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair, materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) notify the Company of (i) the expiration or
termination (or attempted, threatened or purported termination, whether or
not valid) of the Debt Financing Commitments and (ii) any refusal of a
Financing Source to provide, or any stated intent of a Financing Source to
refuse to provide, the full financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments, in each case, notwithstanding the reasonable best efforts of
Parent to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.11_ , and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange for alternative
financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") which shall be in an amount
sufficient to pay, when added with the other financing under the Debt
Financing Commitments, the aggregate consideration and all necessary fees,
expenses and other amounts in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (and which do not, without the prior written consent of the
Company, include any conditions that are more onerous than or in addition to
the conditions set forth in, or that otherwise involve
additional conditionality to, the Debt Financing Commitments) to replace the

  



  

   

 | 67| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

financing contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments or
arrangements or for which such Financing Source has refused to provide such
financing. Parent shall deliver to the Company correct and complete copies of
any modified or replaced Debt Financing Commitment (with any such fee letter
redacted in a manner consistent with the fee letter delivered to the Company
prior to or on the date hereof) as promptly as practicable following
the execution thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include the Alternative Financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments as permitted by this _Section 6.11(c)_ to be amended,
modified or replaced, and references to the "Debt Financing Commitments"
shall include such documents as permitted by this _Section 6.11(c) _ to be
amended, modified or replaced, in each case from and after such amendment,
modification or replacement.

  



  

(d) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the obligations
set forth in _Section 6.11(e)_ through _(h)_ , the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective employees have no responsibility for any
financing that Parent may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than following Closing). Parent also acknowledges
and agrees that its obtaining financing is not a condition to any of its
obligations hereunder, regardless of the reasons why financing is not obtained
or whether such reasons are within or beyond the control of Parent. For the
avoidance of doubt, if any financing referred to in this _Section 6.11_ is
not obtained, Parent shall continue to be obligated to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to and on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing (or the
earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_), subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.11_ , the Company will, will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives to, cooperate with Parent and the Merger Subs as
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of any Debt
Financing; _provided_ that nothing herein will require such cooperation to
the extent it unreasonably interferes, or would unreasonably be expected to
interfere, with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Such cooperation will include using reasonable best efforts to
(i) furnish Parent with the financial statements and other information which
are necessary to satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraph 9 of Exhibit D
of the Debt Commitment Letter and such other financial information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent shall reasonably request from the
Company, to the extent necessary to allow Parent to prepare pro forma
financial statements of Parent, that are necessary to satisfy the condition
set forth in paragraph 7 of Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter, it
being understood that neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be
responsible for any adjustments to be made in such pro forma financial
statements, (ii) participate in (including using its reasonable best efforts

Financing Sources and prospective lenders in connection with the Debt
Financing and using reasonable best efforts to provide reasonable assistance
to Parent and the Merger Subs in their preparation of any customary bank
information memoranda, lender presentations and ratings agency presentations
(including using reasonable best efforts to cause the execution and delivery
of customary authorization letters in connection with such materials), (iii)
facilitate the taking of all corporate or other organizational actions by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to entering definitive
financing documents to the extent reasonably requested or necessary in
connection with the consummation of the Debt Financing (it being

  



  

   

 | 68| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

understood that directors, officers and employees who will not continue in
such capacity as of the Closing Date shall not be required to take such
actions in connection with the financing), (iv) provide all documentation and
other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably
requested by any Financing Source at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and that is required by U.S. regulatory authorities under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, and (v) facilitate the pledging of
collateral and assisting Parent and its Financing Sources with matters
relating to title to assets or property and the execution and delivery of
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing, ( _provided_ , that (A)
none of the documents or certificates shall be executed and/or delivered
except in connection with, or contingent upon, the Closing, (B) the
effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after,
the occurrence of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be imposed on the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or
employees involved); _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company will not be required to deliver or
cause the delivery of any legal opinions or any certificate as to solvency or
any other certificate related to the Debt Financing.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding this _Section 6.11_ or anything else in this
Agreement,

  



  

(i)  in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to pay any commitment fee or other fee or payment to obtain consent,
or to incur any liability with respect to, or cause or permit any Encumbrance
to be placed on any of their respective assets in connection with, any debt
financing prior to the Effective Time; and

  



  

(ii) nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall require any action that
would conflict with or violate the Company's or any
Subsidiaries' organizational documents or any Laws or result in the
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or a default under, any contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  



  

(g) Parent will promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company, as applicable, for all fees, costs and expenses (including fees and
expenses of Representatives) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives in

hold harmless the Equity Holders, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives from and against all losses,
damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of any debt financing and any information used
in connection therewith. Parent and the Merger Subs acknowledge and agree
that their obligations pursuant to this Agreement are not subject to any
conditions regarding Parent's, Merger Subs', their Affiliates' or any other
Person's ability to obtain any financing for the consummation of the
Transactions.

  



  

(h) The parties agree that this _Section 6.11_ sets forth the
Company's sole obligations with respect to any financing or
contemplated financing of Parent and/or the Merger Subs.

businesses or assets.

  



  

6.17 _Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. At the Closing or, if due thereafter,
promptly when due thereafter, all Transfer Taxes, whether imposed on the
Company or its Subsidiaries or imposed on any holder of Company Common Stock
or Company Options resulting from the Transactions will be paid by Parent or
the Surviving Company. Parent and the Surviving Company will prepare any Tax
Returns with respect to such Taxes, and the Securityholder Representative
will cooperate with Parent and the Surviving Company in the preparation and
filing of such Tax Returns.

  



  

(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Surviving Company and
the Securityholder Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by any other party hereto, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or any Tax Claims. Such cooperation will include
providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explaining any materials provided pursuant to this
_Section 6.17(b)_.

  



  

(c) _Certain Tax Elections_. None of Parent, the Merger Subs, the
Company or any of their Affiliates will make any election under Sections 338
or 336(e) of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local or foreign
Law) with respect to the Transactions.

  



  

(d) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Company shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_ ") on a basis consistent with past
practices and timely pay or cause to be timely paid all Taxes required to be
paid by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date.
The Company shall submit drafts of any material Pre-Closing Tax Returns to
Parent not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for such Pre-
Closing Tax Retuns for Parent's review and approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Not less than three (3)
Business Days after the payment of any Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Return, the Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to,
deliver to Parent a copy of a receipt of such Tax payment or other evidence of
such Tax payment reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

  



  

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Other than the Seller Acquisition
Merger Agreement, all Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation or other
similar agreements between or among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any other Equity Holder or any Affiliate thereof, on the
other hand, including any agreement pursuant to which the

  



  

   

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be required to make payments
based on or determined by reference to the use, utilization or taking into
account of any loss, deduction or other tax item (including the carryforward
thereof) and excluding any commercial agreement the primary subject matter of
which does not relate to Taxes, shall be terminated prior to the Closing, and
after the Closing neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  



  

(f) _Reorganization_. Each of the parties shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Mergers, taken together, to qualify as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the
parties shall (and each of the parties shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to take any action
not contemplated by this Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Mergers, taken together, to fail to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties intend to
report and, except to the extent otherwise required by Law, shall report, for
all tax purposes, the Mergers, taken together, as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

6.18 _Written Consents; Appraisal_. As promptly as practicable after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and without limiting the rights
of Parent pursuant to Section 7.02(e), the Company will deliver to Parent
executed written consents in the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto
adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and the Company's
organizational documents, which written consents shall, at the time of such
delivery, be executed by the Minimum Supporting Holders. Notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, in the event that there are any Appraisal Shares,
the Company shall take such all actions as are necessary to cause the holders
of such Appraisal Shares to waive such rights, including by enforcing any
contractual rights that would require such waivers.

any time prior to the Closing, notwithstanding the approval thereof by the
stockholders of the Company at any time prior to the Closing, as follows:

  



  

(a) at the election of the Company or Parent on or after November 7,
2017 (the " _Outside Date_ "), if the Closing shall not have occurred by 4:00
p.m. New York time on such date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor Parent may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(a)_ if it (or, in the case of Parent, the Merger Subs) is in breach of
any of its obligations hereunder and such breach causes, or results in, either
(i) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the
terminating party set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the Outside Date or (ii)
the failure of the Closing to have occurred prior to the Outside Date;

  



  

(b) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  



  

(c) by the Company or Parent if there shall be in effect a final,
nonappealable Governmental Order or Law, in each case of a Government Entity
having competent jurisdiction over the Company and its Subsidiaries, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.01(c) _ shall not be available to the party seeking to terminate
if a material breach by such party (or, in the case of Parent, the Merger
Subs) of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the issuance of such
nonappealable Governmental Order or Law;

  



  

(d) by Parent if (i) none of Parent or the Merger Subs is in
material breach of any of their respective representations, warranties
or covenants hereunder and (ii) the Company is in breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder that would render any
condition set forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ , _Section 7.02(b)_ or _Section
7.02(c)_ not to be satisfied, and such breach is either (A) not capable of
being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) if curable, is not cured within
the earlier of (x) 20 Business Days after the giving of written notice by
Parent to the Company and (y) two Business Days prior to the Outside Date;

  



  

(e) by the Company if (i) (A) the conditions set forth in _Section
7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ are satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the

  



  

   

 | 74| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Closing but subject to their being capable of being satisfied if the Closing
were to occur on the date of termination), (B) the Company has given notice to
Parent in writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing and (C) Parent or either Merger Sub fails to complete the Closing when
required to in accordance with _Section 2.02_ or (ii) the Company is not in
material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants hereunder and
Parent or the Merger Subs is in breach of any of its respective
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder that would render any
condition set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ , _Section 7.03(b)_ or _Section
7.03(c)_ not to be satisfied, and (in the case of this clause (ii) only) such
breach is either (A) not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or
(B) if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (x) 20 Business Days after
the giving of written notice by the Company to Parent and (y) two Business
Days prior to the Outside Date; or

  



  

(f) by Parent, unless, prior to the opening of trading in the United
States financial markets on the first (1st) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement, the Company has delivered to Parent a written consent
constituting the Stockholder Approval, or if such Stockholder Approval
thereafter does not continue to remain in full force and effect through the
Closing Date.

  



  

8.02 _Procedure Upon Termination_. In the event of termination and
abandonment by the Company or Parent, or both, pursuant to _Section 8.01_ ,
written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, and the
Transactions shall be abandoned, without further action by any of the
Company, Parent or the Merger Subs.

  



  

8.03 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_ , then each of the
parties shall be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this
Agreement and such termination shall be without any liability to the Company,
Parent or the Merger Subs; _provided_ , _however_ , that subject to the terms
of this _Section 8.03_ , no such termination shall relieve any party hereto
from liability for any intentional and material breach prior to
such termination and (ii) the provisions of _Section 6.05_ , _Section 6.06_ ,
the last sentence of _Section 6.08(a)_ ,  _Section 6.11(g)_ , this _Section
8.03_ and _Article X_ shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. For the
avoidance of doubt and without limiting the Company's rights under this
_Section 8.03_ or elsewhere under this Agreement, for all purposes of this
Agreement, the failure of Parent and/or the Merger Subs to consummate the
Closing when required in accordance with _Section 2.02_ , and to make the
payments required by _Article III_ when required, shall be an intentional and
material breach of this Agreement by Parent and the Merger Subs. In the event
of the termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as
provided in _Section 8.01_ : (a) each party, if so requested by any other
party, will return or destroy promptly every document furnished to it by such
other party (or any Affiliate or Representative of such other party) in
connection with the Transactions, whether so obtained before or after the
execution of this Agreement, and any copies thereof (except for copies of
documents publicly available) that may have been made, and will use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives and any Representatives
of financial institutions, financing sources and others to whom such
documents were furnished promptly to return or destroy such documents and any
copies thereof any of them may have made; and (b) the Confidentiality
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and survive the termination of
this Agreement.

_Article IV_.

  



  

(d) Parent, the Merger Subs and their respective Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, subsidiaries, controlling persons, agents
and other Representatives hereby acknowledge that, except for the
representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_, no other
statutory, express or implied representation or warranty, whether written or

10.09 _Company Disclosure Schedule_.

  



  

(a) The Company Disclosure Schedule and the information and
disclosures contained therein relate to and qualify certain of the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations made by the Company in
this Agreement and shall not be construed or otherwise deemed to constitute,
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company or any
other Person except to the extent explicitly provided in the Agreement and
shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of any of such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be construed as an admission or indication, in and of itself, that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance,
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, or that such item or other matter is required to be referred
to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only. No reference in the Company
Disclosure Schedule to any agreement or document, in and of itself, shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such agreement or document is
enforceable or currently in effect or that there are any obligations
remaining to be performed or any rights that may be exercised under such
agreement or document. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule
relating to any possible breach or violation of, or non-compliance with, any
agreement, law or regulation, in and of itself, shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach, violation or non-
compliance exists or has actually occurred, and nothing in the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an admission of any liability or
obligation of any Person to any other Person or shall confer or give any third
party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or any
other right whatsoever. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in the Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply
that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described in the

  



  

   

 | 82| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Agreement or included in the Company Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the
ordinary course of business for purposes of the Agreement. The Company
Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to the Sections in
the Agreement and any items or matters set forth in one section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to and qualify
the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds and each
other Section or subsection of the Agreement to the extent the relevance of
such items or matters to such other Section or subsection of this Agreement
is reasonably apparent on its face. The inclusion of any cross-references to
any Schedules, or the failure to include such cross-references, shall not be
deemed to mean that the relevance of any disclosure is not
reasonably apparent for the purposes of the immediately preceding sentence.
The headings contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule are included for
convenience and reference only, and are not intended to limit the effect of
the disclosures contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule or to expand,
modify or influence the scope of the information required to be disclosed in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The information contained in the Company Disclosure Schedule is
confidential, proprietary information of the Company, and Parent and the
Merger Subs shall be obligated to maintain and protect such confidential
information pursuant to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement. In
disclosing the information in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company
expressly does not waive any attorney-client privilege or other similar
privilege associated with such information or any protection afforded by the
work-product doctrine or other similar doctrine with respect to any of the
matters disclosed or discussed herein.

  



  

10.10 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented only by a mutual written agreement executed
and delivered by the Company (with the consent of the Securityholder
Representative) and Parent. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any failure of any party to comply with any obligation, covenant or condition
herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a
written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver
or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.10_ , no amendment or modification
to any of _Section 10.02(c)_ , the first sentence of _Section 10.03,_ this
sentence of this _Section 10.10_ , the proviso of the second sentence of
_Section 10.12_ or _Section 10.13(b)_ that is adverse to the
Financing Sources shall become effective without the prior written consent of
the adversely affected Financing Sources.

  



  

10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, including by means of facsimile or email in Portable Document
Format, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement
and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and
the same agreement.

  



  

10.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns
except (a) as set forth in _Section 6.09_ , _Section 10.15_ and _Section
10.16_ , (b) for the right of the Company on behalf of the Equity Holders to
pursue damages (including claims for damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the Merger, including _Article III_ , to the Equity Holders) in
the event the Closing has not occurred as a result

  



  

   

 | 83| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

of Parent's or a Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement, or (c) after the
Effective Time, if Parent shall not have made payments in accordance with
_Article III_, the right of the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of
each Equity Holder) to enforce directly the Equity Holders' right to
receive the amounts payable pursuant to _Article III_. Nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of
employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ that the provisions of _Section 10.02(c)_ , the first sentence of
_Section 10.03,_ the third sentence in _Section 10.10_ , this proviso of this
_Section 10.12_ and _Section 10.13(b)_ , in each case, pertaining to the
Financing Sources, are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Financing Sources.

  



  

10.13 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) Immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would occur for
which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, if for any
reason the Company, Parent or any Merger Sub shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, if the Closing has occurred, any
failure to perform or breach for which the parties have no liability under
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.01(d)_ ), then
the party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming party
shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate
injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this
being in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

(b) No Financing Source will have any liability to the Company, any
of its Affiliates, Representatives or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
in their capacities as such), relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
any Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and no such Person will have any rights or claims against
any Financing Source or be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against any Financing Source (such
Financing Sources being express third party beneficiaries of this sentence).
No Financing Source shall be subject to any indirect, special, punitive or
consequential damages or damages of a tortious nature in connection with the
Debt Financing.

  



  

10.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof.

  



  

10.15 _Securityholder Representative_.

  



  

(a) Pursuant to the adoption of this Agreement by Company Common
Stockholders representing greater than 50% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common

  



  

   

 | 84| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Stock, each Equity Holder will be deemed to have irrevocably appointed,
authorized and empowered the Securityholder Representative to act as a
representative for the benefit of each Equity Holder as the exclusive agent
and attorney-in-fact with the power and authority to act on behalf of each
Equity Holder in connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the
Transactions (including the Initial Merger and the Follow-On Merger), which
shall include the power and authority as is necessary to carry out the
functions assigned to the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
obligation to the Equity Holders to act except as expressly provided herein,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Securityholder
Representative shall have the power and authority:

  



  

(i) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection
with this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the
consummation of the Initial Merger and the Follow-On Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Securityholder
Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable,
including any amendments or modifications to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements;

  



  

(ii) to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Equity
Holders and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of
the Securityholder Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the other
agreements contemplated hereby and thereby or the Mergers and other
transactions provided for herein or therein, and to take any and all actions
which the Securityholder Representative believes are necessary or appropriate
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements for and on behalf of
the Equity Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Securityholder Representative may (A) assert any claim or institute any
Action, (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any Action initiated by
Parent or any other Person, or by any Governmental Entity against the
Securityholder Representative or any of the Equity Holders, (C) receive
process on behalf of any or all Equity Holders in any such Action and
compromise or settle on such terms as it shall determine to be appropriate,
and give receipts, releases and discharges with respect to, any such Action,
(D) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as it may deem advisable or
necessary, and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or
award rendered in any such Action (it being understood that the Securityholder
Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and
shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions);

  



  

(iii) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Equity Holders
arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this Agreement or the
other documents contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
failure to act on the part of the Securityholder Representative, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements,
shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Securityholder
Representative or by the Equity Holders unless such waiver is in writing
signed by the waiving party or by the Securityholder Representative;

  



  

   

 | 85| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iv) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other
agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices,
requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other
writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all
action that the Securityholder Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with
or to carry out the Initial Merger and the Follow-On Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, and all other agreements, documents or instruments referred to
herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith;

  



  

(v) to give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection
with any claims under this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements,
including service of process in connection with any arbitration;

  



  

(vi) to determine whether to deliver a Notice of Disagreement and to
resolve any disputes regarding the Closing Statement; and

  



  

(vii) to make or receive any payments or to pay any expenses under or
in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements or on
behalf of the Equity Holders, including by using the Securityholder
Representative Expense Amount (and any interest or earnings thereon) to
satisfy costs, expenses and/or liabilities of the Securityholder
Representative in connection with matters related to this Agreement or the
other Transaction Agreements, with any balance of the Securityholder
Representative Expense Amount not used for such purposes to be disbursed and
paid, at such time as the Securityholder Representative determines, in its
sole discretion, that no additional such costs, expenses or liabilities shall
become due and payable, to the Equity Holders in accordance with  _Section
3.06(e)_ , which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be prior to the
determination of the Final Merger Consideration.

  



  

(b) Parent and the Merger Subs may rely upon all actions taken or
omitted to be taken by the Securityholder Representative pursuant to
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements (including any
instructions with respect to the allocation or payment of any
consideration payable to the Equity Holders or former Equity Holders
hereunder), all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding upon
the Equity Holders.

  



  

(c) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Equity Holder and (ii) shall
survive the consummation of the Mergers and other transactions contemplated
hereby and by the other Transaction Agreements.

  



  

(d) All actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall be binding upon all
Equity Holders and their respective successors and assigns as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them. Parent shall serve notice
to, and deal exclusively with, the Securityholder Representative with respect
to any and all matters concerning any of the Equity Holders arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements and all other

  



  

   

 | 86| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

agreements or instruments contemplated hereby or thereby or the Mergers and
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, unless otherwise
instructed by the Securityholder Representative, and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document purported by the Securityholder Representative to have been
executed by or on behalf of any of the Equity Holders as fully binding upon
them. If the Securityholder Representative shall resign, dissolve, cease to
exist or otherwise be unable to fulfill its responsibilities as representative
of the Equity Holders, the Equity Holders shall, within 10 days after the
occurrence of such event, appoint (by majority vote or written consent of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock) a successor representative and,
promptly thereafter, shall notify the Equity Holders and Parent of
the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed to the
rights and obligations of the Securityholder Representative as representative
of the Equity Holders hereunder. If for any reason there is no Securityholder
Representative at any time, all references herein or in any other agreement
or instrument contemplated hereby to the Securityholder Representative in
which the Securityholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Equity Holders shall be deemed to refer to the Equity Holders. Each Equity
Holder upon the execution of a Letter of Transmittal, agrees that any action
taken by the Securityholder Representative on its behalf pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the other
agreements and instruments contemplated hereby and thereby, including all
actions and inactions permitted by this _Section 10.15_ , shall be fully
binding on them.

  



  

(e) By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal, each Equity Holder
irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
liability to any Equity Holder with respect to actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative and that the
Securityholder Representative shall be under no obligation to take any action
in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative, unless the
Securityholder Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in the sole determination of Securityholder
Representative, are sufficient to protect the Securityholder
Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be
incurred by the Securityholder Representative in responding to such
direction or taking such action. By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal,
each Equity Holder irrevocably shall agree that the
Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Securityholder
Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and
advice of such persons. By the execution of a Letter of Transmittal, each
Equity Holder irrevocably shall agree that the Securityholder Representative
shall be entitled to indemnification from the Equity Holders against any
loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be
taken in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative (except for those
arising out of Securityholder Representative's gross negligence or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. The Equity Holders will indemnify the Securityholder Representative
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence on a pro rata basis
based on their respective equity interest in the Company as of immediately
prior to the Closing.

  



  

   

 | 87| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) The parties acknowledge that the Securityholder Representative's
obligations under this _Section 10.15_ are solely as a representative of the
Equity Holders and that the Securityholder Representative shall have no
personal responsibility or liability for any expenses, costs or other
liabilities incurred by it in such capacity.

  



  

10.16 _No Recourse_. Except pursuant to the Letters of Transmittal,
notwithstanding anything else that may be expressed or implied in this
Agreement or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith, by
its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, each party covenants,
agrees and acknowledges that no Persons other than the parties hereto have any
liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether
contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the
Equity Holders of the Company or their respective managing members or general
partners may be partnerships or limited liability companies, no party has any
right of recovery under this Agreement, or any claim based on such
liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and no personal liability
shall attach to, the former, current or future equity holders, controlling
persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers or general or limited partners of any party or any former, current or
future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general
or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate or agent of any of the
foregoing (collectively, but not including the parties hereto, each a " _Non-
Recourse Party_ "), through a party hereto or otherwise, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or
on behalf of a party hereto against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or Law, or otherwise.

  



  

10.17 _Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
equityholders, partners, managers, members, officers, employees and
Affiliates, (a) that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (the " _Retained Counsel_ ") has
been retained by, and may serve as counsel to, each and any of the
Securityholder Representative, the Equity Holders and their respective
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) (individually and
collectively, the " _Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the Transactions, (b) that the Retained Counsel has not acted
as counsel for any other party hereto in connection with the Transactions and
that none of the other parties hereto has the status of a client of the
Retained Counsel for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result
thereof, and (c) that, following consummation of the Transactions, the
Retained Counsel (or any of its respective successors) may serve as counsel
to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, manager, officer,
employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in connection with
any litigation, action, suit, claim, investigation, proceeding or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the parties hereto (on their own
behalf and on behalf of their Affiliates) hereby consents thereto and
knowingly, willingly and irrevocably waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. The Company, Parent and the Seller Group hereby agree that, in the
event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, the
Company and/or their Subsidiaries on the one hand, and the Seller Group or
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, the Retained Counsel may
represent the Seller Group, and/or such Affiliates in such dispute even though
the interests of the Seller Group and/or such

  



  

   

 | 88| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Affiliates may be directly adverse to Parent, the Company or their
Subsidiaries, and even though the Retained Counsel may have represented the
Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for Parent, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent agrees that (x) all communications among
any member of the Seller Group, the Company and its Subsidiaries (as to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, with respect to pre-Closing communications
only), any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or
Representatives, and the Retained Counsel that relate in any way with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute arising in connection with, this Agreement, or otherwise relating to
any potential sale of the Company or the Transactions (the "
_Protected Seller Communications_ "), will be deemed to be privileged and
confidential communications, (y) all rights to such Protected Seller
Communications, the expectation of client confidentiality, and the control of
the confidentiality and privilege applicable thereto, belong to and will be
retained by the Seller Group, and (z) to the extent Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing)
should discover in its possession after the Closing any Protected Seller
Communications, it will take reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality
thereof and promptly deliver the same to the Securityholder Representative,
keeping no copies, and will not by reason thereof assert any loss of
confidentiality or privilege protection. As to any such Protected Seller
Communications prior to the Closing Date, Parent, the Company, and each of
their Subsidiaries together with any of their respective affiliates,
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, further agree that none of the
foregoing may use or rely on any of the Protected Seller Communications in
any action against or involving any of the Seller Group or the Retained
Counsel after the Closing. The Protected Seller Communications may be used by
the Seller Group and/or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with
any dispute that relates in any way to this Agreement or the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates and a third party after the
Closing, Parent may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by counsel for Parent to such third
party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative. Parent and the Merger Subs knowingly,
willingly, irrevocably and expressly acknowledge and agree, on their own
behalf, that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.17_ (i) require
performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and will survive the Closing for twenty (20) years and will not be
subject to any of the survival provisions of _Section 9.01(d)_ and (ii) are an
integral part of the Transactions and that, without the agreements set forth
in this _Section 10.17_ , the Company would not enter into this Agreement or
recommend approval of this Agreement to the Company Common Stockholders.
