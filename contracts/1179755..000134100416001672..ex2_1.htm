108(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act and (c) cause to be included in the Merger
Application a request that the Registrar issue the certificate of merger with
respect to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") on the Closing Date at the

the Merger Application. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance of
the Certificate of Merger by the Registrar or such other date as the
Certificate of Merger shall provide. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
that they will request that the Registrar provide in the Certificate of Merger
that the effective date of the Merger be the Closing Date (the "Effective
Time").

  

  

SECTION 1.03 Effects of Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 109(2) of the
Bermuda Companies Act.

  

  

SECTION 1.04 Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of the Surviving Company.
At the Effective Time, the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the
Surviving Company shall be in the form of the memorandum of association and
bye-laws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or pursuant to applicable
Law (in each case, subject to Section 5.08 hereof).

  

  

SECTION 1.05 Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Company. The
directors of Merger Sub in office immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Company until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case
may be.

  

  

SECTION 1.06 Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Conyers Dill and Pearman Limited, Clarendon House, 2
Church Street, Hamilton, Bermuda at 10:00 a.m., Bermuda time, on a date to be
specified by the Company and Parent, which date shall be as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in any event no later than the fifth business day) following
the satisfaction or (to the extent

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

permitted by applicable Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver of those conditions at such time), or at such other place, time and

Date."

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Share Capital. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the occurrence of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any ordinary shares, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Shares") or any ordinary shares, par
value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Shares"):

  

  

(a) Share Capital of Merger Sub. Each Merger Sub Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
canceled and converted into and become one (1) duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary share, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Surviving Company (the "Surviving Company Shares").

  

  

(b) Cancelation of Treasury Shares; Treatment of Shares Held by Company
Subsidiaries. All Company Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury
shares shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be canceled automatically and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Company Share, if
any, owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
shall not represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and shall
instead convert into one (1) Surviving Company Share.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Shares. Subject to Section 2.01(b) and Section 2.04,
each Company Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and converted into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive $93.00 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration"). Subject to Section 2.04, as of the Effective
Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate previously evidencing any Company Shares (each, a "Certificate")
or uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (each, a "Book-
Entry Share") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, to be paid
in consideration therefor, in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

  

  

(d) Company Preferred Shares. Subject to Section 2.04, each 6.35% non-
cumulative preferred share, Series C of the Company ("Company Preferred
Share") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall remain issued and outstanding as a preferred share of the Surviving
Company and shall be entitled to the same dividend and all other preferences
and privileges, voting rights, relative, participating, optional and other
special rights, and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

qualifications, limitations and restrictions set forth in the certificate of
designations ("Certificate of Designations") applicable to the Company
Preferred Shares, which Certificate of Designations shall remain at and
following the Effective Time in full force and effect as an obligation of the
Surviving Company in accordance with Section 109(2) of the Bermuda Companies
Act.

  

  

SECTION 2.02 Exchange Fund. (a) At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment and delivery of the aggregate
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection
therewith, shall at or prior to the Closing Date enter into an agreement with
the Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article II (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). Pending its disbursement in accordance
with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United
States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and
credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment
of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's
Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements
or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5 billion.
Any and all interest earned on the funds in the Exchange Fund shall be paid by
the Paying Agent to Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of
the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any
former holder of Company Shares to receive the Merger Consideration such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II.

  

  

(b) Letter of Transmittal; Exchange of Certificates. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time (but in no event later than three (3) business days
after the Effective Time), the Surviving Company or Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and have such other
customary provisions as the Surviving Company may specify, subject to the
Company's reasonable approval (to be sought prior to the Effective Time)),
together with instructions thereto, setting forth, inter alia, the procedures
by which holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may receive the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
holders of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
but may, if required by the Paying Agent, be required to deliver an executed
letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive the Merger
Consideration such holder is entitled to pursuant to this Article II. Upon the
completion of such applicable procedures by a holder and the surrender of such
holder's Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the Paying Agent shall deliver to
such holder the Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Article II, and such surrendered Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Certificate
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment (1) shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder or (2)
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Company
that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until satisfaction of
the applicable procedures

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

contemplated by this Section 2.02 and subject to Section 2.04, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as contemplated by this Article II. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article II.

  

  

(c) Share Register; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of each Company Share upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article
II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Company Shares previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to (i) Section 2.04 and (ii) the
Surviving Company's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have
been declared by the Company on Company Shares not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the share register of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the share register of the Surviving Company of Company Shares
that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares formerly
represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such underlying
Company Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.02(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Company, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to be paid in respect
of the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated
by this Article II.

  

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time following the first anniversary
of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which has not been disbursed to former holders of Company
Shares, and thereafter such former holders shall be entitled to look only to
Parent and the Surviving Company for, and Parent and the Surviving Company
shall remain liable to the extent required by applicable Law for, payment of
their claims of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions pertaining to their former Company Shares that such former
holders have the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall become, immediately prior to such time, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or its designee, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Taxes. Parent, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required or permitted to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code"), or under any provision of other applicable Tax or other Laws and
Parent or the Surviving Company shall make any required filings with and
payments to the appropriate Governmental Authorities relating to such
deduction or withholding. To the extent amounts are so withheld by Parent or
the Surviving Company and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to or on behalf of the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

SECTION 2.03 Company Equity Awards. (a) Each option granted by the Company
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested or exercisable) that represents the right to
acquire Company Shares (each, an "Option") shall at the Effective Time vest in
full and be canceled, terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Option Consideration for each
Company Share then subject to the Option. The Option Consideration shall be
paid by the Surviving Company as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, but in no event later than the first payroll cycle of the Surviving
Company which follows the Effective Time, unless such payroll cycle occurs
within three (3) business days after the Effective Time, in which case the
Surviving Company shall pay the Option Consideration as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, but in no event later than the second payroll
cycle of the Surviving Company following the Effective Time. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Option Consideration" means, with respect to any Company
Share issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the exercise price payable in
respect of such Company Share issuable under such Option.

  

  

(b) Each Company Share that is then subject to a risk of forfeiture (each, a
"Restricted Share") and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, vest in full, in the case of a
time based vesting Restricted Share ("Time-Based Restricted Share"), or vest
at the vesting percentage that is obtained by applying the relative TSR at the
time of Closing (as determined on the basis of the Merger Consideration) to
the TSR Percentile Rank table and vesting percentage formula in the applicable
award agreements, in the case of a performance based vesting Restricted Share
("Performance-Based Restricted Share"), and shall be converted, to the extent
vested after giving effect to this sentence, at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest from the Surviving
Company as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event
later than the first payroll cycle of the Surviving Company which follows the
Effective Time, unless such payroll cycle occurs within three (3) business
days after the Effective Time, in which case the Surviving Company shall pay
the Merger Consideration as soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
but in no event later than the second payroll cycle of the Surviving Company
following the Effective Time. Any Performance-Based Restricted Share that does
not vest at the Effective Time in accordance with this Section 2.03(b) shall
be forfeited automatically without payment therefor.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding right, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Company Shares or benefits measured by the value of Company
Shares ("RSU"), shall vest in full and be converted into a right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of Company Shares
subject to such RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time times (ii) the
Merger Consideration (the "RSU Consideration"). The RSU Consideration shall be
paid by the Surviving Company as soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, but in no event later than the first payroll cycle of the Surviving
Company which follows the Effective Time, unless such payroll cycle occurs
within three (3) business days after the Effective Time, in which case the
Surviving Company shall pay the RSU Consideration as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time, but in no event later than the second payroll
cycle of the Surviving Company following the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) The Surviving Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.03 to any holder of
Options, Restricted Shares and RSUs such amount as the Surviving Company is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of other applicable Tax or other Laws, and
the Surviving Company shall make any required filings with and payments to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities relating to any such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the
Surviving Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to or on behalf of the holder of such
Options, Restricted Shares or RSUs, as applicable, in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company.

  

  

(e) Company ESPP. With respect to the ESPP, (i) participation in the ESPP
shall be limited to those individuals who are participants in the ESPP on the
date of this Agreement; (ii) no new Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP),
other than the Purchase Period in effect as of the date of this Agreement,
shall be authorized, continued or commenced on or after the date of this
Agreement; (iii) participants in the ESPP may not increase their payroll
deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement; (iv) any holding period relating to Company Shares received in
respect of the ESPP shall be waived as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time; and (v) the ESPP shall be suspended on January 1, 2017 and terminate
effective as of the Effective Time.

  

  

(f) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take any such actions with respect to the Company
Share Plans as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Section 2.03.

  

  

SECTION 2.04 Shares of Dissenting Holders. (a) At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, converted into the right to receive, with respect to Company
Shares, the Merger Consideration or, with respect to Company Preferred Shares,
the preferred shares of the Surviving Company as described in Section 2.01(d),
and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event that the fair value of
a Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court of Bermuda under Section
106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the "Appraised Fair Value") is greater
than, with respect to Company Shares, the Merger Consideration or, with
respect to Company Preferred Shares, the value of their preferred shares of
the Surviving Company as described in Section 2.01(d), be entitled to receive
such difference from the Surviving Company by payment made within thirty (30)
days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such
appraisal procedure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) In the event that a holder fails to exercise, effectively withdraws or
otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an "Appraisal Withdrawal") such
holder's Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive, with respect to Company Shares, the Merger
Consideration or, with respect to Company Preferred Shares, the preferred
shares of the Surviving Company as described in Section 2.01(d), for each such
Dissenting Share.

  

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares, Appraisal Withdrawals and any other
instruments, notices, petitions or other written communication received by the
Company in accordance with this Section 2.04 and (B) to the extent that the
Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with
the Company in any settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
demands for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, offer to settle or settle any such demands or applications, or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely
take any other action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the
Bermuda Companies Act. Payment of any amount payable to holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be the obligation of the Surviving Company.

  

  

SECTION 2.05 Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction.

Schedule") (it being understood that any information set forth on one section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to apply to
and qualify the section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure
that such information is relevant to such other section or subsection) or (B)
disclosed in any report, schedule, form, statement or other document (i) filed
with, or furnished to, the SEC since January 1, 2015 by the Company and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Company Filed SEC
Documents") or (ii) solely with respect to representations and warranties
relating to Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., a Bermuda exempted limited
liability company ("BCRH"), or any of its Subsidiaries, filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC by BCRH since January 1, 2015 and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement, in the case of each of the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii), other than disclosure contained in the "Risk Factors" or

in which the Company or BCRH operates without disclosure of specific facts and
circumstances:

  

  

SECTION 3.01 Organization; Standing. (a) The Company is an exempted company
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
Bermuda. The Company has all requisite power and authority necessary to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its
assets and properties, except (other than with respect to the due
incorporation and valid existence of the Company) as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. A true and
complete copy of each of the Company Organizational Documents is included in
the Company Filed SEC Documents. The Company is not in violation of the
Company Organizational Documents and no Subsidiary of the Company is in
violation of any of its organizational documents, except as would not be
material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  

  

(b) Each of the Company's Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except as would not be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  

  

SECTION 3.02 Capitalization. (a) The authorized share capital of the Company
consists of 120,000,000 Company Shares and 9,200 preferred shares, par value
$1.00 per share. At the close of business on September 30, 2016 (the
"Capitalization Date"), (i) 67,594,088 Company Shares (excluding any treasury

Shares (of which 133,672 are subject to performance-based vesting), and 9,200
Company Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding, (ii) 21,803,223 Company
Shares were held by the Company as treasury shares, (iii) 160,000 Company
Shares were issuable in respect of outstanding Options (other than Options
outstanding under the ESPP) and (iv) 111,326 Company Shares were issuable in
respect of outstanding RSUs. Since the Capitalization Date through the date of
this Agreement, other than in connection with the exercise of Options or the
vesting or settlement of RSUs in accordance with their terms, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (1) issued any Company Securities or
incurred any obligation to make any payments based on the price or value of
any Company Securities or dividends paid thereon that were outstanding as of
the Capitalization Date, other than dividend equivalents with respect to RSUs,
or (2) established a record date for, declared, set aside for payment or paid
any dividend on, or made any other distribution in respect of, any shares of
the Company's share capital. Section 3.02(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of the Capitalization
Date, on a grant-by-grant basis, of the following information: the number of
Company Shares subject to any outstanding Options, the number of Company
Shares outstanding in the form of, respectively, Time-Based Restricted Shares
and Performance-Based Restricted Shares (separately indicating the target and

there were (i) no outstanding shares or other equity or voting interests in,
the Company, (ii) no outstanding securities of the Company convertible into or
exchangeable for shares or other equity or voting interests in, the Company,

or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable
security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to any shares or
other equity or voting interests in, the Company (the items in clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv) being referred to collectively as "Company Securities")
and (v) no other obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make
any payments based on the price or value of any Company Securities or
dividends paid thereon. Other than the RSUs, there are no outstanding
agreements or instruments of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities
(or obligate the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such agreements
relating to any Company Securities) or that grant any preemptive rights,
subscription rights, anti-dilutive rights, rights of first refusal or similar
rights with respect to any Company Securities. Except as described in this
Section 3.02, no direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company
Shares. None of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any
shareholders' agreement, voting trust agreement, registration rights agreement
or other similar agreement or understanding relating to any Company Securities
or any other agreement relating to the disposition, voting or dividends with
respect to any Company Securities. No holder of securities in the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any right to have such securities registered by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All outstanding Company Shares and
Company Preferred Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

  

  

(c) The Company Shares and the Company Preferred Shares constitute the only
issued and outstanding classes of securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the
"Exchange Act").

  

  

(d) Section 3.02(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of organization of each
Subsidiary of the Company. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (except
for non-voting redeemable preference shares, directors' qualifying shares or
the like) are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, by
the Company free and clear of all Liens and material transfer restrictions,
except for such Liens and transfer restrictions of general applicability as
may be provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Securities Act"),
other applicable securities Laws (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such shares of capital stock or other
equity or voting interests) or applicable Insurance Laws. Each outstanding
share of capital stock of each Subsidiary of the Company that is held,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, is duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and there are no
subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts or other
commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to the

stock or other equity or voting interests of any Subsidiary of the Company,
including any right of conversion or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or agreement, any
agreements granting any preemptive rights, subscription rights, anti-dilutive
rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights with respect to any
securities of any Subsidiary of the Company other than as required by
applicable Law. None of the Subsidiaries of the Company has any outstanding
equity compensation plans relating to the capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company.

  

  

(e) Section 3.02(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the

restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities
Act, other applicable securities Laws or applicable Insurance Laws.

connection with, the Transactions), (i) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or

compensation or any other payment, (iii) cause the Company to transfer or set
aside any assets to fund any benefits under any Company Plan or (iv) limit or
restrict the right to amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any Company
Plan on or following the Effective Time. The consummation of the Transactions

payment (or acceleration of vesting) of any amounts of benefits that will be

provided that Parent may make any such request only once in any ten (10) day
period (each, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or

  

  

(v) enter into or publicly propose to enter into any letter of intent,
agreement or agreement in principle with respect to a Takeover Proposal (an

Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, (1) the Company
and its Representatives may contact any Person making a Takeover Proposal
delivered to the Company after the date of this Agreement and that did not
result from any breach of this Section 5.02 solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof, to request that any Takeover Proposal made orally be made
in writing and to negotiate an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (2)
subject to the Company's compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.02,
including (in the case of a Takeover Proposal) the execution and delivery of
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the Company and its Representatives
and the Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona
fide written Takeover Proposal that was delivered to the Company after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this Section 5.02
or, in the case of clause (iii), in response to a Company Intervening Event,
take the actions set forth in this Section 5.02(c):

  

  

(i) engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person (and its
Representatives) who has made such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover
Proposal, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines (A) in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the directors of the Company under Bermuda Law;

  

  

(ii) furnish or disclose any information relating to or in the possession of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives), if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines (A) in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the
Company under Bermuda Law, but only so long as the Company has caused such
Person to enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided that
all such information (other than non-intentional, immaterial omissions
therefrom) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; or

  

  

(iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in connection with terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii), enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval if
(A) in the case of a Takeover Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines (1) in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
directors of the Company under Bermuda Law; provided, however, that (y) the
Board of Directors of the Company shall not make such an Adverse
Recommendation Change or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement until
after the fifth business day following Parent's receipt of written notice (a
"Notice of Superior Proposal") from the Company advising Parent that the Board
of Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
that

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors of the Company
(it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a
new five (5) business day period) and (z) during such period following
Parent's receipt of a Notice of Superior Proposal, in determining whether to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, (I) the Company shall have offered to negotiate with (and, if
accepted, shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have,
negotiated in good faith with) Parent and its Representatives with respect to
any revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent
as would cause the Takeover Proposal to no longer be a Superior Proposal and
(II) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined, after
considering the results of such negotiations and the revised proposals made by
Parent, if any, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to such Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal; or (B) a Company
Intervening Event has occurred and the Board of Directors of the Company
determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
directors of the Company under Bermuda Law; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors of the Company shall not make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement until after the
second business day following Parent's receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to
take such action, and specifying the reasons therefor.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, the actions permitted by this Section 5.02(c) may
be taken only in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was
delivered to the Company after the date of this Agreement and that did not
result from any breach of this Section 5.02, or to a Company Intervening
Event, and not for any other reason.

  

  

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by, or communication to, the Company or
its Representatives) upon receipt of any Takeover Proposal or inquiry,
indication, proposal or offer by any Person that would reasonably be expected
to result in a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly
with the identity of such Person, a description of the terms of such Takeover
Proposal, inquiry, indication, proposal or offer, and provide to Parent
promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by,
or communication to, the Company or its Representatives) unredacted copies of
all material correspondence or other material written documentation with
respect thereto (and written summaries of any material oral communications).
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the
status of any such Takeover Proposal, inquiry, indication, proposal or offer.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be permitted to (i) disclose to the
shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule
14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act and (ii) make
such other public disclosure if it determines, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the directors of the Company under Bermuda Law; it being
understood, however, that this Section 5.02(e) shall not be deemed to permit
the Board of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or take any of the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

actions referred to in clause (iii) of Section 5.02(c) except, in each case,
to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.02(c). Any public disclosure by
the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof
relating to a Takeover Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Board of Directors of the Company, unless the
Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
in such disclosure.

  

  

SECTION 5.03 Preparation of the Prospectus; Shareholders Meeting. (a) The
Company shall prepare and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a mutually
acceptable proxy statement relating to the matters to be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting (such proxy
statement, including any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy
Statement"). The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
prepare and file the Proxy Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement (and, in any event, within forty-five
(45) days following the date of this Agreement subject to the receipt from
Parent of any information required to complete the Proxy Statement that is
requested by the Company in writing). In addition, the Company shall:

  

  

(i) use reasonable best efforts to respond to comments received from the SEC
on the Proxy Statement and to mail the Proxy Statement to its shareholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC or its staff advises that it
has no further comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company may
commence mailing of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of
any written comments and advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC on or after the date of this
Agreement;

  

  

(ii) provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the
SEC with respect to the filings made on or after the date of this Agreement,
and the Company will provide Parent with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the times of the meeting
of shareholders to be held in connection with the Transactions, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, that, the Company shall not be responsible or liable for
any statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein;

  

  

(iii) cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder, except that no representation or warranty shall be made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) use reasonable best efforts to take any action required to be taken under
any applicable securities Laws in connection with the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital
stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action;

  

  

(v) advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request
by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement; and

  

  

(vi) promptly notify Parent (and Parent shall promptly notify the Company) if
at any time prior to the Effective Time it discovers any information relating
to either of the parties, or their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of the Company, to the extent required by Law.

  

  

(b) The Company shall take all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval (the "Company Shareholders Meeting"), as
promptly as practicable after the SEC or its staff advises that it has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 5.02(c)(iii), (i) the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and secure the Company
Shareholder Approval in accordance with applicable legal requirements and (ii)
the Board of Directors of the Company shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

  

  

(c) The Company hereby acknowledges that, pursuant to the Voting Agreement,
each of the shareholders of the Company party thereto has irrevocably granted
to and appointed Parent and up to two (2) of Parent's designated
representatives as such shareholder's proxy to vote all of the Company Shares
(subject to the limitations on voting rights set forth in Section 63 of the
Company Bye-Laws) held by such shareholder at the Company Shareholders
Meeting, solely on the matters and in the manner specified in such Voting
Agreement. The Company further agrees that during the Voting Period (as
defined in the Voting Agreement), it shall recognize the grant of any such
proxy and the exercise thereof by Parent or one of its designated
representatives in accordance with the terms thereof at any meeting of the
shareholders of the Company (including the Company Shareholders Meeting and
any adjournment, reconvenement or postponement thereof), subject to applicable
Law. The Company shall implement the voting cutback provisions of 63 of the
Company Bye-Laws consistent with past practice in connection with the
determination of the Company Shareholder Approval.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn, recess, reconvene or postpone the Company Shareholders
Meeting, (i) after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure
that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to the shareholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting, or (ii) after consultation with
Parent, if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

insufficient Company Shares present (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting.

is expressly provided for herein) to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the

that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, including any such approvals, consents, registrations, waivers,
permits, authorizations, orders, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods and other confirmations required with respect to the Company Insurance
Approvals, the Parent Insurance Approvals and under applicable Antitrust Laws,
(iii) take all steps that are necessary, proper or advisable to avoid any
Actions by any Governmental Authorities with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions and (iv) defend or contest in good faith any Action by any third
party (excluding any Governmental Authority), whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or that would otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Transactions; provided, that nothing
in this Section 5.04 or otherwise in this Agreement or the Statutory Merger
Agreement shall require (and reasonable best efforts or commercially
reasonable efforts shall in no event require) Parent or any of its Affiliates
to (x) litigate any denial, non-approval or rejection of any Required
Regulatory Approvals issued or determined by any Governmental Authority or (y)
take or refrain from or to agree to the taking or refraining from any action
(including any amendment, waiver or termination of any agreement, including
this Agreement) or to permit or suffer to exist any restriction, condition,
limitation or requirement that would or would reasonably be expected to
result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Burdensome Condition; provided,
further, that without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company and its
Affiliates shall not take or refrain from, or agree to the taking or
refraining from, any action (including any amendment, waiver or termination of
any agreement, including this Agreement) or to permit or suffer to exist any
restriction, condition, limitation or requirement that would or would
reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Burdensome Condition.

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action
necessary to ensure that no Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the Transactions and refrain from taking any actions that would cause the
applicability of such Laws and (ii) if the restrictions of any Takeover Law
become applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary to
ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise lawfully minimize the effect of
such Takeover Law on the Transactions.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the general applicability of Section 5.04(a), each of the
Company and Parent shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other, and
subject to (i) the receipt from the other of all the information concerning it
and its business as may be required to complete an application or filing that
is requested by the filing party in writing and (ii) any supplemental
information requested to be included in a filing by a Governmental Authority
in connection with such filing (x) promptly following the date of this
Agreement (and, in any event, within forty-five (45) days following the date
of this Agreement), file all required approval applications to, and
notification filings with, (A) the United States Federal Trade Commission and

approval applications to, and notification filings with any other Governmental
Authority in relation to any other Required Regulatory Approval (other than
with respect to the applications and notifications with respect to the PRA,
FCA, Lloyd's and JFSA which shall be made in accordance with the terms of
clause (y)(B) and (z) below, respectively), (B) advanced drafts of all
required approval applications to, and notification filings with, the PRA, FCA
and Lloyd's and (C) file all biographical affidavits (including fingerprint
cards) contemplated by clause (x)(B) above to the extent not previously filed,

for the Company following the Closing, (B) prepare necessary filings for
submission with the JFSA and consult with the JFSA regarding such filings and
(C) formally submit filings in form and content reasonably acceptable to the
JFSA following discussions with the JFSA. Any such filings shall be in
material compliance with the requirements of applicable Law. Parent and Merger
Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, at any time
prior to the Closing, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, file or submit any application with or request for non-disapproval
by any Governmental Authority with respect to any inter-affiliate transaction
or agreement between any Company Reinsurance Subsidiary, on the one hand, and
Parent or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, that would require
approval or non-disapproval under applicable Law.

  

  

(d) Each of the parties shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in
Section 5.04(a), (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with its
preparation of any documents, forms, filings or submissions contemplated by
the first sentence of Section 5.04(c), (ii) give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or requests for
additional information from, any Governmental Authority regarding the
Transactions, and permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the
other party in connection with, any such filings, submissions, communications,
inquiries or requests, (iii) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority, and to the extent reasonably practicable,
(A) not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of the Transactions
without providing the other party with

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the reasonable opportunity to participate in such meeting or substantive
conversation, (B) give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such
meeting or substantive conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited
by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority from
participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
substantive conversation, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or such
Governmental Authority, keep such party apprised with respect thereto, (D)
cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings,
correspondence or other written communications explaining or defending this
Agreement or any of the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Authority and (E) furnish the other party with copies of all
substantive filings, submissions, correspondence and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of any Governmental Authority's staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions and (iv) comply with any
inquiry or request from any Governmental Authority as promptly as reasonably
practicable, with respect to all Required Regulatory Approvals, this Agreement
and the Transactions. Each party may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other party as "Outside Counsel Only Material," and also may redact the
material as necessary to (v) remove personally sensitive information, (w)
remove references concerning valuation, (x) comply with contractual
arrangements existing on the date hereof, (y) address bona fide legal
privilege or (z) comply with applicable Law. The parties agree not to extend,
directly or indirectly, any waiting period under any applicable Antitrust Law,
any notification or filing procedure or enter into any agreement with a
Governmental Authority to delay in any material respect or not to consummate
the Merger or any of the other Transactions, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed in the context of seeking such a delay. Parent shall be
entitled to control and lead all communications and strategy with any
Governmental Authority regarding antitrust matters and to direct the antitrust
defense of the Transactions; provided, however, that in all instances relating
to such strategy and communications, Parent shall consult with the Company in
advance and consider in good faith the views of the Company.

  

  

SECTION 5.05 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, real estate transfer, documentary,
stamp, recording, sales, use and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving
Company and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent in preparing, executing and filing any applicable Tax
Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

  

  

SECTION 5.06 Public Announcements; Other Communications. Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Transactions, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or
the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system and except for any matters referred to in Section
5.02 with respect to the Company. The parties hereto agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions following
execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the
parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall have no consultation or other obligation pursuant to this Section 5.06
with respect to any press release or other public statements related to any
actual or contemplated litigation between or among the parties to this
Agreement. The Company will consult with Parent prior to making any
substantive internal announcements or other substantive communications to its
employees or other constituents with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions and will give good faith consideration to reasonable comments
proposed by Parent.

  

  

SECTION 5.07 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Subject to applicable
Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford to Parent and Parent's
Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Company's officers, employees, agents, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent and Parent's
Representatives such information concerning its business, personnel, assets,
liabilities and properties as Parent may reasonably request; provided that
Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company; provided, further, however, that the Company shall not be obligated
to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a Contract
or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, waive the protection
of an attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege or expose the Company
to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information.
Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that the Company does not provide
access or information in reliance on the immediately preceding sentence, it
shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding such access or
information and shall use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the
extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate
the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.
All requests for information made pursuant to this Section 5.07 shall be
directed to the Person designated by the Company. Until the Effective Time,
the information provided will be subject to the terms of the letter agreement
dated as of August 18, 2016 by and between the Company and Parent (as may in
the future be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

(b) Parent shall not be deemed to violate any of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement as a result of performing any of its obligations
under this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.08 Indemnification and Insurance. (a) From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an
"Indemnitee" and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions
by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the
Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the
request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee or fiduciary of another Person (including any employee benefit
plan)), in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; provided that no Indemnitee shall be
indemnified against any liability which by virtue of any rule of law attaches
to such Indemnitee in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of which such
Indemnitee may be guilty in relation to the Company, and (ii) assume all
obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect
of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries
as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any agreement in existence as
of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification between the
Company and any Indemnitee. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time, shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the
memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Surviving Company and such
Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees. In addition, from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of
legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.08 (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this Section 5.08) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; provided that the individual to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it shall be determined that
such person is not entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
5.08(a).

  

  

(b) None of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation,
claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered under this
Section 5.08 (each, a "Claim") for which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnitee hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Claim or such Indemnitee otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company and
the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  

  

(c) For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals
who are currently (and any additional individuals who prior to the Effective
Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in
amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor
policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with
respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including a "tail" policy); provided, however, that, if the annual premium for
such insurance shall exceed 300% of the current annual premium (such 300%
threshold, the "Maximum Premium"), then Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided a policy for the applicable individuals with the best coverage as
shall then be available at an annual premium not in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

excess of the Maximum Premium. The Company may in consultation with Parent,
and at the request of Parent shall, prior to the Effective Time, purchase, for
an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate Maximum Premium for six years,
a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing at least
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the Transactions. If such prepaid "tail" policy
has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all
obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 5.08(c) and the
Surviving Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy
to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all
of its obligations thereunder.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.08 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or
her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may
have under the Company Organizational Documents, by contract or otherwise. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this Section 5.08 shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.08 applies unless (A) such
termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected
Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.08
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 5.08).

  

  

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 5.08.

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.08 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  

  

SECTION 5.09 Rule 16b-2. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be
permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be
exempt under Rule 16b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

SECTION 5.10 Employee Matters. (a) Subject to applicable Law, for a period of
two (2) years following the Effective Time or such shorter period as a Company
Employee remains an employee of Parent or its Affiliates following the
Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Company (or in the case of a transfer of all or
substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Company,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

its successors and assigns) to provide, to each individual who is employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a "Company Employee"), an annual rate of base salary and total direct
target compensation opportunity (base salary plus target annual incentive
compensation plus target long-term incentive compensation) that are each no
less favorable than the base salary and total direct target compensation
opportunity provided to such Company Employee by the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. During the Continuation
Period, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide,
the Company Employees with employee benefits that are in aggregate no less
favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any
of its Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), Parent shall provide
to each Company Employee who is terminated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period severance benefits at least equal
to and on terms and conditions no less favorable than the severance benefits
and terms and conditions as set forth on Section 5.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(c) With respect to all employee benefit plans of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries, including any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans but
excluding any equity or equity-based plans), for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, each Company
Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary,
to the extent service with the predecessor employer was recognized by the
Company or such Subsidiary as of the Effective Time in accordance with past
practice) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or in the case of a transfer of all or substantially all the
assets and business of the Surviving Company, its successors and assigns);
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

  

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Company to
use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive, or cause to be waived, any
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements
and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) recognize the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

  

  

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of any Company Plan containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control," the occurrence of
the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of
control."

  

  

(f) With respect to any Company Employee whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parent's obligations under this Section 5.10
shall

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

be modified to the extent necessary to comply with any applicable Law that
applies in relation to the employment or terms of employment of such Company
Employee.

  

  

(g) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide each
Company Employee continuing employment following the Effective Time payments
as set forth in Section 5.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(h) This Section 5.10 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement and nothing in this Section
5.10 or any other provision of this Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the Company
or any of its Affiliates, or Parent or any of its Affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) is
intended to or shall confer upon any current (including any Company Employee)
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this
Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

  

  

SECTION 5.11 Notification of Certain Matters; Shareholder Litigation. Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of any Actions commenced or, to
such party's Knowledge, threatened against such party which relates to this
Agreement or the Transactions. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense and settlement of any shareholder litigation
against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent.

  

  

SECTION 5.12 Voting Matters. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 106 of
the Bermuda Companies Act and in its capacity as the sole shareholder of

SECTION 5.13 Stock Exchange De-listing. Parent and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Company's securities to be de-

SECTION 5.14 Credit Facility Matters. If requested by Parent, the Company
shall provide reasonable cooperation to Parent and Merger Sub in arranging
for, at the Closing, the termination of existing indebtedness (including of

documentation in connection therewith. In the event that Parent determines in
its reasonable discretion that it is necessary or desirable to obtain
amendments to any of the Existing Credit Facilities on or prior to the Closing
Date in order to, among other things, permit the consummation of the
Transactions, then the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and to cause its
Representatives to cooperate, with Parent in connection with the arrangement
and consummation of any such amendments to the Existing Credit Facilities;
provided, that, (a) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the

the occurrence of the Closing, (c) such amendments do not constitute a
significant modification within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1001-3 unless contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing and (d) the
Closing shall in no event be conditioned or contingent upon any amendments to
the Existing Credit Facilities.

SECTION 6.04 Frustration of Closing Conditions. The Company may not rely on
the failure of any condition set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.03 to be
satisfied if such failure was primarily caused by the failure of the Company
to perform in all material respects any of its obligations under this
Agreement, including to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Transactions as required by and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 6.01 or Section 6.02 to be satisfied if such
failure was primarily caused by the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to perform
in all material respects any of its obligations under this Agreement,
including to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Transactions as

ARTICLE VII

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

SECTION 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval (except as otherwise
expressly noted):

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
each of their respective Boards of Directors;

  

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before July 5, 2017
(as such date may be extended pursuant to the first proviso to this Section
7.01(b)(i), the "Walk-Away Date"); provided, however, that if on such date the
condition precedent to the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Section 6.01(b) or Section
6.02(d) shall not have been satisfied but all other conditions precedent to
the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby
have been satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing are capable of being satisfied on that date), then
the Walk-Away Date shall automatically be extended to October 5, 2017 without
any action by any party; provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if
the breach in any material respect by such party of its representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement or the failure in any material respect
of such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
including pursuant to Section 5.04, has been a primary cause of or resulted in
the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such date (it being
understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a single party for
purposes of the foregoing proviso);

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 6.01(c) shall be
in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided that the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)(ii)
shall have performed in all material respects its obligations under this
Agreement, including to use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry
of and to remove such Restraint in accordance with its obligations under this

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the
Company Shareholders Meeting duly convened therefor or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof;

  

  

(c) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if the Company shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement (other than Section 5.02, which is addressed in Section
7.01(c)(ii)), which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.02(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of being
cured, has not been cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after the
Company's receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform from
Parent stating Parent's intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.01(c)(i) and the basis for such termination (or in any event has not
been cured by the Walk-Away Date); provided that Parent shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(c)(i) if
Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its material
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  

  

(ii) prior to the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 6.01(a),
if (A) the Board of Directors of the Company makes an Adverse Recommendation
Change, (B) there shall have occurred any material breach of Section 5.02 by
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative of the
Company or (C) the Board of Directors of the Company has publicly proposed to
do any of the foregoing; or

  

  

(d) by the Company:

  

  

(i) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its representations or
warranties or failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03(a) or 6.03(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date, or if capable of being
cured, has not been cured by Parent or Merger Sub within thirty (30) days
after Parent's receipt of written notice of such breach or failure to perform
from the Company stating the Company's intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.01(d)(i) and the basis for such termination (or in
any event has not been cured by the Walk-Away Date); provided that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.01(d)(i) if the Company is then in material breach of any of its material
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder; or

  

  

(ii) at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, if the
Board of Directors of the Company has authorized the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal when
permitted to do so in accordance with Section 5.02(c)(iii) and, concurrently
with such termination, the Company enters into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and pays to Parent an amount equal

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

to the Termination Fee plus Expenses in accordance with Section 7.03(a)(i)(E).

  

  

SECTION 7.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.01, written notice thereof shall be given
to the other party or parties hereto, specifying the provision hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become
null and void (other than this Section 7.02, Section 7.03, Article VIII, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective
directors, officers and Affiliates, except (a) as liability may exist pursuant
to the provisions specified in the immediately preceding parenthetical that
survive such termination and (b) that no such termination shall relieve any
party from liability for any willful and material breach by such party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or
fraud.

  

  

SECTION 7.03 Termination Fee. (a) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid,
to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to:

  

  

(i) $204.9 million (the "Termination Fee") plus Expenses, if:

  

  

(A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(ii) (in
which case payment shall be made within two (2) business days of such
termination);

  

  

(B) (1) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made or proposed to the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives, or
otherwise publicly announced or made known, from and after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting (which Takeover
Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn at least ninety (90) days prior to
the Walk-Away Date), (2) prior to the Walk-Away Date, the Required Regulatory
Approvals shall have been obtained (assuming the Company is in compliance with
its obligations pursuant to Section 5.04), (3) this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) and (4) within
twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, the Company enters
into a Contract providing for the implementation of, or consummates, a
Takeover Proposal (whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same Takeover
Proposal referred to in clause (1) and deeming, for purposes of this Section
7.03(a)(i)(B)(4) only, each reference in the definition of "Takeover Proposal"
to "15%" to be "50%"), in which case payment shall be made within two (2)
business days of the earliest of (x) the date on which the Company enters into
such a Contract and (y) the date on which any such Takeover Proposal is
implemented or consummated;

  

  

(C) (1) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made or proposed to the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives, or

the Company Shareholders Meeting), (2) this Agreement is terminated by either
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 

7.01(b)(iii) and (3) within twelve (12) months following the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a Contract providing for the
implementation of, or consummates, a Takeover Proposal (whether or not such
Takeover Proposal is the same Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (1) and
deeming, for purposes of this Section 7.03(a)(i)(C)(3) only, each reference in
the definition of "Takeover Proposal" to "15%" to be "50%"), in which case
payment shall be made within two (2) business days of the earliest of (x) the
date on which the Company enters into such a Contract and (y) the date on
which any such Takeover Proposal is implemented or consummated;

  

  

(D) (1) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made or proposed to the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives, or
otherwise publicly announced or made known, from and after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting (which Takeover

the date on which a breach described in Section 7.01(c)(i) occurs), (2) this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i) and (3)
within twelve (12) months following the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a Contract providing for the implementation of, or consummates, a
Takeover Proposal (whether or not such Takeover Proposal is the same Takeover
Proposal referred to in clause (1) and deeming, for purposes of this Section
7.03(a)(i)(D)(3) only, each reference in the definition of "Takeover Proposal"
to "15%" to be "50%"), in which case payment shall be made within two (2)
business days of the earliest of (x) the date on which the Company enters into
such a Contract and (y) the date on which any such Takeover Proposal is
implemented or consummated; or

  

  

(E) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(d)(ii); and

  

  

(ii) Expenses if:

business days of such termination); or

  

  

(B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(i) (in
which case payment shall be made within two (2) business days of such
termination).

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay
an aggregate amount in excess of the Termination Fee plus Expenses pursuant to
this Section 7.03(a).

  

  

(b) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company, by wire transfer of

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 7.03 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that without
these agreements, the other parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if a party (the "Breaching Party") fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.03, and, in order to obtain the
payment, another party hereto commences an Action which results in a judgment
against the Breaching Party for the payment set forth in this Section 7.03,
the Breaching Party shall pay such other party for its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such Action, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received.

  

  

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Termination Fee nor the
Expenses shall constitute either a penalty or liquidated damages, and the
right of either party to receive, or the receipt of, the Termination Fee
and/or Expenses shall not limit or otherwise affect such party's right to
specific performance as provided in Section 8.08 prior to the effective
termination of this Agreement or any right (if any) a party may have pursuant
to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b); provided, that the amount of any
damages recovered pursuant to Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) by a party
shall be reduced by the amount of any Termination Fee or Expenses previously
paid to such party.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

SECTION 8.01 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. This Article VIII
and the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article
II, Section 5.08 and Section 5.10 shall survive the Effective Time. No other
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 8.02 Amendment or Supplement. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by written
agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of
Directors; provided, however, that following approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, there shall be no amendment or
change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by
the shareholders of the Company without such approval.

  

  

SECTION 8.03 Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company may, subject to applicable Law, (a)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
party, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
acts of the other party or (c) subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
waive compliance by the other party with any of the agreements contained
herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's
conditions (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub shall be deemed a
single party for purposes of the foregoing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

SECTION 8.04 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. No assignment by any party shall
relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
immediately preceding two (2) sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not
permitted under this Section 8.04 shall be null and void.

  

  

SECTION 8.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic mail), each of which shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to
the other parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 8.06 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
together with the exhibits and schedules attached hereto, the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto and their Affiliates, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) are not
intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto
any rights or remedies hereunder, except for, if the Effective Time occurs,
(i) the right of the holders of Company Shares to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in accordance with Article II and (ii) the provisions
set forth in Section 5.08 of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to
waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 8.03 without notice or
liability to any other Person. Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

  

  

SECTION 8.07 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. (a) This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely in that
state, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable
conflict of laws principles, except to the extent any provisions of this
Agreement which relate to the exercise of a director's or officer's fiduciary
duties, statutory duties, obligations and/or statutory provisions, or which
arise under, the Laws of Bermuda (including those applicable to the Merger)
shall be governed by and in accordance with the Laws of Bermuda.

  

  

(b) All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to the
extent any such proceeding mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda) shall be
heard and determined in the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State of Delaware (the
"Chosen Courts") and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such action or
proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or lack
of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth in this Section 8.07(b) shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other
than the parties hereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of process upon
such party in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the
address set forth in Section 8.11 of this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent and the Merger Sub irrevocably appoint The Corporation Trust
Company as their agent for service of process for purposes of any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided, however, that
nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

  

  

SECTION 8.08 Specific Enforcement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the right of the Company or Parent to cause the Merger to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement) in the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The
parties hereto agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section

SECTION 8.15 Interpretation. (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an
Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The terms "or," "any" and "either" are not exclusive. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."
The word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the
word "shall." The phrase "ordinary course of business" shall be construed to
be followed by the phrase "consistent with past practice" regardless of
whether such phrase is expressed. The phrase "provided or made available" with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be construed to mean
posted and accessible to Parent in the "Project Maru" datasite operated by
IntraLinks, Inc., and which has been posted to such datasite prior to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in
this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of
such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders
of such term. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein, provided that with respect to agreements and
instruments, any such amendment, modification or supplement made after the
date of this Agreement shall be made in accordance with Section 5.01(a).
Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" or "$"
shall refer to the lawful money of the United States. References to a Person
are also to its permitted assigns and successors. Whenever the last day for
the exercise of any right or the discharge of any duty under this Agreement
falls on a day other than a business day, the party having such right or duty
shall have until the next business day to exercise such right or discharge
such duty.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

70  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly
drafted by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.
