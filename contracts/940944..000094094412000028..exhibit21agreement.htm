2.1 The Merger. In accordance with the DGCL and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as
the "Surviving Corporation") and will continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware. The Merger will have the effects specified in the DGCL.

(a) Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date after the Closing occurs, the parties will
file with the Delaware Secretary of State a Certificate of Merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") with respect to the Merger, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and will
make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effect the
Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger has been duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, or at such
subsequent date or time as Parent and the Company may agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time that is the effective time of the Merger being
hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

(b) Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in DGCL Section 259. (c) Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(i) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share
of Merger Sub Common Stock will be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) Conversion of Class A Common Stock. Each share of Class A Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Appraisal Shares) will be converted into the right to receive, upon surrender
of a Share Certificate formerly representing such shares in the manner
provided in Section 2.3, the Class A Merger Consideration, without interest,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, all
shares of Class A Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of a Share
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Class A Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.

(iii) Conversion of Class B Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Appraisal Shares) will be converted into the right to receive, upon surrender
of a Share Certificate formerly representing such shares in the manner
provided in Section 2.3, the Class B Merger Consideration, without interest,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, all
shares of Class B Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist, and each holder of a Share
Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Class B Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II.

(iv) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
(the "Appraisal Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") will not be
converted into the right to receive the Class A Merger Consideration or Class
B Merger Consideration, as applicable, as provided in Section 2.1(c)(ii) or
2.1(c)(iii), as applicable, but instead such holder will be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist, and
each holder of Appraisal Shares will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any holder of Appraisal Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair
value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 will cease and each
such Appraisal Share will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and will have become, the right to receive the Class A Merger
Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which such
Person is entitled under Section 2.1(c)(ii) or 2.1(c)(iii), as applicable. The
Company will serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, and Parent will have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

(v) Treasury Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or held as treasury stock or otherwise), if any, shall be
automatically cancelled and extinguished, without any conversion thereof nor
payment or distribution made with respect thereto.

(vi) Aggregate Consideration. Under no circumstances will Parent be required
to pay an aggregate amount in excess of the Adjusted Equity Price to the
stockholders or option holders of the Company in connection with the Merger.
For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, Parent shall retain any amount that otherwise would have been
paid to holders of Appraisal Shares in connection with the Merger.

of Merger Sub will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving

Sub shall be amended to be references to "Yard House USA, Inc." At the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company will be amended to be identical to
the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that the name of the Surviving Corporation in the bylaws
shall be "Yard House USA, Inc.," and as so amended will be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

the Effective Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or

Conversion Option will be canceled, without any consideration to be paid or
payable in connection therewith, and (ii) each outstanding Conversion Option
will be canceled and the holder thereof (an "Eligible Option Holder") will,
subject to Section 2.3, be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation,
immediately following the Effective Time, an amount in cash (the "Option
Merger Consideration"), equal to (i)(A) the sum of the Adjusted Equity Price
minus the aggregate Class B Merger Consideration payable under this Agreement
plus the aggregate exercise price for all Conversion Options, divided by (B)
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock that would be outstanding at the
Effective Time if all Conversion Options were fully exercised, multiplied by
(C) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of
such Conversion Option, minus (ii) the aggregate exercise price for such
Conversion Option. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the
sum of the aggregate Class A Merger Consideration, the aggregate Class B
Merger Consideration and the aggregate Option Merger Consideration be greater
than the Adjusted Equity Price.

(b) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
will take all actions as are necessary, including obtaining any required
consents, to (i) give effect to the treatment of each outstanding Option
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) terminate the Stock Plans as of the

pay, or deposit with the Exchange Agent, the Adjusted Equity Price for the
benefit of the holders of all Share Certificates and all Conversion Options,

this Agreement to receive their portion of the Merger Consideration, and (y)

Consideration Recipients to be distributed in accordance with Sections 2.3(d)
and 2.3(e). All such cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.3(b)(ii), as it may be depleted from time to time to effect the
exchange provisions of this Section 2.3, is hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund."

(c) Aggregate Merger Consideration Spreadsheet. On the day prior to the

Options held by any Eligible Option Holder, will be updated by the Company, if
necessary, based on the Company's records as of the Closing Date.

customary form as reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company which (A) will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Share Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Share Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and (B) will have such other provisions as the Company and
Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Share Certificates in exchange for the aggregate Class A
Merger Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as appropriate, to which
such Person is entitled. Upon proper surrender of a Share Certificate to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
Exchange Documentation as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Share Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the aggregate Class A Merger Consideration or Class B Merger
Consideration, as appropriate, to which such Person is entitled pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, and the Share Certificate so surrendered will
immediately be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Class A Common
Stock or Class B Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the aggregate Class A Merger Consideration or Class B Merger
Consideration, as appropriate, to which such Person is entitled may be paid to
a transferee if the Share Certificate representing such shares is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(d), each
Share Certificate will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Class A Merger
Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as appropriate, that the holder
of such Share Certificate(s) has the right to receive in respect of such Share
Certificate(s) pursuant to Section 2.1. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Share Certificate.

(e) Option Conversion Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Eligible
Option Holder whose Conversion Options were converted pursuant to Section 2.2
instructions for effecting the cancellation of the Conversion Options in
exchange for the aggregate Option Merger Consideration to which such Person is
entitled. Upon cancellation of a Conversion Option in compliance with the
instructions provided by the Exchange Agent and execution or compliance with
such documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, such
Eligible Option Holder will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
aggregate Option Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled. In the
event of a transfer of a Conversion Option that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the aggregate Option Merger Consideration to
which the Eligible Option Holder is entitled may be paid to a transferee if
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that
any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid are presented to the Exchange
Agent. Until canceled as contemplated by this Section 2.3(e), each Conversion
Option will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon cancellation of such Conversion Option the aggregate
Option Merger Consideration that such Eligible Option Holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Conversion Option pursuant to Section 2.2. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon cancellation of
any Conversion Option.

(f) No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. The Class A Merger
Consideration, the Class B Merger Consideration or the Option Merger
Consideration, as appropriate, paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II will be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such share of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common
Stock or Conversion Option, as appropriate. From and after the Effective Time,
(i) each holder of Share Certificates will cease to have any rights as a
Company Stockholder other than the right to receive the aggregate Class A
Merger Consideration or Class B Merger Consideration, as appropriate, to which
such Person is entitled under this Agreement; and (ii) each holder of an
Option will cease to have any rights other than, in the case of Eligible
Option Holders, the right to receive the aggregate Option Merger Consideration
to which such Person is entitled. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed with respect to
all shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and all Options
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Class A Common
Stock, Class B Common Stock or Options that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any certificates formerly
representing shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Options
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Share Certificates
or Eligible Option Holders for 180 days after the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Share Certificates or
Eligible Option Holder who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
will thereafter look only to the Parent for satisfaction of its claim for the
aggregate Class A Merger Consideration, Class B Merger Consideration or Option
Merger Consideration, as appropriate, to which such Person is entitled.

(h) No Liability. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any portion of the cash to be paid in accordance with this Article
II that remains undistributed to the holders of Share Certificates or Eligible
Option Holders as of the second anniversary of the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which such cash would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent will invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided, however,
that no such investment or losses will affect the cash payable to holders of
Share Certificates or the Eligible Option Holders. Any interest or other
amounts received with respect to such investments will be paid to Parent.

(j) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of a Share Certificate or an Eligible Option
Holder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Laws related to Taxes. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Share Certificate or Eligible Option Holder in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

(k) Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to the
contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time there
shall have been a change in the number of any shares of Company Common Stock
or of any other class of equity interests of the Company by reason of the
occurrence or record date of any dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of membership interests or
similar transaction, the distribution of the Adjusted Equity Price pursuant to
this Article II shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

(l) Lost Share Certificates. If any Share Certificate will have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Share Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
2.3(g), Parent) will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Share Certificate, the aggregate Class A Merger Consideration or Class B
Merger Consideration, as appropriate, to which such Person is entitled.

2.4 Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") will take place at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 555 West
5th Street, Suite 4000, Los Angeles, California 90013, as soon as practicable,
but not later than five (5) Business Days, after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions to the obligations of the Parties set forth in Article VII
(other than those that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) or
at such other time and place and on such other date as the Company and Parent
shall agree (the "Closing Date"); provided, however, that the Closing shall
not, in any event, take place before August 29, 2012.

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF 
THE COMPANY

The Company hereby warrants and represents to Parent and Merger Sub as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing (as if made anew at and as of the
Closing) as follows:

3.1 Organization; Qualification.

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with all necessary power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and assets and to carry on
the Business as conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted, and is
duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties and assets or the
nature of the Business makes such qualification necessary, which jurisdictions
are listed on Schedule 3.1. (b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws (in each case, as amended,
and collectively, the "Company Charter Documents"), in each case, as in effect
as of the date hereof. The Company is not in default or violation of any of
the Company Charter Documents.

3.2 Authorization; Enforceability; Fairness.

(a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the other agreements, instruments, certificates and
documents delivered pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the "Ancillary
Agreements") and the capacity and authority to make and perform the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations and agreements made by the
Company herein and therein. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements by the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the other Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party or for the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other than obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes, and as of the Closing, each
Ancillary Agreement to which the Company is a party, will constitute, when
executed and delivered by the Company, the legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company has, by the unanimous vote of all
directors: (i) determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interest
of, the Company and the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable the Merger and this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of
the DGCL, (iii) directed that this Agreement and the Merger be submitted to
the Company Stockholders for their adoption and (iv) resolved to recommend
that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
The Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion of the
Company's financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, dated the date
hereof, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, on the basis of
and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth in
the opinion, the Merger Consideration to be paid in the aggregate to the
Company Stockholders, taken as a group, pursuant to the Merger is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the Company Stockholders. It is agreed and
understood that such opinion is for the benefit of the Board of Directors of
the Company and may not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub.

(c) The adoption of this Agreement by holders of at least a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock, voting together as a single class (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval"), is
the only vote required from the holders of any shares of the Company's capital
stock to authorize, adopt or approve this Agreement or to consummate the
Merger or other transactions contemplated herein. Subject to compliance with
Section 228 of the DGCL, there are no restrictions on the ability of the
Company to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval pursuant to written
consent of the Company Stockholders without a meeting. The Party Company
Stockholders collectively own a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to constitute the Requisite Shareholder Approval.

the Company, (i) its name and jurisdiction of organization and (ii) the number
of authorized, issued and outstanding shares for each class of its capital
stock or other equity interests and the holder(s) thereof. All of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary have been duly authorized and are validly issued. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.3, the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries holds of
record and owns beneficially all of the outstanding shares or other equity
interests of each Subsidiary free and clear of any restrictions on transfer,
Liens, options, warrants, purchase rights, contracts, commitments, equities,
claims and demands. No Subsidiary is in default under or in violation of any
provision of its charter or bylaws or other similar organizational documents.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries controls directly or
indirectly or has any direct or indirect equity participation in any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other business
association that is not a Subsidiary of the Company. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.3, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns, controls
or has any right to acquire, directly or indirectly, any membership interests,
partnership interests, shares of capital stock, equity interests or other
securities of any Person.

Company and each of its Subsidiaries are complete and correct in all material
respects and have been maintained in accordance with sound business and
accounting practices.

and each of its Subsidiaries contain accurate and complete records of all
meetings held by, and corporate actions taken by, the Company Stockholders or
equity owners and the Board of Directors or comparable governing body of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and no meeting of any
such Company Stockholders or equity owners or the Board of Directors or
comparable governing body of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as

any material weaknesses in internal controls and any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees of the Company who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls. There are no
significant deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the design or
operation of the Company's internal controls that adversely affect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data,
except as set forth in the reports of its independent auditors on internal
controls, including management recommendation letters, for the periods covered
by the Financial Statements, copies of which are included as Schedule 3.4(d).

3.5 Non-Contravention; Consents. Neither the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (a) will
conflict with or result in a breach, or violation of, or cause acceleration,
or constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default,
or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration, under
any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (i) any of the Company Charter
Documents or the organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement,
document, instrument, Law, Order, certificate or other obligation to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or to which either the Company
or any such Subsidiary is subject or to which any of its properties or assets
may be bound, (b) will result in the creation of any material Lien on any
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (c) except
as disclosed in Schedule 3.5, will require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to obtain the consent of any Person other than a Governmental
Authority not already obtained except, in the case of clause (c), for such
consents the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to result in a
liability that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement or as would not reasonably be expected to result in a liability that
is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no consent,

with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to authorize,
or is otherwise required in connection with, the execution and delivery of

the Company of the terms hereof or thereof or the validity or enforceability
of this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, except for such filings and
approvals, if any, as may be required under the HSR Act, the DGCL or as set
forth on Schedule 3.5. 3.6 Governmental Authorizations. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
result in a liability that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, the Company and its Subsidiaries hold such licenses
(including all liquor licenses), permits, consents, authorizations, variances,

necessary to carry on the Business as currently conducted ("Permits"), and the
Permits are in full force and effect and are being complied with by each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. With respect to any liquor licenses held by
either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and except as would not
reasonably be expected to result in a liability that is material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there are no pending
disciplinary actions or past disciplinary actions that would reasonably be
expected to have any adverse impact on current operations of the Business, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or negatively affect the nature or level of
discipline imposed on account of any future violations of the Laws related to
sales and service of alcoholic beverages.

Real Property are legal, valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights

result in a liability that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, all capital equipment, together with all other machinery,

Agreement, the Requisite Stockholder Approval by written consent in lieu of a
meeting of stockholders in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL, which
written consents shall become effective and be irrevocable upon delivery to the Company and in a form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the "Written Consents").
Promptly, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days, after the Written
Consents have become effective, the Company shall, in accordance with the
Company Charter Documents and Sections 228(e) and 262(d)(2) of the DGCL,
deliver to each Company Stockholder entitled thereto a notice and information
statement (together, the "Information Statement") that (a) informs such
Company Stockholder of the adoption of this Agreement by written consent, of
the availability of appraisal rights and such other information as may be
required under Delaware law and (b) requests that such Company Stockholder (i)
execute a written consent, which written consent shall be substantially
similar in form and substance to the Written Consents, and (ii) execute a
release of all claims such Company Stockholder may have against the Company or
its directors, officers, Subsidiaries or Affiliates. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent with copies of all such written consents and releases
upon the Company's receipt thereof. Prior to mailing the Information
Statement, the Company shall (x) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Information Statement and (y) consider in good faith
all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. The Information Statement shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and shall otherwise comply in all respects
with applicable Law.

6.7 Further Actions. Prior to the Closing, each of the Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, do or cause to be done all things necessary under applicable Laws,
including obtaining any necessary consents or approvals from, or making any
necessary filings with any domestic or foreign regulatory agencies.

6.8 DandO Indemnification; DandO Insurance.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, a "DandO Indemnified Party")
will be remain obligations of the Company and will survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) For the six (6) year period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect, through an extended reporting period
endorsement, the Company's current directors' and officers' liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any directors or
officers of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company who prior to the
Effective Time become) covered by the Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy on the same terms and scope with respect to such
coverage, and amount, for such individuals; provided, however, that, in no
event will Parent be required to expend for any year of such six-year period
an amount in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the current
annual premium; and provided, further, that Parent may, in its sole
discretion, opt to purchase a replacement, substitute or "tail" policy so long
as any such replacement, substitution or tail policy does not result in gaps in coverage. Parent will maintain such policy in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent will cause to be maintained the most
advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 will survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. Parent will pay or
cause to be paid (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, that a DandO Indemnified Party may incur in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.8 (subject to
reimbursement if the DandO Indemnified Party is subsequently determined not to
be entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.8).

(d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, as the case may be, will
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

6.9 Employee Matters.

(a) During the period from the Closing Date until the 12-month anniversary
thereof, Parent will, or will cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each
Person who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees"), compensation
(including base salary and incentive and bonus opportunities, but excluding
equity based compensation) and benefits (including vacation, paid time-off and
severance) that are not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) than
those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent's Subsidiaries. In
addition to the foregoing, during the period from the Closing Date until the
12-month anniversary thereof, Parent will not reduce the base salary of any
Continuing Employee who is a salaried employee.

(b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of its

accruals (other than defined benefit pension plan accruals or where such
service would result in duplication of benefits).

in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible
to participate after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-
work requirement or waiting period to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was
satisfied or waived under the comparable the Employee Plan of the Company as

each of the Employee Plans, in accordance with its terms, including any rights
or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated by this

will be construed to prevent Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from (i)
terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of, any Continuing Employee
following the Closing Date, including to terminate, reassign or demote any
Continuing Employee or to change, adversely or favorably, the title, powers,
duties, responsibilities, location, compensation or terms or conditions of
employment of such Continuing Employee or (ii) terminating or modifying to any
extent any Employee Plan of the Company or Parent or any other employee
benefit plan, program, practice, agreement or arrangement that Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries may establish or maintain; provided, however, that to the
extent that, and for so long as, a Continuing Employee remains employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during the 12-month period following the
Closing, the compensation and benefits payable to such employee during such
period will be subject to Section 6.9(a). Nothing in this Agreement will be

(a) For purposes of this Section 10.3, a party against which indemnification

(b) The obligations of Indemnifying Parties with respect to Losses arising
from claims of any third party that are subject to the indemnification
provided for in this Article X ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by the
following additional terms and conditions:

(i) if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party
Claim within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
notice; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release an Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article X
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the
facts known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such Third Party Claim,
together with copies of any material document received from the third party
claimant asserting the claim.

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume control of the defense
of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice,
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, if it (A) gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days of
the receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party in
accordance with Section 10.3(b)(i) and (B) confirms in writing to the
Indemnified Party that such Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified
Party against such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that, if the named
parties to any such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party and, in the opinion of counsel of the Indemnified Party
there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest between
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which
the Indemnified Party reasonably determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense
against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available
to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's
possession or under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, including copies of any
summons, complaint or other pleadings that may have been served on such
Indemnified Party and any written claim or demand. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 10.3(b)(ii), the Indemnified Party may participate in
the defense of any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choosing and at its
sole cost and expense. In the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or
indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement or compromise with respect to any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except to the
extent that the judgment, settlement or compromise involves solely a monetary
payment to be satisfied entirely by the Indemnifying Party and, in the case of
a settlement or compromise, includes a full release from all liability with
respect to such claim (or any potential similar or analogous claims) of the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates and does not involve any admission of any
violation of Law.

(c) To the extent any Indemnified Party recognizes any Indemnification Tax
Benefits, or actually receives any insurance proceeds, net of any out-of-
pocket costs (including any deductibles and the allocable portion of insurance
premiums paid by the Indemnified Party with respect to such insurance policy
since the Closing) of obtaining such insurance proceeds, as a result of any
Losses as to which the Indemnifying Party has indemnified the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall pay an amount equal to such net insurance
proceeds or Indemnification Tax Benefits to the Indemnifying Party within
sixty (60) days of such insurance proceeds being received or Indemnification
Tax Benefits being recognized by the Indemnified Party; provided, however, to
the extent such net insurance proceeds are received or Indemnification Tax
Benefits are recognized prior to the Indemnifying Party paying the amount of
the Losses to the Indemnified Party, the amount of Losses payable by the
Indemnifying Party shall be reduced by the amount of Indemnification Tax
Benefits actually recognized and the amount of such net insurance proceeds
actually received.

(d) All indemnification payments under this Agreement shall be deemed
adjustments to the Merger Consideration to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.

10.4 Certain Damages. NO INDEMNIFYING PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR PUNITIVE OR SPECIAL DAMAGES SUFFERED BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY WITH RESPECT TO
ANY TERM OR THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THIS
WAIVER WILL NOT LIMIT ANY LIABILITY OF AN INDEMNIFYING PARTY TO INDEMNIFY ANY
INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY LOSS ARISING FROM DAMAGES OF ANY KIND THAT THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY TO ANY THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING ANY
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY.

10.5 Exclusive Remedy. After the Effective Time, the sole and exclusive
remedies for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
hereunder shall be the indemnification provided by this Article X, and each
Party expressly waives any other rights or remedies it may have; provided,
however, that equitable relief, including the remedies of specific performance
and injunction, shall be available with respect to any matter where money
damages would not be sufficient to compensate the Parties or to preserve the
rights of a Party pending resolution of a dispute, and this Section 10.5 shall
not relieve any Party from liability for willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud
or willful breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE XI 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in this Article XI and
Section 6.8 after the Effective Time, nothing in this Agreement will provide

that this Agreement will not be construed as a third party beneficiary
contract.

Agreement, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement

11.4 Headings. The descriptive headings of the several Articles and Sections
of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a
part of the Agreement.

11.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the documents to be executed hereunder,
the Disclosure Schedules attached hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

11.6 Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company and the Party Company Stockholders, on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of any other Parties or (b) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of any other Parties or with any conditions to its own obligations.
Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or waiver
will be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such Party. The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
be deemed a waiver of the right any Party may have hereunder with respect to
any other Party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in or related to this Agreement being incorrect, untrue or breached.

11.7 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the Parties. No supplement, alteration or
modification of this Agreement will be binding unless executed in writing by
the Parties.

11.8 Public Statements. The initial press releases with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the
Company. Prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any Party Company
Stockholder shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement (to the extent not (x) previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement or (y) substantively consistent with any such
press release or other public announcement) with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of Parent and TSG (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as may be required by Law (in which
case such Party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release
or other public announcement without prior consultation with Parent and TSG).

11.9 Assignment. The provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and assigns, but no Party may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of each other Party to this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent
may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, provided that such assignment
shall not relieve Parent of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

11.10 Independent Covenants. The covenants contained herein are independent
and separate, and in the event that any provision contained herein is declared
invalid or illegal, the other provisions hereof will not be affected or
impaired thereby and will remain valid and enforceable.

11.11 Governing Law. This Agreement and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto and the legal relations between the Parties will be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to principles of conflict of laws.

11.12 Jurisdiction; Venue. (a) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of all state and federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware,
including to the jurisdiction of all courts to which an appeal may be taken
from such courts, in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any facts and circumstances leading to its execution or performance, (ii)
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action, suit or proceeding must
be brought, heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (provided that, in the event subject matter jurisdiction is
declined by or unavailable in the Court of Chancery, then such action, suit or
proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in any other state or
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), (iii) agrees that it shall
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from such courts, (iv) agrees not to bring any action, suit
or proceeding against any other Party arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any facts
and circumstances leading to its execution or performance in any other court
and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action, suit or proceeding so brought. The Parties agree that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. Each of the Parties agrees to waive any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect to any action,
suit or proceeding, including any appeal thereof.

(b) Each of the Parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document in accordance with Section 11.3 shall be effective service of process
for any action, suit or proceeding brought against it by the other Party in
connection with Section 11.12(a); provided, however, that nothing contained
herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
consents to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 11.12(b) shall not
constitute general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and
shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 11.12
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties.

(c) EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB, THE COMPANY AND THE PARTY COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THE FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES
LEADING TO ITS EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (i) NO PARTY OR REPRESENTATIVE OR AFFILIATE THEREOF HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVER, (iii) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH.

11.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when so executed will be deemed an original but
all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of
an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by electronic transmission of a .pdf or other electronic file
shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this
Agreement.

11.14 Withholding or Granting of Consent. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Party hereto may, with respect to any consent or approval that
such Party is entitled to grant pursuant to this Agreement or any other
document or instrument or agreement delivered or entered into pursuant hereto,
grant or withhold such consent or approval in its sole and uncontrolled
discretion, with or without cause, and subject to such conditions as it will
deem appropriate.

11.15 Specific Enforcement. The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the business of the Company and the transactions contemplated
hereby, neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor the Company or the Party Company
Stockholders will have an adequate remedy at law for money damages in the
event that this Agreement has not been performed in accordance with its terms
by the other Parties, and therefore, the Parties agree that Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, will be entitled to specific enforcement of the
terms hereof with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby in the event
of breach by the other Party in addition to any other remedy to which the
Parties may be entitled, at Law or in equity, for such breach. In addition,
the Parties agree that any breach of any covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement by the Company or the Party Company Stockholders will cause
Parent and Merger Sub irreparable injury and damage. The Company and the Party
Company Stockholders therefore expressly agree that Parent and Merger Sub will
be entitled to seek specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable
relief to prevent an anticipatory or continuing breach and to secure
enforcement of any part of such covenants or agreements. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by
Parent or the Company of any right they may now have or hereafter acquire to
monetary damages from the other Parties by reason of any injury to its
property, or otherwise arising out of any breach or any otherwise wrongful act
or omission by such Parties.
