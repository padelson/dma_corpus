Law.

the Surviving Company until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

1.6 Directors of the Surviving Company. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws.



1.7 Officers of the Surviving Company. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary so that the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

ARTICLE II \- EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON SECURITIES; EXCHANGE

2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

(a) At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub:

(i) Merger Consideration. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned
by Parent or Merger Sub or Shares held in treasury, if any (each such Share,
an "Excluded Share" and, collectively, "Excluded Shares")) shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive 0.450 (the "Exchange Ratio")
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
(the "Merger Consideration").

(ii) At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and (A) each certificate (a "Certificate") formerly representing any of the
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and (B) each book-entry account formerly
representing any uncertificated Shares ("Uncertificated Shares") (other than
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, any distributions or dividends payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), without interest, in each case to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2, in the case of certificated Shares, and upon
receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form in
accordance with Section 2.2(i) in the case of Uncertificated Shares.

(iii) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(b) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Company, and such converted shares shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company.

2.2 Exchange of Certificates.



(a) Exchange Agent and Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "Exchange
Agent"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company's
stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence
of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in book-
entry form equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e)), and (ii) cash
in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay any dividends
under Section 2.2(c) (such evidence of book-entry shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"), in each case, for the sole benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to pay any dividends under Section 2.2(c), Parent
shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with
the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make,
and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration and
any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares
of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(c) out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash
portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; provided, however, that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares entitled to receive such amounts
pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Company on the earlier of (A) one
(1) year after the Effective Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange
Fund.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of Shares represented by a Certificate (other than
holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the
Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii)
instructions for surrendering the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as
provided in Section 2.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor one or more shares of Parent



Common Stock which shall represent, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
Section 2.2(h). The Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender
of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. All shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the
record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in the Merger. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger shall be paid
to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)), there shall
be issued and/or paid to the holder of the whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest thereon, (A) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
stockholder of Parent. The Exchange Agent, acting as agent for the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to receive fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, will aggregate all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock that would otherwise have been required to be distributed and cause them
to be sold in the open market for the accounts of such holders.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash, rounded to the nearest whole cent and
without interest, in an amount equal to the proceeds from such sale by the
Exchange Agent, if any, less any brokerage



commissions or other fees, transfer Taxes or other out-of-pocket transaction
costs, as well as any expenses of the Exchange Agent incurred from the sale of
such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with such holder's
fractional interest in the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
sold.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed
by the stockholders of the Company for one-hundred and eighty (180) days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parent's option, to Parent. Any
holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any
shares of Parent Common Stock and payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares
and any dividends and other distributions in respect of the Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
2.2(h)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(g)), without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Company, Parent,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, immediately prior to the date any Merger Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, such
Merger Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Company, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person
of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the cash in lieu of fractional
shares, shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends and other
distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock that would have been
issuable or payable pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h))
had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

(h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and



withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(i) Uncertificated Shares. Any holder of Uncertificated Shares shall not be
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the
Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II in respect
of such Uncertificated Shares. In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one
or more Uncertificated Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, any distributions or dividends payable
pursuant to Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e), shall, upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" in customary form (or such other
evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled
to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay
and deliver as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock payable pursuant to Section 2.2(e) for each Uncertificated Share, and
the Uncertificated Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable to a holder of
Uncertificated Shares.

2.3 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. In the event that the Company changes the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for any such Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for any
such Parent Common Stock, in each case issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
subdivision, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event on the Merger
Consideration.

2.4 Treatment of Equity Awards.

(a) Treatment of Restricted Stock Units. Each outstanding Company RSU, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a Parent restricted stock
unit award on the terms and conditions (including, if applicable, any
continuing vesting requirements and vesting acceleration terms) under the
Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreement in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying (i)
the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

(b) Treatment of Performance Stock Units. Each Company PSU, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
as of the Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into a Parent restricted stock unit award
that vests solely based on the passage of time



on the terms and conditions (including, if applicable, any continuing vesting
requirements and vesting acceleration terms) under the Company Stock Plan and
applicable award agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
with respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded up to the
nearest whole share, determined by multiplying (i) the number of Shares
subject to such Company PSU determined pursuant to the applicable award
agreement governing the Company PSU that would vest based on the terms of such
agreement by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

(c) Further Action. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the
Company Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company RSUs and Company PSUs
(collectively, the "Company Equity Awards") set forth in this Section 2.4(c).
Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume (A) the Company Equity
Awards in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.4 and (B) sponsorship of
the Company Stock Plan, provided that references to the Company shall
thereupon be deemed reference to Parent and references to Shares therein shall
be deemed references to Parent Common Stock with appropriate equitable
adjustments to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a Form S-8 (or file such other appropriate form)
registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill
Parent's obligations under this Section 2.4. Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery with respect to the Company Equity Awards
assumed by it in accordance with this Section 2.4.

2.5 No Dissenters' Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of the Shares in connection
with the Merger.

The Company represents and warrants to Parent as set forth in the statements
contained in this Article III except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents
filed and publicly available after January 1, 2017 but prior to the date of
this Agreement (the "Filed Company SEC Documents") (excluding any disclosures
in the Filed Company SEC Documents in any risk factors section, any forward-
looking disclosure in any section related to forward-looking statements and
other disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in nature, other than
historical facts included therein) or in the disclosure letter delivered by
the Company to Parent at or before the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"). The Company Disclosure Letter
shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article III, and the
disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
qualify other sections in this Article III to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or
applies to such other sections.

each of the Company's Subsidiaries (such Subsidiaries of the Company, the
"Company



Subsidiaries") is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good
standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in
the case of the Company Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite
power and authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to own,
operate, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the
failure to have such power or authority or to possess the Company Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available
to Parent, prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of
the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Company, dated as
of February 25, 2015 (the "Company Charter") and the amended and restated

(i) all the outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, each of the Company Subsidiaries and (ii) any

entity which interests are owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary have
been validly issued and are owned by the Company, by another Company
Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of
all material Liens, and free of any other restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock, voting securities or other equity interests), except for restrictions
imposed by applicable securities laws. Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and
complete list of the Company Subsidiaries.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or other entity
other than ordinary course investments in publicly traded securities
constituting one percent or less of a class of outstanding securities of any
entity.

3.3 Capital Structure.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 175,000,000 Shares
and 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the "Company

2018, no shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
From the close of business on September 5, 2018 to the date of this Agreement,
there have been no issuances by the Company of shares of capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company, other than
the issuance of Shares upon the vesting or settlement of Company RSUs or

any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, or any other obligation of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued by or other
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are linked in any
way to the price of any class of the capital stock of the Company or any
shares of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary, the value of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on any shares of capital
stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Other than (1) the withholding
of Shares to satisfy Tax obligations with respect to awards granted pursuant
to the Company Stock Plan and (2) the acquisition by the Company of awards
granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plan in connection with the forfeiture
of such awards, there are not any outstanding obligations of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of capital stock or voting securities or other equity



interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any securities,
interests, warrants, calls, options or other rights referred to in clause (x),
(y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote
(collectively, "Company Voting Debt"). Other than as contemplated by this
Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries nor any of
the Company's stockholders is a party to any voting agreement with respect to

entitled to elect, designate or nominate any director of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries.

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary or associates (as defined
in Section 203 of the DGCL) owns, or has owned at any time within the past
three (3) years, any shares of Parent Common Stock.

3.4 Corporate Authority and Approval.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company Board has adopted resolutions,
by unanimous vote at a meeting duly called, at which all directors of the
Company were present, and in support of the Company Board Recommendation and
directing that this Agreement be submitted to the Company's stockholders for
adoption. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been
amended or withdrawn.

(b) Except for the adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares with respect to the Merger
(the "Company Stockholder Approval"), no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as
applicable, this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as required
by the DGCL). The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except, in each
case, as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization
or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

(c) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board
have taken all action necessary to exempt each of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby under or thereunder, or make not subject, to (i) the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL, (ii) any other applicable "fair price", "moratorium",
"control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or similar
statute



or regulation or (iii) any provision of the organizational documents of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that would require any corporate approval
other than that otherwise required by the DGCL or other applicable state Law.
There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" antitakeover plan or
similar device in effect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, party or otherwise bound.

3.5 No Conflicts; Consents.

(a) Except as set forth on Section 3.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) conflict with, or result
in any violation of any provision of, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary (assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), (ii)
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation under, or give
rise to any obligation to make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness
or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of any Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets is bound or any Company Permit or (iii)
conflict with, or result in any violation of any provision of, subject to the
filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.5(b), any Judgment or Law,
in each case, applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their
respective properties or assets (assuming that the Company Stockholder
Approval is obtained), other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii)
above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (it
being agreed that for purposes of this Section 3.5(a), effects resulting from
or arising in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse
Effect", shall not be excluded in determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur to the
extent such effects were not otherwise excluded from determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected

extent such effects were not otherwise excluded from determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur) and would not prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder

3.6 Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements. No Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) The Company has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by Company with the
SEC since January 1, 2017 (such documents, together with any documents filed
with the SEC during such period by Company on a voluntary basis on a Current
Report on Form 8-K, being collectively referred to as the "Company SEC
Documents").

(b) Each Company SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and (ii) did not at the
time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior
to the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents complied at the time it was filed as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in the Company's consolidated
unaudited balance sheet as of June 29, 2018 (or the notes thereto) as included
in the Company SEC Documents, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
since June 29, 2018 in the ordinary



course of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred as
permitted by this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For
purposes of this Section 3.6, the term "liabilities" shall not include
liabilities or obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to perform
under or comply with any applicable Law, action, Judgment or Contract, but
would include such liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or
failure to perform or comply by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with any
such liability or obligation if such default or failure would, with the giving
of notice or passage of time or both, reasonably be expected to result in a
monetary obligation or the imposition of injunctive or other equitable
remedies

3.7 Internal Controls and Procedures.

(a) Each of the chief executive officer of the Company and the chief financial
officer of the Company (or each former chief executive officer of the Company
and each former chief financial officer of the Company, as applicable) has
made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Company SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer" and "chief
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. None of

arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

(b) The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial
reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (ii) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (iii) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Company's properties or assets.

(c) The Company is, and since January 1, 2017 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and requirements of the NYSE.

(d) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by the Company are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all
such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to
the management of the Company to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange
Act with respect to such reports.



(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Company's or such Company Subsidiary's published financial statements.

3.8 Absence of Certain Changes. From January 1, 2018 to the date of this
Agreement, there has not occurred any Effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. From January 1, 2018 to the date of this Agreement, except for
actions taken in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have conducted the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course in all material respects, and
during such period there have not been any actions taken that if taken after
the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent would
constitute a violation of Section 5.1(a) (other than clauses (i)(A), (i)(B),
(ii), (iii)(A), (iv), (v) or (xiii) of Section 5.1(a)).

3.9 Litigation and Liabilities. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no

3.10 Benefits Matters; ERISA Compliance.

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Plan" shall mean any
benefit and compensation plan, policy, program or arrangement maintained,
sponsored or contributed to (or required to be contributed to) by the Company

retiree medical, profit sharing, pension, severance, change-in-control,
termination, restricted stock, stock option, stock appreciation rights or
stock based plans, programs, agreements or arrangements, excluding any
statutory plans (a "Statutory

in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies
of each of the material Company Plans (or, if unwritten, a written summary
thereof), and all amendments thereto, and to the extent applicable, any
related trust or other funding vehicle, and the most recent determination
letter or opinion letter received from or issued by the IRS with respect to
each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, have been
provided or made available to Parent on or prior to the date of this
Agreement.

(b) All Company Plans are in compliance with their terms and applicable Laws

likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") and, to the Knowledge of the Company, circumstances do not
exist that are likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
each non-U.S. Company Plan, to the extent required to be registered or
approved by any Governmental Entity, has been registered with, or approved by,
such Governmental Entity and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred that would adversely affect such registration or approval.

(d) Except as set forth on Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

likely to result in a material liability to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, taken as a whole, with respect to each Company Plan that is
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the
Code: (i) no Company Plan has failed to satisfy the minimum funding standard
(within the meaning of Sections 412 and 430 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) applicable to such Company Plan, whether or not waived and no
application for a waiver of the minimum funding standard with respect to any
Company Plan has been submitted; (ii) no reportable event within the meaning
of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the thirty (30)-day notice requirement
has not been waived has occurred; (iii) no material liability (other than for
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC")) under Title
IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary; (iv) the



PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan or made any
inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead to termination of any such
plan, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents
a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute
grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment
of a trustee to administer, any such plan; and (v) no plan is, or is expected
to be, in "at-risk" status (as defined in Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or
Section 430(i)(4) of the Code).

Subsidiary under each Company Plan and each Statutory Plan have been timely
made and all obligations in respect of each Company Plan have been properly

Knowledge of the Company, threatened proceedings relating to the Company
Plans, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as required by
applicable Law or as set forth on Section 3.10(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would reasonably be
expected to, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) result
in any material payment becoming due to any employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) materially increase the amount or
value of any compensation or benefits under any Company Plan or otherwise
payable to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting

parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) becoming
due to any current or former employee, officer, individual independent
contractor or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as set
forth on Section 3.10(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or
otherwise reimburse any current or former employee, director or other
independent contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any excise

Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

(i) Except as set forth on Section 3.10(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter,

in a material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary taken as a
whole.

Compensation Appeals Board, or any other Governmental Entity against the

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to, or issued in
violation of, any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,
preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision
of the DGCL, the Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws, any Contract to which
Parent is a party or otherwise bound, or applicable Law. The shares of Parent

than as contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of the Parent
Subsidiaries is a party to any (i) voting agreement with respect to the voting

Parent or (ii) agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect,
designate or nominate any director of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries.

(c) As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary owns any
Shares.

4.4 Corporate Authority and Approval.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject, with respect to
Parent, to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval and, with respect to
Merger Sub, the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its capacity as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, to perform its obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parent Board has



unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and in the

have not been amended or withdrawn.

(b) Except for the approval of the Parent Share Issuance by the affirmative
vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock, present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, at the
Parent Stockholders Meeting (such approval, the "Parent Stockholder
Approval"), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary
to authorize, adopt, or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (except for the filing of the
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). Parent and Merger Sub
have duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against
Parent, in accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement may
be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

4.5 No Conflicts; Consents.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub does
not, and the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their respective
obligations hereunder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any violation of any

stockholder of Merger Sub, adopts this Agreement), (ii) conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or

Approval is obtained and that Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, adopts this Agreement), other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii) above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.5(a), effects
resulting from or arising in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, as set



forth in clause (iv) of the definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect",
shall not be excluded in determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect
has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur to the extent such

Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) No Consent of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing made

definition of the term "Material Adverse Effect", shall not be excluded in
determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
reasonably be expected to occur to the extent such effects were not otherwise
excluded from determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur) and would not prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

4.6 Parent SEC Documents; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) Parent has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements
and other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be furnished or filed by Parent with the SEC since
January 1, 2017 (such documents, together with any documents filed with the
SEC during such period by Parent on a voluntary basis on a Current Report on
Form 8-K, but excluding the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4, being
collectively referred to as the "Parent SEC Documents").



(b) Each Parent SEC Document (i) at the time filed, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of SOX and the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Document and (ii) did not at the time
it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to
the date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of Parent
included in the Parent SEC Documents complied at the time it was filed as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in Parent's consolidated
unaudited balance sheet as of May 4, 2018 (or the notes thereto) as included
in the Parent SEC Documents, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
since May 4, 2018 in the ordinary course of business and (iii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred as permitted by this Agreement, neither Parent nor
any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in
the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Section 4.6, the term
"liabilities" shall not include liabilities or obligations of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to perform under or comply with any applicable Law, action,
Judgment or Contract, but would include such liabilities and obligations if
there has been a default or failure to perform or comply by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary with any such liability or obligation if such default or
failure would, with the giving of notice or passage of time or both,
reasonably be expected to result in a monetary obligation or the imposition of
injunctive or other equitable remedies.

4.7 Internal Controls and Procedures.

(a) Each of the chief executive officer of Parent and the chief financial
officer of Parent (or each former chief executive officer of Parent and each
former chief financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the Parent SEC Documents,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For
purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer" and "chief financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. None of Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within
the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.



(b) Parent maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting"
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parent's properties or assets.

(c) Parent is, and since January 1, 2017 has been, in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and requirements of the NYSE.

(d) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are reasonably designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Parent to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Parent to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

(e) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
the Parent Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries in Parent's or such Parent Subsidiary's published
financial statements.

4.8 Absence of Certain Changes. From January 1, 2018 to the date of this
Agreement, there has not occurred any Effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. From January 1, 2018 to the date of this Agreement, except for
actions taken in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have conducted the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries
in the ordinary course in all material respects.

4.9 Litigation and Liabilities. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no
suit, action or other proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date of this Agreement, there is no Judgment outstanding against or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental Entity involving Parent
or any Parent



Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

4.10 Benefits Matters; ERISA Compliance.

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Parent Plan" shall mean any
benefit and compensation plan, policy, program or arrangement maintained,
sponsored or contributed to (or required to be contributed to) by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary or under which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any
liability covering or for the benefit of any current or former employees of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any current or former directors of Parent
or Parent Subsidiary, including "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, and any incentive and bonus, deferred compensation,

the Parent Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of each of the material
Parent Plans (or, if unwritten, a written summary thereof), and all amendments
thereto, and to the extent applicable, any related trust or other funding
vehicle, and the most recent determination letter or opinion letter received
from or issued by the IRS with respect to each Parent Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401 of the Code, have been provided or made available to the
Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) All Parent Plans are in compliance with their terms and applicable Laws
(including, if applicable, ERISA and the Code), and Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have complied with all Statutory Plans in accordance with their
terms and applicable Law, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, circumstances do not exist that are likely to result in
the loss of the qualification of such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each non-U.S. Parent Plan to the extent
required to be registered or approved by any Governmental Entity, has been
registered with, or approved by, such Governmental Entity and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, nothing has occurred that would adversely affect such
registration or approval.

(d) Except as set forth on Section 4.10(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,

"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section (3)(37) of ERISA), (ii) a
"multiple



employer plan" as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code or (iii) a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA.

(e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to result in a material liability to the Parent or any Parent

to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) no
Parent Plan has failed to satisfy the minimum funding standard (within the
meaning of Sections 412 and 430 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA)
applicable to such Parent Plan, whether or not waived and no application for a
waiver of the minimum funding standard with respect to any Parent Plan has
been submitted; (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c)
of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived has
occurred; (iii) no material liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC)
under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary; (iv) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such plan or made any inquiry which would reasonably be expected
to lead to termination of any such plan, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted
or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such plan;
and (v) no plan is, or is expected to be, in "at-risk" status (as defined in
Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4) of the Code).

under each Parent Plan and each Statutory Plan have been timely made and all
obligations in respect of each Parent Plan have been properly accrued and

reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(g) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened proceedings relating to the Parent Plans,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, as required by
applicable Law or as set forth on Section 4.10(h) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would reasonably be
expected to, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) result
in any material payment becoming due to any employee, officer or director of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) materially increase the amount or value
of any compensation or benefits under any Parent Plan or otherwise payable to
any employee, officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any
such compensation or benefits, or (iv) result in any "excess parachute

current or former employee, officer, individual independent contractor or
director Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Except as set forth on Section
4.10(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse

Parent or any Parent



Subsidiary for any excise or additional tax, interest or penalties incurred by
such individual under Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

Compensation Appeals Board, or any other Governmental Entity against the

parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against
Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto (in
each case, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights, or by principles governing the availability of equitable remedies) and
(z) in full force and effect. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under
the Commitment Papers. The only conditions precedent (including any market
"flex" provisions contained in the Commitment Papers) related to the
obligations of the Financing Sources under the Commitment Papers to fund the
full amount of the Financing are those expressly set forth in the Commitment
Papers and there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources
to reduce the total amount of the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis all of the terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the Commitment
Papers on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have Knowledge that
any of the Financing Sources will not perform its obligations thereunder. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the
Commitment Papers that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
amount, availability, enforceability or conditionality of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Papers. Parent has paid in full any and all
commitment fees or other fees that are required to be paid on or before the
date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Papers. In no
event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent or any of its Affiliates
or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent's
obligations under this Agreement.

4.28 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Article IV, Parent
and Merger Sub are not making and have not made, and no other Person is making
or has made on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, any express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

5.2 Company Acquisition Proposal.

(a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VII, except as expressly permitted by
this Section 5.2, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and
the Company shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' directors, officers and
employees not to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors,
agents or representatives (collectively, along with such directors, officers
and employees, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly induce, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations or cooperate in any way
not permitted by this Section 5.2 with any Person regarding any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Company Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) provide any information or data concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Company Acquisition Proposal; or

(iv) approve or recommend, make any public statement approving or
recommending, or enter into any agreement relating to, any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Company Acquisition Proposal.

The Company shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions and negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or proposal that would



reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal, and shall
promptly terminate access by any such Person to any physical or electronic
data rooms relating to any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall take all actions necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of
any "standstill" agreement between the Company and any Person (other than
Parent), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or
modification to, any such agreement, to permit such person to submit a Company
Acquisition Proposal; provided that the foregoing shall not restrict the
Company from permitting a Person to orally and non-publicly request the waiver
of a "standstill" or similar obligation or from granting such a waiver, in
each case, to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

(b) Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 5.2(a), prior to the time, but not after, the
Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal (which Company
Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement) which did not
result from a breach, in any material respect, of this Section 5.2 and so long
as it has provided prior written notice to Parent, (i) provide access to non-
public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Person who made such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is provided to
Parent substantially concurrently with the making of such information
available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any such material non-
public information, the Company receives from the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least
as restrictive on such Person as the Confidentiality Agreement's terms are on
Parent (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
prohibit the making or amending of a Company Acquisition Proposal), and (ii)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, prior to taking
any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines
in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on
the information then available and after consultation with a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation that such Company Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) Notice. The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day) notify Parent if (i) any written or other inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries,
proposals, offers or requests for information relating to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal are received
by the Company, (ii) any non-public information is requested in connection
with any Company Acquisition Proposal from the Company or (iii) any
discussions or negotiation with respect to or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated
or continued with the Company, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers



(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements and other material written
communications), and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current
basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including by promptly providing copies of any additional requests, proposals
or offers, including any drafts of proposed agreements and any amendments
thereto.

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

"Company Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal (other than a proposal or
offer by Parent or any of its subsidiaries) for (i) any merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, issuance of securities, direct or
indirect acquisition of securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange

securities of the Company; or (y) the Company issues securities representing
more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of any class of

Company; or (y) more than twenty percent (20%) of the fair market value of the
assets of the Company; or (iii) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

"Company Intervening Event" means any event, occurrence, fact, condition,
change, development or effect occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (i) was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company

Intervening Event to the extent otherwise satisfying this definition).

"Company Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, binding, written Company
Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Company
Acquisition Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) on terms which the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i)
more favorable to the holders of Shares (solely in their capacity as such)
than the Merger (taking into account all of the terms and conditions of, and
the likelihood of completion of, such proposal and this Agreement (including
any changes to the terms of this



Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise, including
termination or break-up fees and conditions to consummation contained herein))
and (ii) reasonably likely of being completed in accordance with its terms.

Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or

contemplated by this Agreement (a "Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement"); or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend or enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(f) Fiduciary Exception to No Company Change in Recommendation Provision.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.2(e),
following receipt of an unsolicited, written Company Acquisition Proposal by
the Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
material breach of this Section 5.2 and with respect to which the Company has
received a written, definitive form of Company Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, and the Company Board determining in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may, at any time prior to the time the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a Company Change in Recommendation with
respect to such Company Superior Proposal, if all of the following conditions
are met:

(i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with the
provisions of this Section 5.2 and shall have (A) provided to Parent three (3)
Business Days' prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it
has received a written Company Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Company
Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the
identity of the Person or group making the Company Acquisition Proposal), and
shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Company
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents related to the
Company Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Company
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and an additional two



(2) Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the
Company Board has determined to effect a Company Change in Recommendation, and
(B) prior to making such a Company Change in Recommendation, (x) engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to engage)
during such notice period to consider adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement which may be proposed in writing by Parent such that the
Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal, and (y) in determining whether to make a Company Change in
Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Superior Proposal and
taking into account any revised terms proposed in writing by Parent, such
Company Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
and, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such Company Change in Recommendation, would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) Company Change in Recommendation Due to Company Intervening Event.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.2(e), upon the
occurrence of any Company Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any
time prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a
Company Change in Recommendation, if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent three (3) Business Days'
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Company Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Company Change in Recommendation, and (2) state expressly that, subject to
clause (ii) below, the Company Board has determined to effect a Company Change
in Recommendation and (B) prior to making such a Company Change in
Recommendation, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent
Parent wishes to engage) during such three (3) Business Day period to consider
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement which may be
proposed in writing by Parent in such a manner that the failure of the Company
Board to make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to the Company
Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that in light of such Company Intervening Event and taking into
account any revised terms proposed in writing by Parent, the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation, would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(h) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under



applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Company Acquisition
Proposal; provided that any "stop look and listen" communication to its
stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
shall include an affirmative statement to the effect that the recommendation
of the Company Board is affirmed or remains unchanged; provided, further, that
this Section 5.2(h) shall not be deemed to permit the Company or the Company
Board to effect a Company Change in Recommendation except in accordance with
Sections 5.2(f) or 5.2(g). The Company shall not submit to the vote of its
stockholders any Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Superior Proposal
prior to the termination of this Agreement.

5.3 Parent Acquisition Proposal.

(a) No Solicitation or Negotiation. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VII, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and Parent shall cause its and its Subsidiaries'
directors, officers and employees not to, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly induce, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Parent Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations or cooperate in any way
not permitted by this Section 5.3 with any Person regarding any proposal the
consummation of which would constitute a Parent Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) provide any information or data concerning Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with any proposal the consummation of
which would constitute a Parent Acquisition Proposal;

(iv) approve or recommend, make any public statement approving or
recommending, or enter into any agreement relating to, any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Parent Acquisition Proposal.

Parent shall, and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Acquisition
Proposal, or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Fiduciary Exception to No Solicitation Provision. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in Section 5.3(a), Parent may, in response to an unsolicited,
bona fide written Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal (which Permitted
Parent Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement) which
did not result from a breach, in any material respect, of this Section 5.3 and
so long as it has provided prior written notice to the Company, (i) provide
access to non-public information regarding Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
to the Person who made such Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage
or participate in any



discussions or negotiations with any such Person regarding such Permitted
Parent Acquisition Proposal and (iii) cause or permit Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement, lease agreement or
other agreement relating to such Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal;
provided, that prior to taking any of the actions described in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) the Parent shall obtain a "standstill" agreement from the Person
who made such Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal that prohibits the making
of any Parent Acquisition Proposal that does not constitute a Permitted Parent
Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any
proposal was but ceased to be a Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal as a
result of it no longer being conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or
otherwise contemplates or requires Parent to abandon, terminate, delay,
modify, renegotiate or fail to consummate the Merger, Parent shall immediately
cease taking any actions described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the
foregoing sentence and shall promptly terminate access by any such Person to
any physical or electronic data rooms relating to Parent. Parent shall take
all actions necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of any
"standstill" agreement between Parent and any Person (other than the Company),
and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification
to, any such agreement, to permit such person to submit a proposal that is not
a Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Notice. Parent shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business
Day) notify the Company if (i) any written or other inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries,
proposals, offers or requests for information relating to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal are received
by Parent, (ii) any non-public information is requested in connection with any
Parent Acquisition Proposal from Parent or (iii) any discussions or
negotiation with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with
Parent, and thereafter shall keep the Company informed, on a current basis, of
the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

"Parent Intervening Event" means any event, occurrence, fact, condition,
change, development or effect occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement, including without limitation a Parent Acquisition Proposal that (i)
was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Parent Board prior to the

Intervening Event to the extent otherwise satisfying this definition), or (C)
a Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal.

"Permitted Parent Acquisition Proposal" means a Parent Acquisition Proposal
that, when made and at all times thereafter, expressly requires, as a
condition to the consummation of such Parent Acquisition Proposal either (i)
the prior consummation of the Merger or (ii) the termination of this Agreement
as a result of the Company Stockholder Approval not being obtained.

(e) No Parent Change in Recommendation. Except as provided in Section 5.3(f),

Board Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (or
publicly propose or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare

(ii) cause or permit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, lease agreement or other agreement relating
to any Parent Acquisition Proposal that is not a Permitted Parent Acquisition

terminate, delay, modify, renegotiate or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Parent Change in Recommendation Due to Parent Intervening Event.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.3(e), upon the
occurrence of any Parent Intervening Event, that did not result from a
material breach of this Section 5.3, the Parent Board may, at any time prior
to the time the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, make a Parent Change
in Recommendation, if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) Parent shall have (A) provided to the Company three (3) Business Days'
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Parent Intervening Event and the rationale for the
Parent Change in Recommendation, as the case may be, and (2) state expressly
that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Parent Board has



determined to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation and (B) prior to making
such a Parent Change in Recommendation, engaged in good faith negotiations
with the Company (to the extent the Company wishes to engage) during such
three (3) Business Day period to consider adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement which may be proposed in writing by the Company
in such a manner that the failure of the Parent Board to make a Parent Change
in Recommendation in response to the Parent Intervening Event in accordance
with clause (ii) below would no longer reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(ii) The Parent Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation, that in light of such Parent Intervening Event and taking into
account any revised terms proposed in writing by the Company, the failure to
make a Parent Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall
be deemed to prohibit Parent from complying with its disclosure obligations
under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal; provided that any "stop look and listen" communication to its
stockholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act
shall include an affirmative statement to the effect that the recommendation
of the Parent Board is affirmed or remains unchanged; provided, further, that
this Section 5.3(g) shall not be deemed to permit Parent or the Parent Board
to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation, except in accordance with Section
5.3(f).



5.4 Information Supplied. (a) The Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and
cause to be filed with the SEC a joint proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus") with
respect to the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare (with the Company's reasonable cooperation) and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the "Form S-4"), in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under
the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent
to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Shares and
Parent and the holders of the capital stock of Parent, as applicable, as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company's stockholders and Parent's
stockholders, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act.

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus will be made by the Company or Parent, in each case
without providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (other than, in each case, any filing, amendment or supplement
in connection with a Company Change in Recommendation or a Parent Change in
Recommendation, as applicable), and each Party shall consider in good faith
all comments reasonably proposed by the other Party. Each of the Company and
Parent shall promptly provide the other with copies of all such filings,
amendments or supplements to the extent not publicly available. Each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person and
its Affiliates to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by such other Party to be included therein and shall
otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the other in the preparation of
the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus, as applicable, and the
resolution of any comments to either received from the SEC. If at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent
Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or Parent, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of



the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as applicable. The Parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to the Form S-4, Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus or
the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the Form S-4. No
response to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC relating to the
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus will be made by either Party without
providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC, and each Party shall
consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other Party.
The Parties will cause the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

5.5 Company and Parent Stockholder Meetings.

(a) Company Stockholders Meeting.

(i) The Company will, as promptly as practicable in accordance with applicable
Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, establish a record date for,
duly call and give notice of, and use its reasonable best efforts to convene a
meeting of holders of Shares to consider and vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.2, the Company Board shall include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus and recommend at the Company
Stockholders Meeting that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such adoption.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if on or before the date on which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company reasonably believes
that (i) it will not receive proxies representing the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present or (ii) it will not have enough
Shares represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company may (and, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall) postpone or adjourn, or make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of, the Company Stockholders Meeting and (y) the
Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure that the Company has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by stockholders of the Company prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, as long as the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of thirty (30) calendar days in
connection with any such postponements or adjournments pursuant to either or
both of the preceding clauses (x) and (y).

(ii) Notwithstanding any Company Change in Recommendation, the Company shall
submit this Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Company

Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VII prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only
matter (other than matters of procedure and matters required by Law to be
voted on by the Company's stockholders in connection with the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

(b) Parent Stockholders Meeting.

(i) Parent will, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Charter and
Parent Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call and give notice of, and
use its reasonable best efforts to convene and hold a meeting of holders of
capital stock of Parent to consider and vote upon the Parent Share Issuance as
promptly as practicable. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.3, the Parent
Board shall include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus and recommend at the Parent Stockholders Meeting that
the holders of capital stock of Parent approve the Parent Share Issuance and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and solicit such approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if on or before the date on which the
Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, Parent reasonably believes that (A)
it will not receive proxies representing the Parent Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, or (B) it will not have enough shares of
Parent Common Stock represented to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
the business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, Parent may (and, if requested
by the Company, Parent shall) postpone or adjourn, or make one or more
successive postponements or adjournments of, the Parent Stockholders Meeting
and (y) Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing or mailing of any supplemental
or amended disclosure that Parent has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to be required under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
as long as the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned more than an aggregate of thirty (30) calendar days in connection
with any such postponements or adjournments pursuant to either or both of the
preceding clauses (x) and (y).

(ii) Notwithstanding any Parent Change in Recommendation, Parent shall seek
the Parent Stockholder Approval at the Parent Stockholders Meeting unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII prior to the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the
Parent Share Issuance shall be the only matter (other than matters of
procedure and matters required by Law to be voted on by Parent's stockholders
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) that Parent shall
propose to be acted on by the stockholders of Parent at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting.

5.6 Filings; Other Actions; Notification.

(a) The Company and Parent shall, subject to Sections 5.2 and 5.3, cooperate
with each other and use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use,
their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable
under this Agreement and applicable Laws and Orders to



consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as possible, including (i)
preparing and filing all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings (and in any event, by filing within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement the notifications, filings and
other information required to be filed under the HSR Act and to obtain as
expeditiously as possible all Consents, expirations of waiting periods and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) satisfying the
conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) defending any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (iv) obtaining (and cooperating
with each other in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any
exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent
necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the Merger and (v) executing
and delivering any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall pay the HSR filing
fee owed by Parent and any foreign filing fee owed by the Company or Parent.

(b) Subject to Section 5.6(c), in the event that the Parties receive a request
for information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws (a "Second Request"), unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to submit an
appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second Request
as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both Parties will closely
cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review process.
Neither Party shall agree to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement with any Governmental
Entity to delay the transactions contemplated hereby except with prior written
consent of the other Party. None of the Parties shall knowingly take, cause or
permit to be taken or omit to take any action which such Party reasonably
expects is likely to materially delay or prevent consummation of the
contemplated transactions, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with respect to the Antitrust Laws.
No Party or its counsel shall independently participate in any substantive
call or meeting relating to the Antitrust Laws with any Governmental Entity in
respect of such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving the
other Party or its counsel prior notice of such call or meeting and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. In furtherance of the foregoing and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) each Party shall notify the other, of any filing or
material or substantive communication or inquiry it or any of its Subsidiaries
intends to make with any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are
the subject of this Section 5.6, (ii) prior to submitting any such filing or
making any such communication or inquiry, such Party shall provide the other
Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review, and shall consider
in good faith the comments of the other Party in connection with, any such
filing, communication or inquiry, (iii) promptly following the submission of
such filing or making such communication or inquiry, provide the other Party
with a copy of any such filing or, if in written form, communication or
inquiry and (iv) consult with the other Party in connection with any inquiry,
hearing,



investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity
relating to the Merger, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning
for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. In exercising
the foregoing cooperation rights, the Company and Parent each shall act
reasonably and as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, materials provided pursuant to this Section 5.6 may be (x)
reasonably redacted (A) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Merger, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns, (D)
as necessary to remove competitively sensitive material, or (E) as otherwise
required by applicable Law or (y) provided to the other Party as "Outside
Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions pursuant to Section
5.7(c).

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 5.6, each of the Parties shall prepare and submit,
in a form acceptable to the cognizant security agency, to the Defense Security
Service ("DSS") of the United States Department of Defense a notification
under NISPOM and any other applicable national or industrial security
regulations, and any other applicable customer, national or industrial
security regulations or customer program security requirements; provided, that
each of Parent and the Company shall have approval rights over the content of
all related communications, filings and notifications and shall be entitled to
participate in all related discussions, where acceptable to the cognizant
security agency.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 5.6, each of the Parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted
by any Governmental Entity in connection with the HSR Act, any other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit
or proceeding, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this
Section 5.6, "reasonable best efforts" shall include taking any and all
actions necessary to obtain the Consents or waiting period expirations of any
Governmental Entity required to consummate the Merger prior to the Termination
Date, including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, effecting and
agreeing to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license, hold separate, and other disposition of the businesses,
assets, products or equity interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' other businesses, assets, products or equity
interests now owned or hereafter acquired by Parent, (ii) creating,
terminating, or amending any existing relationships, ventures, contractual
rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries,
(iii) otherwise taking or committing to any action that would limit Parent's
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly
or indirectly, any businesses, assets, products or equity interests of Parent
or the Company (including any of their respective Subsidiaries) and (iv)
making, or causing any Subsidiaries to make, any commitment, or committing to
(or causing any Subsidiaries to commit to) make any commitment (to any
Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding the future operations of Parent or
the Company (including any of their respective Subsidiaries) (the "Regulatory
Actions"); provided that Parent shall not be required to accept or agree to
any Regulatory Action that would result in,



or would be reasonably likely to result in, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect on Parent or on the Company.
"Regulatory Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to any Person, any
Effect, in each case resulting from or arising out of the matters contemplated
by this Section 5.6 that has a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, business, revenue or EBITDA of such Person and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole; provided that, for purposes of determining whether any
action, term or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect on Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries will
collectively be deemed to be a company the size of (and with revenue and
EBITDA equal to those of) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
provided, further, that, for purposes of determining whether any action, term
or condition would have or would reasonably be expected to have a Regulatory
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or on the Company, impacts on Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be aggregated. "EBITDA"
means, with respect to any Person, the sum of (1) consolidated net income,
determined in accordance with GAAP, plus (2) without duplication and to the
extent deducted in determining such consolidated net income, the sum of (I)
consolidated interest expense, (II) consolidated income tax expense and (III)
all amounts attributed to depreciation or amortization, in each case of such
Person and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 5.6 shall require Parent,
the Company or their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any
action with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of
such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger.

(g) Information. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other,
promptly furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Form S-4,
Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus and any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(h) Status. The Company and Parent each shall keep the other reasonably
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notice or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, other than immaterial communications.



5.7 Access; Consultation. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may
otherwise be required by applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford the other Party's
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to the other Party's, and each of its
Subsidiaries' employees, properties, assets, books, records and contracts and,
during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other all information
concerning its or any of its Subsidiaries' capital stock, business and
personnel as may reasonably be requested by the other; provided that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent; and provided,
further that the foregoing shall require neither the Company nor Parent to
permit any invasive environmental sampling or to disclose any information
pursuant to this Section 5.7 to the extent that (i) in the reasonable good
faith judgment of such Party, any applicable Law requires such Party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information, (ii) in the reasonable good faith judgment of such Party, the
information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party or
(iii) disclosure of any such information or document would result in the loss
of attorney-client privilege; provided, further that with respect to clauses
(i) through (iii) of this Section 5.7(a), Parent or the Company, as
applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain the
required consent of any such third party to provide such inspection or
disclosure, (2) develop an alternative to providing such information so as to
address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company
and (3) in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), implement appropriate and
mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a
manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by arrangement of
appropriate clean room procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint
defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided, if the
Parties determine that doing so would reasonably permit the disclosure of such
information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing such privilege.
Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of
the other Party. All requests for information made pursuant to this Section
5.7 shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, or such Person as may be designated by any such executive officer.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate competitively sensitive material provided to the other as
"Outside Counsel Only Material" or with similar restrictions. Such material
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
counsel of the recipient, or otherwise as the restriction indicates, and be
subject to any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement between
the Parties. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. To the extent that any of the
information or material furnished pursuant to this Section 5.7 or otherwise in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement may include material subject to
the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable
privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, the Parties understand and agree that they have a commonality
of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and
mutual understanding that the sharing of such material is not intended to,
and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, shall not, waive or



diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, remain entitled to
such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint
defense doctrine. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate in identifying any actions or practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that could require remediation under applicable Law
and, to the extent identified, shall cooperate in taking commercially
reasonable actions or practices and other customary actions to reduce the
risks related to such actions where the failure to remediate would reasonably
be likely to result in substantial fines or penalties.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to one another
upon obtaining Knowledge of any Effect that would reasonably be likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as applicable), or of any reasonably likely failure of any condition to
Parent's or the Company's obligations to effect the Merger (as applicable).

5.8 Stock Exchange Listing, De-listing and De-registration. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to permit the Shares and any other security issued
by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and listed on the NYSE to be de-
listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
possible following the Effective Time.

5.9 Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall consult with each other prior to
issuing or making, and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on, any press releases or other public announcements with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any filings with any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange) with respect thereto, except (a) as may be required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange, (b) any consultation that would not be
reasonably practicable as a result of requirements of applicable Law, (c) any
press release or public statement that in the good faith judgment of the
applicable Party is consistent with prior press releases issued or public
statements made in compliance with this Section 5.9 or (d) with respect to any
Company Change in Recommendation or Parent Change in Recommendation made in
accordance with this Agreement or the other Party's response thereto.

5.10 Employee Benefits.

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
who continues to remain employed with the Company or its Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time (a "Continuing Employee") shall, during the
period commencing at the



Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2019 (the "Continuation Period"), be
provided with (i) an annual rate of base salary or base wage that is no less
favorable than the base salary or base wages provided to such Continuing
Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the target annual cash bonus opportunities
provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) long-term incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the long-term
incentive opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees
that Continuing Employees shall, during the Continuation Period, be provided
with pension, welfare and other employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, annual and long-term
incentive opportunities and equity-based compensation). Additionally, Parent
agrees that each Continuing Employee shall, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2019, be provided with severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee under the Company
Plans set forth on Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Company to honor the annual bonus obligations set
forth on Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Subject to Section
5.10(e), following the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Company to honor all Company Plans, in accordance with their terms.

(b) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Company to waive, or cause its
insurance carriers to waive, all pre-existing conditions, exclusions or
waiting periods that could otherwise apply to any Continuing Employee under
the benefit plans provided for such Continuing Employee following the Closing,
except to the extent such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods were
applicable to the Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time. With
respect to the plan year during which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for deductibles and out-of-pocket
requirements paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent plan in which such
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate following the Closing Date.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company to, provide credit to Continuing Employees for their service
recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, continuous service, determination of service
awards, vacation, paid time off, and severance entitlements to the same extent
and for the same purposes as such service was credited under the Company
Plans, provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

(d) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the ESPP to provide that with respect to any
offering periods in effect as of the date hereof (the "Current Purchase
Period"), (x) no employee who is not a participant in the ESPP as of the date
hereof may become a participant in the ESPP, and (y) each individual



participating in the Current Purchase Period in progress on the date of this
Agreement will not be permitted to increase his or her payroll contribution
rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Law. In
addition, (i) the Current Purchase Period will end on December 31, 2018;
provided that if the Effective Time is prior to December 31, 2018, the Company
will end the Current Purchase Period on a specified trading day occurring at
least ten (10) days prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (ii)
there will be no offering periods following the Current Purchase Period and
(iii) in all events, the Company shall terminate the ESPP prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) If Parent so requests (which request shall be made not less than forty-
five (45) days prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall take any and
all actions required (including, without limitation, the adoption of
resolutions by the Company Board of Directors) to amend, suspend or terminate
any or all Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent
such actions are permitted by Law (including any required prior notice
obligations), the terms of this Section 5.10, or the terms of the applicable
plan; provided that any amendment, suspension or termination of any Company
Plan shall not impact the benefits required to be provided pursuant to Section
5.10(a).

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no other Person, including any current or
former employee, participant in any Company Plan or other dependent,
beneficiary or other individual associated therewith, is or shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (except to the
extent provided in Section 8.8), no provision of this Agreement is intended
to, or does, (i) constitute the establishment of, or an amendment to, any
Company Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their Affiliates, (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of
its Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan, any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) give any third party
any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.10, (iv) prevent Parent,
the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time,
from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee or (v) be deemed to
confer upon any such individual or legal representative any right to continued
employment or any rights under or with respect to any plan, program or
arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement, and each such
individual or legal representative shall be entitled to look only to the
express terms of any such plan, program or arrangement for his or her rights
thereunder.

5.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 7.5 and 7.6, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such
expense.

5.12 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable



and documented attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a
"proceeding") (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of the fact that such Indemnified
Party is or was a director or officer of the Company, or, while a director or
officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another Person prior to the Effective
Time, in each case, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
required to under Delaware Law, any applicable indemnification agreement to
which such Person is a party in effect as of the date of this Agreement, the
Company Charter or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement to
indemnify such Person (and the Surviving Company shall also advance expenses
as incurred by Indemnified Parties in defending any proceeding to the same
extent as such Indemnified Parties are entitled to advance of expenses as of
the date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the Company Charter, Company
Bylaw or any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is a
party; provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced shall provide an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification). Parent shall ensure that the
organizational documents of the Surviving Company shall, for a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors, officers, employees and agents of
the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Indemnified Party as provided herein.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers' liability
insurance, employment practices liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however that in no
event shall the Company expend for such policies an annual premium amount in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid
by the Company for such insurance provided, further that if the premium for
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Company shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or
merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then and in each such case proper
provisions shall be



made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent set forth in this Section 5.12.



(c) The provisions of this Section 5.12 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives. The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section
5.12 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have under
Delaware Law, any applicable indemnification agreement to which such Person is
a party, the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws.

(d) Neither of Parent or the Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual proceeding
for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such
proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to such settlement,
compromise or consent.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 5.12 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

5.13 Takeover Statute. The Company and the Company Board and Parent and the
Parent Board shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to (x) take
all action reasonably appropriate to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably appropriate to
ensure that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

5.14 Control of the Company's or Parent's Operations. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly,
rights to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision of its operations.

5.15 Section 16(b). The board of directors of each of the Company and Parent
(or, in each case, a duly authorized committee thereof) shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take all such actions within its control as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause the transactions



contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities
of the Company and acquisitions of equity securities of Parent (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is a director or executive officer of
the Company or is or may become a director or executive officer of Parent in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.16 Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub. Immediately following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, shall adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger,
in accordance with Delaware Law, by written consent.

5.17 Stockholder Litigation. Each Party shall notify the other Party, in
writing and promptly after acquiring knowledge thereof, of any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby that is brought against or, to the Knowledge of such Party, threatened
against, such Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
or officers and shall keep the other Party informed on a reasonably current
basis with respect to the status thereof. The Parties agree to cooperate in
the defense and settlement of any such litigation, and the Company shall not
settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting in any way
the Parties' obligations under Section 5.6, each of the Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the
defense or settlement of any litigation contemplated by this Section 5.17.

5.18 Tax Treatment.

(a) The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and cooperate with one another in obtaining an opinion from
Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP ("Company's Counsel") or Morrison and Foerster, LLC
("Parent's Counsel"), as provided for in Section 6.3(d), and neither shall
take any action (or fail to take any action) that is reasonably likely to
prevent or impede such qualification. Parent will report the Merger in a
manner consistent with such qualification.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall deliver to the Company's Counsel and
Parent's counsel at such time or times as requested by the Company's Counsel
or Parent's Counsel letters signed by an officer thereof and containing
representations substantially in the form of Exhibits B and C hereto,
respectively, for the purposes of obtaining a tax opinion from the Company's
Counsel to the effect that the Merger will be treated for U.S. federal income
tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

5.19 Directorship. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
board of directors of Parent to consist of eleven (11) members. Parent shall
appoint two (2) individuals who are currently members of the Company Board to
serve on the board of directors of Parent, to be mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company.



5.20 Financing.

(a) Parent shall use its, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to use
their, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and subject only to the
conditions (including the market "flex" provisions) set forth in the
Commitment Papers contemporaneously with the Closing, including by using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Papers, (ii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing
(the "Definitive Agreements") consistent with the terms and conditions
contained in the Commitment Papers and (iii) satisfy on or prior to the
Closing Date all conditions in the Commitment Papers and the Definitive
Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder. In the event that all
conditions contained in the Commitment Papers or the Definitive Agreements
(other than the consummation of the Merger and other than those that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to in all material respects
enforce its rights under the Commitment Papers, including using reasonable
best efforts to cause the Lenders to comply with their respective obligations
thereunder, including to fund the Financing. Parent shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, permit any termination of or amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision
under, the Commitment Papers if such termination, amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
to an amount that, when combined with cash of the Parent, would not be
sufficient to consummate the Refinancing, (B) impose new or additional
conditions precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the
funding of the Financing, (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Papers or (D)
would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or
delay the funding of the Financing. Parent shall promptly deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of any amendment, modification, supplement,
consent or waiver to or under any Commitment Papers promptly upon execution
thereof.

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably prompt basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the
Company prompt written notice of (i) any actual or threatened breach, default,
termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Papers
and the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any breach, default, termination,
cancellation or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Papers, or (ii) the
occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the ability of Parent to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the Closing Date to the extent necessary to fund the Refinancing.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Company delivers to Parent a
written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence. If the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including any applicable market "flex" provisions) contemplated by
the Commitment Papers (other than solely as a result of Company's material



breach of any covenant in this Section 5.20), Parent shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, in replacement thereof
alternative financing (the "Alternative Financing") in an amount, when
combined with cash on hand of Parent, sufficient to consummate the Refinancing
with terms and conditions (including market "flex" provisions) not less
favorable to Parent (or its Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Commitment Papers and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such
unavailability and the reason therefor. Upon any amendment, supplement,
modification, waiver or replacement of the Commitment Papers in accordance
with the terms hereof (including upon the execution of any commitment letter
or fee letter in respect of any Alternative Financing), the terms "Financing",
"Commitment Letter"; Fee Letter" and "Commitment Papers" shall mean the
applicable Financing, Commitment Letters, Fee Letters and Commitment Papers as
so amended, supplemented, modified, waived or replaced, and Parent shall
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of the alternative debt
financing letters (including fee letters that shall have fee or related
information redacted in a manner consistent with the Fee Letter delivered as
of the date of this Agreement). The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by
Parent with this Section 5.20 shall not relieve Parent of its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Financing is available.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective officers, employees and advisors to provide, to
Parent, at Parent's sole cost and expense, such reasonable cooperation as is
customary and reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to:

(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable, furnish Parent with the Required
Information;

(ii) upon reasonable advance notice, cause senior management of the Company to
participate in a reasonable number of investor and lender meetings and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing at reasonable
times and locations mutually agreed, and assist Parent in obtaining ratings in
connection with the Financing;

(iii) assist Parent with the preparation by Parent and the Lender Related
Parties of, and use reasonable best efforts to provide, customary information
about the Company necessary for the preparation of, materials for rating
agency presentations, bank information memoranda, lender presentations,
syndication memoranda and similar marketing materials, memoranda or documents,
and due diligence memoranda and schedules to definitive financing
documentation, in each case to the extent, and solely to the extent, such
materials relate to information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries;

(iv) execute and deliver as of (but not prior to) the Closing any pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided
that (A) none of the documents or certificates shall be executed or delivered
except in connection with the Closing (except for customary "authorization
letters", authorizing, among other things, the distribution of information to
prospective lenders and identifying, among other things, any portion of such



information that constitutes material, non-public information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries or their respective securities, which shall be
executed by an officer of the Company prior to Closing), (B) the effectiveness
thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence
of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be imposed on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or employees involved
prior to the Closing Date); and otherwise reasonably facilitate the pledging
of collateral;

(v) subject to Section 5.20(d), cause the taking of corporate and other
actions by the Company and its Subsidiaries that are reasonably necessary to
permit the consummation of the Financing on the Closing Date and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to Parent as of the Closing; it being
understood and agreed that (A) no such corporate or other action will take
effect prior to the Closing and (B) any such corporate or other action will
only be required of the directors, members, partners, managers or officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who retain their respective positions as of
the Closing;

(vi) provide, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, all
documentation and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries as
is reasonably required under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, in each case
to the extent requested at least ten (10) Business Days in advance of the
Closing;

(vii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, inform Parent if the Company or
its Subsidiaries shall have actual knowledge of any facts that (x) require the
restatement of any financial statements comprising a portion of the Required
Information in order for such financial statements to comply with GAAP or (y)
result in any of the Required Information no longer being Compliant; and

(viii) prior to or at, and conditioned upon, the occurrence of the Closing,
deliver all notices and take all other actions required to facilitate (i) the
termination of commitments (if any) under the Existing Company Credit
Agreement, the repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding
thereunder, if any, and the release of all Liens in connection therewith, if
any, on the Closing Date, and deliver to Parent prior to the Closing Date a
customary payoff letter in respect of the Existing Company Credit Agreement or
such termination or other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Lender Related Parties, which payoff letter or other documents shall (A)
indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal,
interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or other similar
obligations related to the Existing Company Credit Agreement as of the Closing
Date (the "Payoff Amount") and (B) state that all obligations (including
guarantees) in respect thereof (other than those contingent indemnification
obligations that customarily remain following termination of a credit
agreement) and Liens in connection therewith on the assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be, substantially concurrently with the receipt
of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, released or arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to Parent for such release shall have been made by such time and
(ii) the satisfaction and discharge of that certain Indenture dated August 12,
2016 (the "Indenture") relating to the 8.875% Senior Notes



due 2024, by and among the Company, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
trustee, and the other parties thereto, in accordance with Article Four of the
Indenture.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of such requested
cooperation provided in accordance with this Section 5.20 shall unreasonably
interfere with the normal business or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to (i) bear any expense, pay any commitment or other fee, enter into
any definitive agreement, incur any other liability, make any other payment,
be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing
in each case prior to the Effective Time or (ii) take any action to cause any
condition to Closing set forth in this Agreement to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement that would provide Parent or
Merger Sub the right to terminate this Agreement or seek indemnity under the
terms hereof. In addition, nothing in this Section 5.20 shall require (u)
access to or disclosure of information that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) the preparation of any financial
statements or information that (1) are not available to it and prepared in the
ordinary course of its financial reporting practice or (2) would not otherwise
be available to it or capable of being prepared by it without undue burden or
other than with the use of its reasonable best efforts, (w) any action that
would conflict with or violate the Company Charter, Company Bylaws or any Law
or result in, prior to the Effective Time, the contravention of, or that would
reasonably be expected to result in, prior to the Effective Time, a violation
or breach of, or default under, any Company Material Contract, (x) any
employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
incurring any personal liability (as opposed to liability in his or her
capacity as an officer of such Person) with respect to any matters related to
the Financing, (y) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective boards of directors (or equivalent bodies) to approve or authorize
the Financing or any documentation related thereto, prior to the Effective
Time or (z) the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their counsel to provide
any legal opinion in connection with the Financing. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors (with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company) or
employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement
with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (except
for customary "authorization letters", authorizing, among other things, the

7.7 Effect of Termination and Abandonment. (a) In the event of termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VII,
this Agreement (other than as set forth in this Section 7.7 and in Section
8.1) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any
Party (or of any of its respective Representatives); provided that no such
termination shall relieve any Party (1) from any liability for fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination or (2) from any
obligation to pay, if applicable, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent
Expenses pursuant to Section 7.5 or Parent Termination Fee, or the Company
Expenses pursuant to Section 7.6. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Willful Breach" means a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, taken
or not taken with the actual knowledge that such act or failure to act would,
or would reasonably be expected to, result in or constitute a material breach
of this Agreement, regardless of whether breaching was the object of the act
or failure to act. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that any failure by Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement on the date the Closing should have occurred as a result of
Parent's failure to obtain the Financing sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement when all of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject
to the fulfillment or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of
those conditions) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement on or prior to such date, shall be deemed to be a Willful Breach of
this Agreement by Parent for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.7
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, no Party would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly the amount due
pursuant to Section 7.5 or Parent fails to pay promptly the amount due
pursuant to Section 7.6 (any such amount due, a "Payment"), and, in order to
obtain such Payment, the Party entitled to receive such Payment (the
"Recipient") commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Party
obligated to make such Payment (the "Payor") for the applicable Payment, or
any portion thereof, the Payor shall pay to the Recipient its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of the Payment at the prime rate in effect on the
date such Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of
full payment thereof.

(c) The Parties agree that the monetary remedies set forth in this Article VII
and the specific performance remedies set forth in Section 8.14 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of (i) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
against Parent, Merger Sub and any



of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, Financing Sources (including the Lender
Related Parties), Representatives or Affiliates for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated except in the case of
fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in which
case only Parent shall be liable for damages for such fraud or Willful
Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, managers, members, Financing Sources (including the Lender
Related Parties), Representatives or Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for the liability of
Parent in the case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation; and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, Representatives or
Affiliates for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated except in the
case of fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation (in
which case only the Company shall be liable for damages for such fraud or
Willful Breach), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, Representatives
or Affiliates shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the liability of the Company in the case of fraud or a
Willful Breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation.
