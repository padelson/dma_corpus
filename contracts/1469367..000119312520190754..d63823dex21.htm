serve process in accordance with this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9.13</U>, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, </P>
