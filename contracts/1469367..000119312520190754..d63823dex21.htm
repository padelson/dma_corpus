EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

 

OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

SECTION 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such share, a "
_Company Share_ ") (other than Company Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub, any
other wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior the
Effective Time, including Company Shares held in treasury by the Company, and
in each case not held on behalf of third parties (collectively, the "
_Cancelled Company Shares_ ")) shall be converted automatically into and
shall thereafter represent the right to receive a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Company Shares that have
been converted into a right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding, shall
be cancelled and extinguished automatically and shall cease to exist, and each
former holder of Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Shares, except for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Article II_.

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Company Shares_. Each Cancelled Company Share
shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without any conversion thereof or
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of_ _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Option_ ") under the Company Stock Plans shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into an option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a "
_Converted Option_ "), unless otherwise provided in (i) an agreement with the
Company to which the holder of such Company Option is a party or (ii) _
Schedule 2.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. For each Converted Option,
(i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Converted
Option shall be equal to the product (with the result rounded down to the
nearest whole share) of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option

 



-3- 

    

 immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (B) the Exchange
Ratio and (ii) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be
equal to the quotient (with the result rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
of (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Converted Options
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in the case of any Company
Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing sentence,
each such Converted Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
as applied to the corresponding Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a non-employee
director of the Company or current or former employee who will not be employed
by Parent or one of its Affiliates following the Closing (such directors and
employees, collectively the " _Non-Employees_ ") shall be canceled as of the
Effective Time, and converted into the right to receive (without interest), at
or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to (x) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) __ the excess, if
any, of the Per Share Cash Equivalent over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such Company Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment (after giving effect to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_ hereof). For the avoidance of doubt, any Company
Option held by a Non-Employee which has an exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Per Share Cash Equivalent
shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding restricted stock unit (a " _Company RSU_ ") under the Company
Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit denominated
in shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a restricted
stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Converted
RSU_ "), unless otherwise provided in (i) an agreement with the Company to
which the holder of such Company RSU is a party or (ii) _ Schedule 2.2(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such Converted RSU shall be equal to the product (with the
result rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company RSU as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as
expressly provided in the foregoing sentence, each Converted RSU shall remain
subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Company RSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a non-employee director of the Company shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time, and converted into the right to receive
(without interest), at or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in
cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_
(y) the Per Share Cash Equivalent, less applicable Taxes required to
be withheld with respect to such payment (after giving effect to _Section_ __
_ 2.3(e)_ hereof).

(c) _Treatment of Company PSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding performance-based restricted stock unit (a " _Company PSU_ ")
under the Company Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a performance-
based restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Company Common Stock and
shall be converted into a performance-based restricted stock unit denominated
in shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a " _Converted PSU_ "), unless
otherwise provided in (i) an agreement with the Company to which the holder of
such Company PSU is a party or (ii) _ Schedule 2.2(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such Converted PSU shall be equal to the product (with the result rounded
down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each such Company PSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time based on target performance levels _multiplied by_ (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. Except as expressly provided in the foregoing sentence, each
Converted PSU shall 

 



-4- 

    

 remain subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to the
corresponding Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company LTIP Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company LTIP Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, without any further action on the part of Parent or
the Company, be cancelled and terminated. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time and Parents filing of a Form S-8 registration statement
registering the remaining share reserves of the Vivint Solar, Inc. 2014 Equity
Incentive Plan, each holder of a cancelled Company LTIP Award shall be granted
a Replacement RSU Award with the following terms: (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to the Replacement RSU Award shall have a grant
date fair market value equal to the value of each holders LTIP Share,
calculated as if the Closing Date were a Determination Date upon which the
First Performance Hurdle and the Second Performance Hurdle were attained, with
such number of shares of Parent Common Stock rounded down to the nearest whole
share; (ii) the Replacement RSU Award shall vest, and the shares of Parent
Common Stock will be issued, in three equal installments, subject to the
grantees continued provision of services to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation through each of 30 days, nine months and 18 months following
the Closing Date; and (iii) the Replacement RSU Awards shall be subject to
the same restrictive covenants as the Company LTIP Awards (other than
adjustments necessary to reflect that Replacement RSU Awards will be granted
under the Vivint Solar, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, rather than the
Company LTIP Plans). Capitalized terms in this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ not
otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the
applicable Company LTIP Plan.

(e) _Company Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take all other actions necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(f) _Payment for Company Equity Awards_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent will transfer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
amounts owed to the holders of Company Options and Company RSUs that will be
settled in cash in accordance with _Sections 2.2(a)_ and _2.2(b)_ above.

 

(g) _Parent Corporate Actions_. Parent shall take all corporate actions that
are necessary for the treatment of the Company Options, Company RSUs, Company
PSUs and Company LTIP Awards pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, including
the reservation, issuance and listing of Parent Common Stock as necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Vivint Solar, Inc. 2014 Equity
Incentive Plan and entitled to grant stock awards, to the extent permissible
under applicable Law, using the remaining share reserves of the Vivint Solar,
Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan as of the Effective Time (including any shares
subsequently returned to such share reserves as a result of the termination
and forfeiture of Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs, Company LTIP
Awards and Replacement RSU Awards), except that: (i) shares covered by such
awards shall be shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) all references in the
Vivint Solar, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan to a number of shares
of Company Common Stock shall be deemed amended to refer instead to a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of
referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding
the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock; (iii) the compensation committee of Parents board of directors
shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Companys board of
directors or any committee thereof with respect to the administration of the
Vivint Solar, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan; and (iv) the Vivint Solar, Inc.
2014 Equity Incentive Plan shall be subject to administrative procedures
consistent with those in effect under Parents equity compensation plan. As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form) with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
underlying such Converted Options, Converted RSUs, Converted PSUs and
remaining share reserves of the Vivint Solar, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan
as of the Effective Time, and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
registration of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder continues to
be required.

SECTION 2.3 _Surrender of Company Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
enter into an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company with an exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection
with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, (1) certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form
representing the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and (2) cash in an
amount equal to at least the aggregate amount of cash payable in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_
to provide all shares of Parent Common Stock and funds necessary for the
Exchange Agent to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange
for all of the Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than the Cancelled Company Shares) (such shares and cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") in trust for the benefit
of the holders of the Company Shares that will be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash deposited in the Exchange
Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall
be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds
having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized
credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the
foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three months. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt payment of the amount of cash to be paid
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, Parent shall promptly replace or restore, or
cause to be replaced or restored, the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ shall not be used for any
purpose other than as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each former holder of
record of Company Shares represented by a certificate or certificates
immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any (" _Certificates_ "), and
each former holder of record of Company Shares held in book-entry form ("
_Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") (other than holders of Cancelled Company
Shares) (A) transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in
customary form as agreed by the Parties, specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, with respect to Book-
Entry Company Shares, only upon delivery of an "agents message" regarding the
book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Company Shares (or such other evidence, if
any, of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request),
such transmittal materials to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares,
as applicable, in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, each holder of record of one or more Company Shares
represented by Certificates, if any, shall be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ __ (A) the number of

 



-6- 

    

 Company Shares represented by such Certificates by (B) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates.

(iii) _Book-Entry Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Company Shares will not
be required to deliver a Certificate to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Company Shares (other than Cancelled Company Shares) shall upon receipt
by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (it being
understood that the holders of Book-Entry Company Shares shall be deemed to
have surrendered such Company Shares upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of
such "agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent
may reasonably request) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by _multiplying_ __ (A) the number of Book-Entry Company Shares by
(B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Company Shares so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Company
Shares.

 

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificates
or Book-Entry Company Shares, as applicable, is registered, a number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares, as applicable, may be issued to
such transferee or other Person if the Certificates or Book-Entry Company
Shares, as applicable, formerly representing such Company Shares is properly
presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer
or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(v) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Company Share (other than in respect of any
Cancelled Company Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender (together, if
applicable, with a letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions (as applicable)) the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Shares
for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the former holders of Company Shares for 12 months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder of
Company Shares represented by Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares (other
than Cancelled Company Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
for delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_) upon
delivery of evidence of Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares acceptable
to the Surviving Corporation, without any interest thereon in accordance with
the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_, and the Surviving
Corporation shall remain liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) payment of such holders claim for the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of its Certificates or
Book-Entry Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders immediately prior to such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims of interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-7- 

    

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Company Share is presented,
and acceptable, to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Article
II_ , it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger
Consideration (without interest). The Per Share Merger Consideration delivered
upon surrender of Certificates or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents
message", if applicable, in the case of Book-Entry Company Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ , shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares, as
applicable.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their Affiliates shall be entitled to (i) deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law, and (ii) be provided any necessary Tax forms, including IRS
Form W-9 or appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar
information necessary to determine whether any amounts are required to be
deducted or withheld, from any person to whom such payment is required to be
made. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted
or withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the applicable withholding agent
to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

SECTION 2.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
the event that the number of Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock
or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Company
Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time shall have been changed into a
different number of Company Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock or
securities or a different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), combination, stock dividend or
distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, then the Per Share Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of
Company Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company PSUs the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall be construed to
permit the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take
any action that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 2.5 _Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former holder of
Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such
fractional share an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of the fractional share
interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder otherwise
would have been entitled but for this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_) _multiplied by_
(ii) an amount equal to the Closing VWAP.

SECTION 2.6 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to
the Merger, the officers and managers of Parent shall be fully authorized (in
the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise)
to take such action.

that such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in or lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, (II) shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Delaware law, and (III) has received from the Third Party so requesting
such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
 that Parent shall provide to the Company any information or data that is
provided to any Third Party given such access that was not previously made
available to the Company prior to or substantially concurrently with the time
it is provided to such Third Party (and in any event within twenty-four
hours);

(iv) prior to obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote, making a Parent Change of

meanings assigned below:

 

(i) " _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person (other than the Company) or "group" (as defined pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) relating to any direct or indirect sale,
acquisition or purchase, in each case whether by merger, consolidation,
contribution, license, joint venture, sale-leaseback, exchange or otherwise,
involving 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, consolidated net income
(or loss) or consolidated assets of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, 20% or more of the total voting power or equity securities of Parent,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the total voting power or equity
securities of Parent, or any merger, reorganization, 

 



-46- 

    

 consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent which would result in any Person or "group" (as defined
pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), or the equityholders of any
such Person or "group" (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act), beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the
voting power or equity securities of Parent or the surviving entity in a
merger involving Parent or the resulting direct or indirect parent of Parent
or such surviving entity.

 

(ii) " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide and written Parent
Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ for this purpose, all references to "20%"
in the definition of "Parent Acquisition Proposal" will be deemed to be

results in a Third Party or its Representatives making a Parent Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_

Board of Directors of Parent in good faith determines, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor(s), is more favorable, from
a financial point of view, to the stockholders of Parent (in their capacity
as such) than the Merger after taking into account the legal, financial
(including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory, timing or
other aspects of such proposal deemed relevant in good faith by the Board of
Directors of Parent, the identity of the Person or "group" (as defined
pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) making the proposal and any
changes to the terms of this Agreement offered in writing by the Company in
response to such Parent Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with,
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_.

 

SECTION 6.3 _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as

relating to the meeting of Parents stockholders to be held for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote and the meeting of the Companys
stockholders to be held for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote, in each case, in connection with this Agreement and the Merger
(including any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy
Statement_ ") and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _Registration Statement_ "), in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common
Stock to be issued under this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the other Party in connection
with such actions and the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Joint Proxy Statement. Promptly (but in any event no more than five Business
Days) after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act, Parent and the Company will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to
be mailed to their respective stockholders.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall provide the other parties with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform such other parties of any oral
comments, that Parent receives from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Registration Statement promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall
give the other parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed written or oral responses to such comments prior to responding to
the SEC or its staff or and any amendment to the Registration Statement in
response thereto prior to filing such amendment. If Parent or the Company

Registration Statement is required to be amended in order to comply with
applicable Law, then (i) such Party shall promptly inform the other Parties
and (ii) Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
cooperate and mutually agree upon (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) an

 



-47- 

    

 amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement. Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement
as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with, and declared effective by,
the SEC.

SECTION 6.4 _Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) The Company, acting through its Board of Directors (or a committee
thereof), shall as promptly as practicable following the date that the
Registration Statement becomes effective take all action required under the
DGCL, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the
applicable requirements of the New York Stock Exchange necessary to promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite
Vote in connection with this Agreement (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "); _provided_
that the Company may not postpone or adjourn such meeting except (i) the
Company may postpone or adjourn such meeting if, after consultation with
Parent, the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith determines, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to adjourn or
postpone the meeting would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (and, in such case, only postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting to the extent reasonably necessary to mitigate such
potential inconsistency) and (ii) the Company may (or, if Parent so requests,
the Company shall) postpone or adjourn such meeting for up to 30
calendar days if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) there are
(A) insufficient Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and
voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) insufficient Company Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) and voting to obtain the Company Requisite
Vote, whether or not a quorum is present. Subject to any postponement or
adjournment in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Stockholders Meeting to occur
as soon as reasonably practicable (after taking into account any requirements
of applicable Law) and on the same date as the Parent Stockholders Meeting. In
the event that the Company postpones or adjourns the Company Stockholders
Meeting, Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting
such that the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting are scheduled on the same date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be convened and this
Agreement shall be submitted to the Companys stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to affect
such obligation. The Company agrees (i) to provide Parent and its
Representatives with reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy
solicitation results and (ii) upon Parents request, to give written notice
(which may be given via e-mail) to Parent one day prior to, and on the date
of, the Company Stockholders Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date,
sufficient proxies representing the Company Requisite Vote have been obtained.

 

(b) The Company and its Board of Directors shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from the Companys stockholders the Company Requisite Vote,
including by communicating to its stockholders the Company Recommendation (and

Company nor the Board of Directors of Company may (A) withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Recommendation,
(B) fail to make the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, (C)
adopt, approve, recommend or endorse a Company Acquisition Proposal
or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (D) fail to publicly and without qualification
(I) recommend against any Company Acquisition Proposal or (II) reaffirm the
Company Recommendation, in each case within ten Business Days (or such fewer
number of days as remains prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting) after a
Company Acquisition Proposal is made public if requested by Parent to do so,
or (E) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the foregoing, a "
_Company Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that the Company or the
Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Change of Recommendation
and, following such Company Change of Recommendation, may fail to use such
reasonable best efforts, in each case, only if: in response to a Company
Superior Proposal or Company Intervening Event (x) the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have determined in good faith, after

 



-48- 

    

 consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure of
the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware
law, (y) (1) upon such determination the Company shall have delivered to
Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") advising Parent that the
Companys Board of Directors proposes to take such action and, with respect
to a Company Superior Proposal, describing the material terms and conditions
of, and attaching a complete copy of, the Company Superior Proposal that is
the basis of such action (including unredacted copies of the current drafts
of all agreements, commitment letters and other documentation (and schedules
and exhibits thereto) that relate to such Company Superior Proposal), or a
detailed description of the facts and circumstances with respect to the
Company Intervening Event and the reasons for the Companys determination in
subclause (x) above, as applicable, (2) if requested by Parent, the Company
shall have, and shall have caused its subsidiaries to, and shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to, during the
period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 11:59 p.m. New York
City time on the third Business Day immediately following the day on which the
Company delivered the Company Notice (the " _Company Notice Period_ "),
engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Intervening Event would cease to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal or Company Intervening Event and (3)
following the expiration of the Company Notice Period, the Board of Directors
of the Company shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisor(s)) that such Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal or that there
continues to be a Company Intervening Event and in such case, as applicable,
the failure of the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Company
Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware law and (z) the Company shall have complied with its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_. The Parties agree that any material
revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms and conditions of such
Company Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a new Company Superior
Proposal and shall require a new Company Notice and a new Company Notice
Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be required to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if
this Agreement is validly terminated.

(c) Parent, acting through its Board of Directors (or a committee thereof),
shall as promptly as practicable following the date that the Registration
Statement becomes effective take all action required under the DGCL, the
Parent Certificate of Incorporation, the Parent Bylaws and the applicable
requirements of NASDAQ necessary to promptly and duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold as promptly as practicable a meeting of its stockholders for
the purpose of obtaining the Parent Requisite Vote in connection with this
Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Parent Stockholders Meeting_ "); _provided_ that Parent may not postpone or
adjourn such meeting except (i) Parent may postpone or adjourn such meeting
if, after consultation with the Company, the Board of Directors of Parent in
good faith determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to adjourn or postpone the meeting would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (and, in such case, only postpone or
adjourn the Parent Stockholders Meeting to the extent reasonably necessary to
mitigate such potential inconsistency) and (ii) Parent may (or, if the Company
so requests, Parent shall) postpone or adjourn such meeting for up to 30
calendar days if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) there are (A)
insufficient Parent Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) and
voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting or (B) insufficient Parent Shares represented (either in
person or by proxy) and voting to obtain the Parent Requisite Vote, whether or
not a quorum is present. Subject to any postponement or adjournment in
accordance with the foregoing sentence, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Parent Stockholders Meeting to occur as soon as
reasonably practicable (after taking into account any requirements of
applicable Law) and on the same date as the Company Stockholders Meeting. In
the event that Parent postpones or adjourns the Parent Stockholders Meeting,
the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting such that
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting are
scheduled on the same date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the
Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be
submitted to Parents stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to affect such obligation. Parent

periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis and
(ii) upon the Companys request, to give written notice (which may be given

Stockholders Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date, sufficient
proxies representing the Parent Requisite Vote have been obtained.

(d) Parent and its Board of Directors shall each use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain from Parents stockholders the Parent Requisite Vote,
including by communicating to its stockholders the Parent Recommendation (and
including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement), and neither
Parent nor the Board of Directors of Parent may (A) withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to the Company the Parent
Recommendation, (B) fail to make the Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement, (C) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse a Parent Acquisition
Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or
endorse a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (D) fail to publicly and without
qualification (I) recommend against any Parent Acquisition Proposal or (II)
reaffirm the Parent Recommendation, in each case within ten Business Days (or
such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting)
after a Parent Acquisition Proposal is made public if requested by
the Company to do so, or (E) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any
of the foregoing, a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided_ that
Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent may make a Parent Change
of Recommendation and, following such Parent Change of Recommendation, may
fail to use such reasonable best efforts, in each case, only if: in response
to a Parent Superior Proposal or Parent Intervening Event (x) the Board of
Directors of Parent shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel to Parent, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of Parent to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, (y) (1) upon such
determination Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written notice (a "
_Parent Notice_ ") advising the Company that Parents Board of Directors
proposes to take such action and, with respect to a Parent Superior Proposal,
describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy
of, the Parent Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action (including
unredacted copies of the current drafts of all agreements, commitment letters
and other documentation (and schedules and exhibits thereto) that relate to
such Parent Superior Proposal), or a detailed description of the facts and
circumstances with respect to the Parent Intervening Event and the reasons
for Parents determination in subclause (x) above, as applicable, (2) if
requested by the Company, Parent shall have, and shall have caused its
subsidiaries to, and shall have used its reasonable best efforts to cause its
and their Representatives to, during the period from the time the Parent
Notice is provided until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the third Business
Day immediately following the day on which Parent delivered the Parent Notice

Company and its Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Parent Acquisition Proposal or
Parent Intervening Event would cease to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal
or Parent Intervening Event and (3) following the expiration of the Parent
Notice Period, the Board of Directors of Parent shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor(s))
that such Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Parent
Superior Proposal or that there continues to be a Parent Intervening Event and
in such case, as applicable, the failure of the Board of Directors of Parent
to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law and (z) Parent shall have complied with
its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_. The Parties agree that
any material revision, amendment, update or supplement to the terms and
conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal shall be deemed to constitute a
new Parent Superior Proposal and shall require a new Parent Notice and a
new Parent Notice Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to hold the Parent
Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated.

 

SECTION 6.5 _Further Action; Efforts_. __

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
reasonable best efforts to (and, in the case of Parent, cause each of its
subsidiaries and Affiliates (collectively, the " _Parent Group_ ") to) take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

 



-50- 

    

 Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party
hereto agrees to (i) make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within 10 Business Days of
the date hereof, unless the Parties agree otherwise and (ii) supply as
promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take any and all
other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable. Each Party shall cause the filings made by it under the HSR Act
to be considered for grant of "early termination" of the waiting period.

 

(b) Each of Parent Group and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section_
__ _ 6.5(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations or
expiration of waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; (ii) subject to applicable Law, furnish to the other Party as
promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for any
application or other filing to be made by the other Party pursuant to any
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (iii) promptly notify the other Party of any substantive
communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S. or foreign
Governmental Entity and of any substantive communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private Party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and, subject to applicable Law,
furnish the other Party promptly with copies of all correspondence, filings
and communications between them and the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv)
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries received from,
and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information or
documentation that may be requested by the FTC, the DOJ, or by any other
Governmental Entity in respect of such registrations, declarations and filings
or such transactions; and (v) permit the other Party to review any substantive
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance, and
consider in good faith the other Partys reasonable comments in connection
with, any filing, notice, application, submission, communication, meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person;
_provided_ , however, that to the extent any of the documents or information
provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ are commercially or
competitively sensitive, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, may
satisfy its obligations by providing such documents or information to the
other Partys outside counsel, with the understanding and agreement that such
counsel shall not share such documents and information with its client;
_provided_ , _further_ , that materials may also be redacted (x) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (y) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address reasonable
attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns, to the extent
that that such attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns
are not governed by a common interest privilege or doctrine. Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside legal
counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside legal
counsel to any other Representatives of the recipient without the advance
written consent of the Party providing materials designated as such. No Party
shall independently participate in any substantive meeting or communication
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or
other inquiry in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without giving the other Parties sufficient
prior notice of the meeting or communication and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate in
such substantive meeting or communication.

(c) Parent shall (i) at the written direction of the Company, after
consultation with Parent and to the extent determined by the Company in good
faith to be appropriate in the context of Parent seeking to obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
as expeditiously as possible, "pull and refile," pursuant to 16 C.F.R.
803.12, the filing made under the HSR Act on one (but not more than one)
occasion and (ii) be permitted, after consultation with the Company, to the
extent determined by Parent in good faith to be

 



-51- 

    

 appropriate in the context of seeking to obtain the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act as expeditiously as
possible, to "pull and refile" the filing made under the HSR Act on one (but
not more than one) occasion. Parent shall not "pull and refile" such filing on
more than one occasion without the Companys prior written consent. In the
event Parent "pulls and refiles", pursuant to 16 C.F.R. 803.12, the filing
made under the HSR Act, the "refiling" pursuant to any such "pull and refile"
must be submitted no later than 48 hours after the filing is withdrawn, unless
otherwise agreed by the Company in writing.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, no Party shall
commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into a timing agreement,
including any agreement to delay the consummation or not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, with any Governmental Entity without the
prior written consent of the other Party, the provision of which consent shall
be determined by such other Party in good faith and provided in a timely
manner if determined by such Party to be appropriate in the context of
seeking to obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the
HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal,
state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries to, take any and all steps necessary to (x)
resolve, avoid, or eliminate impediments or objections, if any, that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Antitrust Law or (y) avoid the entry of, effect the dissolution of,
and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, order or
judgment that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of
the contemplated transactions, so as to enable the Parties to close the
contemplated transactions expeditiously (but in no event later than the End
Date). In furtherance, but without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Subsidiaries to, (i) propose, negotiate, commit
to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or otherwise, the
sale, divesture, disposition, or license of any assets, properties, products,
rights, services or businesses of Parent, Parents subsidiaries, Parents
Affiliates, or the Company, its subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures or
any interest therein, or agree to any other structural or conduct remedy, and
(ii) otherwise take or commit to take any actions that would limit Parents,
Parents subsidiaries, the Parent Joint Ventures or the Companys, its
subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures freedom of action with respect
to, or its or their ability to retain any assets, properties, products,
rights, services or businesses of Parent, Parents subsidiaries or the Parent
Joint Ventures, or the Company, its subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures
or any interest or interests therein (any such action, a " _Remedy_ ");
_provided_ , that Parent, its subsidiaries and the Parent Joint Ventures
shall not be permitted to take or commit to take any Remedy with respect to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures the
effectiveness of which is not conditioned on the Closing occurring;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, its subsidiaries and the Parent Joint Ventures shall not
be required to take or commit to take any Remedy that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the financial condition of Parent, the Company, their respective subsidiaries,
the Company Joint Ventures and the Parent Joint Ventures, taken as a whole,
after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_, a
material adverse effect shall be measured relative to the size of the Company,
its subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures, taken as a whole, regardless
of whether such actions are imposed on, or affect Parent, the Company, any of
their respective Subsidiaries, the Company Joint Ventures or the Parent Joint
Ventures.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to agree
to any term or take any action in connection with its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_ that is not conditioned upon consummation of the
Merger. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement (x) shall require or
obligate the Company to agree or otherwise be required to, take any action,
including any action contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_, with respect to
the Company or its Affiliates (including The

 



-52- 

    

 Blackstone Group Inc. and any investment funds or investment vehicles
affiliated with, or managed or advised by, The Blackstone Group Inc., or any
portfolio company (as such term is commonly understood in the private equity
industry) or investment of The Blackstone Group Inc. or of any such investment
fund or investment vehicle) other than the Company, its subsidiaries and the
Company Joint Ventures or (y) shall require or obligate Parent to agree or
otherwise be required to, take any action, including any action contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_, with respect to Parent or its Affiliates
(including Tiger Global Management, LLC and any investment funds
or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or advised by, Tiger
Global Management, LLC, or any portfolio company (as such term is commonly
understood in the private equity industry) or investment of Tiger Global
Management, LLC or of any such investment fund or investment vehicle) other
than with respect to Parent, its subsidiaries and the Parent Joint Ventures.

(g) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall, and Parent shall cause each member of the
Parent Group to, cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(h) Neither Party nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall merge with or
into or consolidate with, or purchase or sell a portion of the assets of or
equity in, or acquire or sell by any other manner, any business or any
corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or agree to do any of the foregoing, if the entering into
of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
transaction, would reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any material delay in
the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consents of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) materially increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity entering an order prohibiting the consummation

notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party from any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may

SECTION 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier valid
termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice from
a Party or its Representatives, the other Party and its subsidiaries shall,

respective officers, directors and employees to, afford such Party and its
Representatives reasonable access, consistent with applicable Law, during
normal business hours to such other Partys and its subsidiaries officers,
employees, assets, reports, correspondence and books and records and to
furnish any other documents and information reasonably requested by such
Party or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries or Parent or its subsidiaries (as applicable) or otherwise result
in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such
officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of their normal
duties and shall not include any environmental sampling or testing. No Party
nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege of such Person, or contravene any applicable Law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts (i) to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or (ii) to
develop an alternative to providing such information so as to address such
matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and use all information furnished
by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality and Non-

(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, notwithstanding
Section 5(b) thereof.

 

SECTION 6.8 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or

deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act at the Effective
Time.

 

SECTION 6.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall
be a joint press release and, except in connection with a Company Acquisition

a Parent Change of Recommendation (in each case, if and to the extent
permitted by this Agreement), thereafter the Company and Parent shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public communications with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity (or by the
fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors as reasonably determined by its
Board of Directors), in each case, as determined in the good faith
judgment of the Party proposing to make such release (in which case, such
Party shall not issue or cause the publication of such press release or other

SECTION 6.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the "
_Benefit Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or its
subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or any
subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), (i) a
salary, wage, and target cash bonus opportunity that, in the aggregate, is no
less favorable than the salary, wage, and target cash bonus opportunity that
was provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) equity or equity-based compensation opportunities that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the equity or equity-based compensation
opportunities that are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
and (iii) employee benefits (other than any corporate sale or similar
transaction-related payment or benefit, defined benefit pension benefits,
retiree health or retiree life insurance benefits, nonqualified deferred
compensation benefits, and equity or equity-based compensation) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than any
corporate sale or transaction-related payment or benefit, defined benefit
pension benefits, retiree health or retiree life insurance benefits,
nonqualified deferred compensation benefits, and equity or equity-based
compensation) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that, the foregoing shall not apply (x) with
respect to Continuing Employees for whom a significant portion of compensation
is based on commissions or (y) to the extent Parent adopts salary reduction
program for all of Parent and Parents affiliates of no more than 30% of base
salary and wages and no more than 30% of target annual bonus that is applied
similarly to all similarly situated employees (including similarly situated
Continuing Employees). For the duration of the Benefit Continuation Period,
Parent or one of its Affiliates shall maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee a severance or termination arrangement no less favorable
than the severance or termination arrangement provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (or, if greater, the
severance benefits set forth in _Schedule 6.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter).

(b) Parent shall honor and assume, or shall cause to be honored and assumed,
the terms of all Company Plans set forth on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, subject to the amendment and termination provisions
thereof. Except as set forth on _Schedule 6.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, Parent shall maintain and continue the Companys cash bonus plans with
the same terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time for the
remainder of the 2020 calendar year, except to the extent amendments or
modifications thereto are required by Law.

(c) To the extent that Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plan in which
Continuing Employees participate immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or any of its subsidiaries (including the Company and any subsidiaries
thereof) shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) waive or cause to be waived
any pre-existing conditions, exclusions, limitations, actively-at-work
requirements, and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of
Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to Continuing Employees and
their eligible dependents, (ii) give each Continuing Employee credit for the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles
and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the
Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) to the extent that
it would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent that such
service was recognized under an analogous Company Plan, give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with
the Company for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit
(but excluding for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension
plan) under each applicable Parent benefit plan as if such service had been
performed with Parent. 

(d) The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that the transactions
contemplated by this agreement constitute a "change of control" for the
purposes of each Company Plan that contains a "change of control" or other
similar provision, including but not limited to the Company Stock Plans, the
Company LTIP Plans, and all employment and severance agreements. 

(e) If requested by Parent no later than five (5) Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall terminate, effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) plans

 



-55- 

    

 maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The
Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company
and its subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Board of Directors of the Company or the board of directors of its
subsidiaries, as applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall
be subject to review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company shall also take such other
actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may
reasonably request.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided
otherwise in a written agreement between Parent, the Surviving Corporation,
the Company or any Affiliate of Parent and the Continuing Employee or any
severance, benefit or other applicable plan, policy or program covering such
Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ shall (i) be deemed or
construed to be an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan, (ii)
prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent from
amending or terminating any Company Plans in accordance with their terms or
(iii) create any third-party rights in any current or former service provider
of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

SECTION 6.11 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation agrees that
it will indemnify and hold harmless, in each case to the extent (subject to
applicable Law) such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement
by the Company pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the
Company Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any subsidiary of
the Company and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the date
hereof and set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, each present and former
director and officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or awards paid in settlement incurred
in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal, arising out of, relating to or in connection with
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time by reason of
fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries or was serving at the request of the Company or such
subsidiary as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Person
(including serving at the request of the Company or any such subsidiary with
respect to any employee benefit plan), whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Effective Time.

 

(b) The provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation
and bylaws with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Indemnified Parties shall be no less favorable to such
Indemnified Parties than such provisions contained in the Company Certificate
of Incorporation and Company Bylaws in effect as of the date hereof,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(including any excess policies thereof) maintained by the Company ( _provided_
, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to the insured
than the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
subsidiaries) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual

 



-56- 

    

 basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current aggregate annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium
Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the
Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in
consultation with Parent, may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-
year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies (including any excess
policies thereof) providing equivalent coverage to that described in the
preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an
amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap; _provided_ ,
in the event that such equivalent coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, then the
Company may purchase such equivalent coverage with the prior written consent
of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity or Person or effect any division or similar transaction, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall survive the Merger and,
following the Effective Time, are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and
representatives.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is not prior
to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

SECTION 6.12 _Takeover Statute_ _s_. None of the Company, Parent or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the Stockholder Support
Agreements), and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the
continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Stockholder Support Agreements) from any applicable
Takeover Statute. If any Takeover Statute is, purports to be or may become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Stockholder Support Agreements), each of the Company
and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_ shall be construed to permit the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub to do any act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as
a waiver of any of a Partys rights under, any other provision of this
Agreement.

SECTION 6.13 _Transaction Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time against the Company or any members of its Board of
Directors or Parent or any members of its Board of Directors (the "
_Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company or Parent (as applicable) shall
promptly notify the other Parties of any such Transaction Litigation and shall
keep the other Parties reasonably informed with respect to the status
thereof. Each Party shall give the other Parties the opportunity to
participate in the defense of any Transaction Litigation, and no Party shall
settle or agree to settle any Transaction Litigation without the other Partys
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

deputization" under applicable securities Laws) who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act
and (b) Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable hereto to cause any acquisition of Parent Securities (including

to be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Parent following the Closing to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 6.17 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, the

opinions of counsel referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)_ (in the case of
Parent and Merger Sub) and  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_ (in the case of the
Company). None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall take any action, or
knowingly fail to take any reasonable action, if such action or failure to act
would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying for the
Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties shall cause all applicable Tax Returns to
be filed on a basis of treating the Merger as qualifying for the Intended Tax
Treatment, unless otherwise required by a final "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313 of the Code. Each of the Parties agrees to use
reasonable best efforts to promptly notify all other Parties of any challenge

adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3.

event that such individual is not employed by the Company or a director of the
Board of Directors of the Company, in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time, then such vacancy shall be filled by an individual serving on
the Board of Directors of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be designated by the Company (whom shall be designated as a Class I
director).

SECTION 6.19 _Third Party Consents_. At Parents written request, the
Company shall, and shall cause each subsidiary to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain certain third party consents, amendments,
releases or waivers (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) under
certain Contracts identified in writing to the Company by Parent; _provided_
, _however_ , each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any
such consent, amendment, release or waiver shall not be a condition to the
Merger; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not, and shall cause
each subsidiary not to, contribute capital, pay any consideration in any form
(including any letter of credit, guaranty or other financial or commercial

any form) or propose or agree to any of the foregoing in order to obtain such
consent, release or waiver, in each case, without the prior written consent of

concession unless either (a) the Company is reimbursed or indemnified by
Parent for such concession or (b) such concession is subject to the occurrence
of the consummation of the Merger). The Company shall keep Parent

with respect to, any developments regarding such matters.

SECTION 6.20  _Director Resignations_. The Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain the resignation of all of the members of the Board of the

directors (or any equivalent) of each subsidiary of the Company), which
resignations shall be effective at, and conditioned upon the occurrence of,
the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.21 _Transition_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, and in all cases subject to applicable Law, upon the reasonable
request of Parent, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to,
during normal business hours, reasonably cooperate with Parent and its

Letter; and (y) financing activities with respect to the Company, its
subsidiaries or the Company Joint Ventures that will occur at or after the

such cooperation that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective any earlier than the Closing (other than, to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, executing or entering into or performing any agreement
with respect to one or more of the transactions set forth on _Schedule 6.22_
of the Company Disclosure Letter prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ ,
that, the terms and timeline of any such transaction must be commercially
reasonable (which determination shall be made by the Company in its sole
discretion until immediately prior to the Effective Time) and (5) no directors
of the Company shall be required to approve, execute, enter into or perform
any agreement or instrument (or otherwise take any other action) with respect

TERMINATION

SECTION 8.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or
after each of the Company Requisite Vote and Parent Requisite Vote has been
obtained (except as otherwise provided below):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

 

(b) by Parent or the Company if any court or other Governmental Entity of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final order, decree or ruling or
taken any other final action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action is or
shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a Party if such order, decree, ruling or other final action was
primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement;

in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) or the failure of such Party (or, in the

the primary cause of the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before
the End Date;

 

(d) by written notice from the Company:

 

(i) if there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days after

Directors of Parent shall have materially breached its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ or _(d)_ ;

covenant or agreement on the part of the Company contained in this Agreement,
such that the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __
_ 7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of (A) 30 days after written
notice thereof is given by Parent to the Company or (B) the End Date;
_provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement

(c) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that each of the Regulatory
Termination Payment, Parent Termination Payment and the Company Termination
Payment, as applicable, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 8.2_, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The
Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall either the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Payment or Parent be required to
pay the Parent Termination Payment or the Regulatory Termination Payment, as
the case may be, on more than one occasion. Despite anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to pay both the
Parent Termination Payment and the Regulatory Termination Payment under any
circumstance. Accordingly, payment of the Parent Termination Payment shall
relieve Parent of any obligation to Regulatory Termination Payment and payment
of the Regulatory Termination Payment shall relieve Parent of any obligation
to pay the Parent Termination Payment.

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company
fails to timely pay an amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(ii)_, or Parent fails to timely pay an amount due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(iii)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(iv)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(v)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on
the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a suit that results
in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(ii)_, or any portion thereof, or a
judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _
8.2(b)(iii)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(iv)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)(v)_, or
any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, or Parent shall pay to
the Company, its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
the fees and expenses of any expert or consultant engaged by the Company) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such
payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate, plus 2%, as published in _The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition_ in effect on the date of such payment. Any amount payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ shall be paid by the applicable Party by
wire transfer of same day funds prior to or on the date such payment is
required to be made under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as set
forth in the proviso set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and Parent is paid the
Company Termination Payment from the Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
8.2_, the Company Termination Payment and, if applicable, the costs and
expenses of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_ shall be
the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company, its subsidiaries, the Company Joint Ventures or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, controlling Persons, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, affiliated (or commonly advised)
funds, representatives, agents or any their respective assignees or
successors or any former, current or future general or limited partner,
stockholder, controlling Person, manager, member, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, affiliated (or commonly advised) fund, representative, agent,
assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (the Company and the foregoing
Persons, collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or any certificate or other
document delivered in connection herewith or otherwise or in respect of any
oral or other representation or warranty made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith and upon payment of such amounts, the Company
shall have no further liability or obligation (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the other Company Related Parties shall have no liability or
obligation) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or

 



-66- 

    

 otherwise or in respect of representations or warranties made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith, whether in equity or at law, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, except that nothing (i) shall relieve the Company of its
obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b_) or (ii) limit the rights and
remedies of Parent against the Company under the Confidentiality Agreement or
the rights of Parent or Merger Sub against the Company in the case of Actual
Fraud or Willful Breach.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as set
forth in the proviso set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and the Company is paid the
Parent Termination Payment or the Regulatory Termination Payment
(as applicable) from Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, the Parent
Termination Payment or the Regulatory Termination Payment (as applicable) and,
if applicable, the costs and expenses of the Company pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 8.2(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Company
against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, controlling
Persons, managers, members, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, representatives, agents or any their
respective assignees or successors or any former, current or future general or

officer, employee, Affiliate, affiliated (or commonly advised) fund,
representative, agent, assignee or successor of any of the foregoing (Parent,
Merger Sub and the foregoing Persons, collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement
or any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or
otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have
been made in connection herewith or therewith and upon payment of such
amounts, Parent and Merger Sub shall have no further liability or obligation
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, the other Parent Related Parties shall have
no liability or obligation) relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in

whether in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise; except that
nothing (i) shall relieve Parent of its obligations under _Section_ __ _
6.7(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.22(c)_ or (ii) limit the rights and remedies of
the Company against Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement or the rights
and remedies of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub in the case of Actual
Fraud or Willful Breach.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and
without limiting the Companys or Parents rights under _Section_ __ _

SECTION 9.8 _Parties in Interest_ _; Measure of Damages_. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and

breach of this Agreement on behalf of their respective equityholders (which
each Party acknowledges and agrees may include damages based on a decrease in

-77- 

    

 with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of

would cause the application of any laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of Delaware).

Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered

counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original

SECTION 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
without any requirement for the posting of any bond or other security, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The Parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the
Closing, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek
specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and
to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement, including  _Section_ __ _
6.5_, by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, and to cause the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to
effect the Closing in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, on the terms and
subject to the conditions in this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either Party
has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

SECTION 9.13 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof and thereof,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and (d) consents to
service being made through the notice procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.4_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be effective
service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of
the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve process
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_, that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment
or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, that the
suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may
not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that
would hinder, fetter or delay the levy,

 



-78- 

    

 execution or collection of any amount to which the Party is entitled
pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each Party
expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be
irrevocable under the Laws of the State of Delaware and of the United States
of America; _provided_ that each such Partys consent to jurisdiction and
service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ is solely for the purpose
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ and shall not be deemed to be a
general submission to said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for
such purpose.

 

SECTION 9.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF OR THEREOF.

SECTION 9.15 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Exhibit or Section, such reference shall be to an Article, Exhibit or
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when
used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this
Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined
therein. Words of any gender include each other gender and neuter genders and
words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular
number, respectively. Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means
such Contract or Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of Contracts) by waiver or consent and (in the case of
Laws) by succession or comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. The word "or"
shall not be exclusive. The word "will" shall be construed to have the same
meaning as the word "shall". Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of
days, such number shall refer to calendar days unless Business Days are
specified. The word "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject
or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if". References to "dollars" or "$" are to United States of America dollars.
Any deadline or time period set forth in this Agreement that by its terms ends
on a day that is not a Business Day shall be automatically extended to
the next succeeding Business Day. Each of the Parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiating of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if it is
drafted by all the Parties and without regard to any presumption or rule
requiring construction or interpretation against the Party drafting or causing
any instrument to be drafted.
