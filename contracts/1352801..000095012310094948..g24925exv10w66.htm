 7. _Indemnification and Contribution_. 

  

 (a) _Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers._ Merger Sub agrees and, upon execution of the Joinder Agreement, the Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agree, to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or 

   ##### 

  

 

alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary
Offering Memorandum, any of the other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer
Written Communication or the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in
each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise
out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any
information relating to any Initial Purchaser furnished to Merger Sub or the
Company in writing by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives
expressly for use therein. 

   

 (b) _Indemnification of Merger Sub, the Company and the Guarantors._ Each Initial Purchaser agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless Merger Sub, its directors and officers and each person who controls Merger Sub within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of Section 20 of the Exchange Act and, upon execution of the Joinder Agreement, the Company, each of the Guarantors, each of their respective directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company or any of the Guarantors within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Initial Purchaser furnished to Merger Sub in writing by such Initial Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, any of the other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Written Communication or the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the third paragraph, the fourth and fifth sentence of the tenth paragraph and the twelfth paragraph, in each case, found under the heading "Plan of distribution." 

  

 (c) _Notice and Procedures._ If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the " _Indemnified Person_ ") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the " _Indemnifying Person_ ") in writing; _provided_ that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any 

   ##### 

  

 

others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the
Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and
expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such
proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the
Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii)
the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified
Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to
the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and
the Indemnified Person and the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably
concluded that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It
is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate
firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that
all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such
separate firm for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and
officers and any control persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be
designated in writing by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and any such separate firm
for Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors, their respective directors and
officers and any control persons of Merger Sub, the Company and the
Guarantors shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying
Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be
a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to
indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement
of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified
Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been
sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x)
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all
liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y)
does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability
or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person. 

   

 (d) _Contribution._ If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by Merger Sub, the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such 

   ##### 

  

 

proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of Merger Sub, the
Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by Merger Sub, the
Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the
other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net
proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by Merger Sub from the sale
of the Securities and the total discounts and commissions received by the
Initial Purchasers in connection therewith, as provided in this Agreement,
bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of
Merger Sub, the Company and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Initial
Purchasers on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by Merger Sub, the Company or any Guarantor or by the
Initial Purchasers and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. For the avoidance of doubt, until the Company, the Guarantors or
their respective directors, officers and control persons are entitled to
indemnification from the Initial Purchasers, they are not entitled
to contribution under this Section 7(d). 

   

 (e) _Limitation on Liability._ Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by _pro_ _rata_ allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Initial Purchaser be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total discounts and commissions received by such Initial Purchaser with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. 

  

 (f) _Non-Exclusive Remedies._ The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, by notice to Merger Sub, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by the Company or any of the Guarantors shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery, of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Offering Memorandum. 

  

 9. _Defaulting Initial Purchaser_. (a) If, on the Closing Date, any Initial Purchaser defaults on its obligation to purchase the Securities that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons satisfactory to Merger Sub on the terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Initial Purchaser, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then Merger Sub shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers to purchase such Securities on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Initial Purchaser, either the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers or Merger Sub may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for Merger Sub or counsel for the Initial Purchasers may be necessary in the Time of Sale Information, the Offering Memorandum or in any other document or arrangement, and Merger Sub and the Company agree to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Time of Sale Information or the Offering Memorandum that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term "Initial Purchaser" includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in _Schedule 1_ hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a defaulting Initial Purchaser agreed but failed to purchase. 

  

 (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and Merger Sub as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then Merger Sub shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Initial Purchaser to purchase the principal amount of Securities that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder plus such Initial Purchasers _pro_ _rata_ share (based on the principal amount of Securities that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers for which such arrangements have not been made. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and Merger Sub as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if Merger Sub shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the Guarantors, except that Merger Sub, the Company and each of the Guarantors will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect. 

  

 (d) Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Initial Purchaser of any liability it may have to Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors or any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser for damages caused by its default. 

  

 10. _Payment of Expenses_ _._ (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, Merger Sub agrees and, upon the execution and delivery of the Joinder Agreement, the Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident to the performance of their respective obligations hereunder, including without limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale, preparation and delivery of the Securities and any taxes payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation and printing of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, any other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Written Communication and the Offering Memorandum (including any amendment or supplement thereto) and the distribution thereof; (iii) the costs of reproducing and distributing each of the Transaction Documents and the fees and expenses attributable to creating and perfecting the security interest in the Collateral as contemplated by the Escrow Agreement (including the reasonable related fees and expenses of counsel for the Initial Purchasers for all periods prior to and after the Closing Date); (iv) the fees and expenses of Merger Subs, the Companys and the Guarantors counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate and the preparation, printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees and expenses of counsel for the Initial Purchasers); (vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, any paying agent and the Escrow Agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel to such parties); (viii) all expenses and fees incurred in connection with the approval of the Securities for book-entry transfer by DTC; and (ix) all expenses incurred by Merger Sub and the Company in connection with any "road show" presentation to potential investors. 

  

 (b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8, (ii) Merger Sub for any reason fails to tender the Securities for delivery to the Initial Purchasers or (iii) the Initial Purchasers decline to purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement, Merger Sub agrees, and, upon execution and delivery of the Joinder
Agreement, the Company and each of the Guarantors jointly and severally agree
to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the
Initial Purchasers in connection with this Agreement and the
offering contemplated hereby. 

   

 11. _Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and any controlling persons referred to herein, and the affiliates, officers and directors of each Initial Purchaser referred to in Section 7 hereof. Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein. No purchaser of Securities from any Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to be a successor merely by reason of such purchase. 

  

 12. _Survival_. The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, representations, warranties and agreements of Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of Merger Sub, the Company, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers.

For purposes of this Agreement, (a) except where otherwise expressly provided, the term "affiliate" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (b) the term "business day" means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to be closed in New York City; (c) the term "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (d) the term "written communication" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (e) the term "significant subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act.
