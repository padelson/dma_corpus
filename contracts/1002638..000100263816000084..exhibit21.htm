to the Purchaser at the Initial Closing) such costs, liabilities and burdens
with respect to the Remaining Assets, are held and borne by the Purchaser

and (ii) except as set forth in Schedule 3.13(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, no such plan is subject to the minimum funding standards of Section
412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA.

(d)Other than as required under COBRA or as set forth in Schedule 3.13(d) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no Seller Benefit Plan provides post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits to any individual for any reason, and
no member of the Seller Group or the Acquired Company or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has any Liability to provide post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits to any individual or ever represented, promised, or
contracted to any individual that such individual would be provided with post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits.

(e)Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in
Schedule 3.13(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions will not (either alone or in combination with
another event, including a subsequent termination of employment or service)
(i) result in any payment from any member of the Seller Group or the Acquired
Company becoming due, or increase the amount of any compensation due, to any
Transferred Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Seller Benefit Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting or funding of any compensation or benefits from any member of the
Seller Group or the Acquired Company to any Transferred Employee or (iv)
result in any payment that would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, except as set forth in Schedule 3.13(e) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, no amount payable to any Transferred Employee (whether in
cash or property or as a result of accelerated vesting) as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions (either alone or together with any other event) under any Seller
Benefit Plan or other compensation arrangement would be nondeductible under
Section 280G of the Code. Neither any member of the Seller Group nor the
Acquired Company has any obligation to compensate or otherwise "gross up" any
Transferred Employee for any Taxes incurred by such Transferred Employee as a
result of Sections 409A or 4999 of the Code.

Proceeding relating to a Seller Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), and no Seller Benefit Plan has within the last year prior to the

ARTICLE 4

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

Except as specifically set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in,
the disclosure schedules, dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered
by the Purchaser to the Sellers (collectively, the "Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any matter in any section
or subsection in the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have
been disclosed in any other section or subsection in the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule to which the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent
on the face of such disclosure), the Purchaser represents and warrants to the
Sellers as follows as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date:

4.1Corporate Organization. The Purchaser is, and each member of the Purchaser
Group will be at each applicable Closing, a Business Entity duly incorporated
or organized, validly existing, and, to the extent applicable in its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has full corporate
power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted. Each member of
the Purchaser Group is, or as of the applicable Closing will be, duly
qualified as necessary to conduct the Business following the applicable
Closing Date and, to the extent legally applicable, is, or as of the
applicable Closing will be, in good standing under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which the Business is conducted, except where the failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. The Purchaser is a resident of Canada for
purposes of the US Treaty and the Irish Treaty, and is entitled to all of the
benefits of the US Treaty and of the Irish Treaty, as in force as of the date
hereof and the Initial Closing Date.



4.2Authorization. The Purchaser has, and each other member of the Purchaser
Group will have at the applicable Closing, all necessary corporate power and
authority it requires to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party, consummate the Contemplated Transactions and perform its
respective obligations under the Transaction Agreements to which it is a
party. Each member of the Purchaser Group has obtained, or will have obtained
prior to the applicable Closing Date, all corporate approvals necessary for
the due and valid authorization of its execution, delivery and performance of
the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation by it
of the Contemplated Transactions, as applicable. The Purchaser has duly and
validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, on or prior to the
applicable

 Closing, each member of the Purchaser Group will have duly and validly
executed and delivered the other Transaction Agreements to which it is a
party. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of the
Transaction Agreements by the other parties thereto, this Agreement is, and at
each applicable Closing each other Transaction Agreement will be, a valid and
binding obligation of each member of the Purchaser Group that is a party
hereto or thereto, as applicable, enforceable against such member of the
Purchaser Group in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability,
to (a) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, preferential transfers or the relief of debtors, and
(b) rules of Law governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other
equitable remedies or general principles of equity.



4.3No Conflict. Except for the requirements of the HSR Act and any Antitrust
Laws of jurisdictions outside the United States of America (if and to the
extent any of the foregoing Laws may apply), the execution, delivery and
performance by each member of the Purchaser Group of the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party and/or the consummation by each such member
of the Purchaser Group of the Contemplated Transactions, as applicable, do not
and will not, as applicable, (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the
Purchaser's certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or the equivalent
organizational documents of the applicable member of the Purchaser Group),
each as amended to date; (b) conflict with or violate any Law or Order
applicable to any member of the Purchaser Group, or require any member of the
Purchaser Group to obtain any Governmental Authorization or make any filing
with or provide notification to any Governmental Entity; or (c) conflict with,
result in any breach of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or
lapse of time or both), give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration under any material agreement or instrument to which any member of
the Purchaser Group or one of their respective Affiliates is a party; except
in the cases of clauses (b) and (c), where the conflict, violation, breach,
default, termination, cancellation or acceleration would not have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.



4.4Legal Proceedings. There is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened by or against any member of the
Purchaser Group that questions or challenges the validity of this Agreement or
the ability of the Purchaser Group to consummate any of the Contemplated
Transactions.



4.5Available Financing.

(a)The Purchaser has delivered to the Sellers a correct and complete copy of
the executed Debt Commitment Letter (including the related executed Fee
Letter) (with only certain fee amounts, pricing caps, "market flex" and other
economic terms redacted (none of which terms adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability or availability of the Financing or reduces the
aggregate principal amount thereof)). The Debt Commitment Letter and the
commitments thereunder are in full force and effect on the date hereof, have
not been amended or modified or withdrawn, waived or rescinded except as
permitted hereby and, as of the date hereof, (i) there is no breach or default
by the Purchaser or, to the Purchaser's Knowledge, any of the Financing
Sources existing (or which with notice or lapse of time or both may exist)
thereunder; provided that the Purchaser is not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty set forth in Article 3 or non-compliance or non-performance by the
Sellers (and their respective Affiliates) with their respective obligations
hereunder and (ii) assuming performance by the Sellers of their obligations
hereunder that are required to be performed prior to the Initial

 Closing and the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 3 (in each case, only to the extent necessary to satisfy the
conditions in Sections 6.3(a)(i) and (ii)), the Purchaser does not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be
satisfied or that the amount of the Financing necessary for the satisfaction
of each of the items described in the final sentence of this paragraph (a)
will not be available to the Purchaser on the Initial Closing Date. The
Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter
that are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof, and as of the date
hereof the Debt Commitment Letter constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, the other
parties thereto, in each case except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other Laws
affecting creditors' rights generally. Upon the funding of the Financing in
accordance with and subject to its terms and conditions and assuming
performance by the Sellers of their obligations that are required to be
performed prior to the Initial Closing and the accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article 3 (in each case, only to the extent
necessary to satisfy the conditions in Sections 6.3(a)(i) and (ii)), the
aggregate proceeds of the Financing plus unrestricted available cash on hand
of the Purchaser as of the Initial Closing Date will be sufficient to satisfy
the obligation to pay (A) the Purchase Price, (B) all fees and expenses
incurred by the Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
that are due and payable and required to be paid on the Initial Closing Date
and (C) all other amounts required to be paid by the Purchaser Group on the
Initial Closing Date to consummate the Initial Closing (including the
transactions contemplated or required by the Debt Commitment Letter) (the sum
of clauses (A), (B) and (C) above, the "Required Closing Amount").

(b)Except as otherwise specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
(i) there are no conditions precedent, "market flex" provisions or other
contingencies to the obligations of the parties thereto to fund the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; and (ii) as of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other contracts or agreements that could impact
the availability of the Financing or the commitment by the lenders under the
Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Financing, or the conditions, the
"certain funds" provisions or the termination provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter.



4.6Solvency. The Purchaser is not entering into the Contemplated Transactions
with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of the Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries. Assuming the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3 to the Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, the Purchaser and its
subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will be Solvent on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to the Contemplated Transactions, including the Financing
and payment of all related fees and expenses. As used in this Section 4.6, the
term "Solvent" means, with respect to any Person as of a particular date, that
on such date, (a) the fair value of the assets (on a going concern basis) of
such Person, on a consolidated basis, exceeds, on a consolidated basis, its
debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present
fair saleable value of the property (on a going concern basis) of such Person,
on a consolidated basis, is greater than the amount that will be required to
pay the probable liability, on a consolidated basis, of its debts and other
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other
liabilities become absolute and matured in the ordinary course of business;
(c) such Person, on a consolidated basis, is able to pay its debts and
liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such liabilities become
absolute and matured in the ordinary course of business; and (d) such Person,
on a consolidated basis, is not engaged in, and is not about to engage in,
business contemplated as of the date hereof for which it has unreasonably
small capital.



 4.7Brokers' Fees. No member of the Purchaser Group has any Liability to pay
any fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions except fees which will be borne entirely by the
Purchaser.



4.8Disclaimer of Reliance on Other Representations and Warranties. The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the Seller Representations
and the representations and warranties set forth in any other Transaction
Agreement (or any certificate delivered by any member of the Seller Group or
any of their respective Representatives pursuant hereto or thereto) therewith,
none of the Sellers nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, makes, or has made, any
representation or warranty relating to itself or the Business or otherwise in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and the Purchaser is not
relying on any representation or warranty except for those expressly set forth
in this Agreement. The Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted, to its
satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the condition, operations
and business of the Business and the Acquired Assets, in making its
determination to proceed with the Contemplated Transactions, the Purchaser has
relied on the results of its own independent investigation.

5.2Access to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the final
Closing (such Closing, the "Final Closing" and the date of the Final Closing,
the "Final Closing Date"), subject to the requirements and limitations of
applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws) and Orders, the Sellers will (and
will cause their Affiliates to) allow the Purchaser and its Representatives,
and, subject to Section 5.8, its Financing Sources and their Representatives,
in accordance with the procedures to be agreed upon by the parties, access
through and under the supervision of an Authorized Seller Representative and
upon reasonable notice and during normal working hours to (a) such materials
and information about the Business as the Purchaser may reasonably request
(provided that the Sellers shall not have any obligations to provide interim
financial statements beyond those provided for in Section 5.12) including
information with respect to provision of services and billing of Customers,
(b) the properties, assets, Contracts, invoices, books and records and other
documents, data and information relating to the Business to the extent that
any of the foregoing relates to an Acquired Asset or an Assumed Liability
(including using best efforts to provide such access to Assumed Contracts with
Customers as the Purchaser or its Representatives may reasonably require in
connection with any audit of deferred revenue) and (c) specified members of
management, senior employees and key functional leads of the Business as the
Purchaser may reasonably request (including in connection with its integration
planning processes) and to which EMC consents (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it will not, and will cause its
Affiliates to not, prior to the Initial Closing, with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, contact or otherwise communicate with, either
orally or in writing, any distributor, partner, customer or supplier of the
Business without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and may be provided by
electronic mail confirmation by an Authorized Seller Representative. To the
extent discussions with respect to the Contemplated Transactions with
distributors, partners, customers or suppliers of the Business take place
prior to the Initial Closing Date, the Sellers shall be entitled to have a
representative present in all such discussions. The Purchaser agrees that any
investigation undertaken pursuant to the access granted under this Section 5.2
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
operation of the Business or the other businesses of the Sellers and their
respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize attorney-client privilege or contravene any applicable Laws
or Orders; provided that if reasonably practicable, the Sellers will, and will
cause their Affiliates to, use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the
Purchaser in making alternative arrangements if access and disclosure is
declined pursuant to the foregoing. No information or knowledge obtained by
the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall (i) affect or be deemed to
affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto to consummate
the Closing in Article 6 or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies of the Purchaser hereunder or (ii) be deemed to affect or modify the
Purchaser's reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by the Sellers in this Agreement.



5.3Intercompany Arrangements. Except as may be mutually agreed by the parties,
(i) any intercompany contracts (other than the EIC Business IP License),
arrangements, financing agreements, intercompany loans, transactions,
accounts, commitments and claims between the Acquired Company, on

 the one hand, and any member of the Seller Group or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand and (ii) any Assumed Contracts or Acquired
Company Contracts to which, after the legal assignment (or, in the case of any
Assumed Contract that constitutes a Shared Contract, split and partial legal
assignment or novation) thereof to the Purchaser or its designee in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions, any member of the Seller Group or any of
their respective Affiliates would remain a party, shall be terminated (or
deemed terminated without any action on the part of any party), effective no
later than as of the Initial Closing, other than Transaction Agreements.



5.4Resignations. On or prior to the Initial Closing Date, the Sellers will
deliver to the Purchaser the duly signed resignation letters, effective at the
time of the Initial Closing, of all officers and directors of the Acquired
Company as requested by the Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Initial Closing Date.



5.5Confidentiality.

(a)Prior to the Initial Closing, each party agrees not to issue any press
release or make any other public announcement relating to this Agreement or
the other Transaction Agreements without the prior written approval of the
other party, except that each party reserves the right, without the other
party's prior consent, to make any public disclosure it believes in good faith
is required by applicable securities Laws or stock exchange rules or
securities listing standards, including the filing of this Agreement with the
SEC and any applicable Canadian provincial or territorial securities authority
(in which case the disclosing party agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to advise
the other party prior to making such disclosure). The parties agree that (i)
the initial press release to be issued with respect to the Contemplated
Transactions and (ii) the initial communication(s) to the Customers to be sent
after the date hereof, in each case, shall be in a form mutually agreed to by
the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) to the extent the content of
any press release or other public statement has been made in accordance with
this Section 5.5, no separate approval shall be required in respect of such
content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent press
release or other public statement, and (y) the parties may make public
statements in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analysts conference calls, so long
as any such statements are consistent with the initial press release and other
press releases and public statements made jointly by the parties or made by
one party in accordance with this Section 5.5 and do not reveal (1) in the
case of any such statement by any Seller, any Business Confidential
Information, (2) in the case of any such statement by the Purchaser, any
Seller Confidential Information or (3) in either case, any material nonpublic
information regarding this Agreement, any other Transaction Agreements, or the
Contemplated Transactions.

(b)Each party agrees to continue to abide by that certain Non-Disclosure
Agreement dated as of October 23, 2015, by and between EMC and the Purchaser
(the "NDA"), the terms of which are incorporated by reference in this
Agreement and which terms will survive until the Initial Closing, at which
time the NDA will terminate with respect to any Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability; provided, however, that if this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Initial Closing, the NDA will continue in full force
and effect. Except as contemplated by subsection (a) hereof, the existence of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and the terms hereof and
thereof (including the exhibits and schedules appended hereto and thereto)
will be deemed "Confidential Information" for purposes of the NDA.





5.6Regulatory Filings; Consents.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties agree to
use Reasonable Efforts to (i) make all necessary and appropriate filings with
all applicable Governmental Entities and obtain required approvals and
clearances with respect thereto, and (ii) obtain all material consents,
waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders of any Person required in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

(b)Without limiting the generality of Section 5.6(a), each of the Sellers and
the Purchaser agrees to (i) as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, but in no event later than the earlier of (A) the date legally
required for filing and (B) the twentieth (20th) Business Day following the
date of execution and delivery of this Agreement (except as otherwise agreed
by the parties), (1) file any notification and report forms and related
material that it may be required to file with the United States Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice under the HSR Act and (2) prepare and submit a joint voluntary notice
with respect to the Contemplated Transactions to CFIUS pursuant to Exon-
Florio, and (ii) make, using Reasonable Efforts, any further filings or
information submissions that may be requested, necessary, proper or advisable
pursuant to the HSR Act or Exon-Florio. In addition, each party agrees to file
with the applicable Governmental Entity, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, any filings or similar information
submissions required under any other applicable Laws, Orders, or
administrative or judicial doctrines that are designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade, significantly impeding effective competition,
substantially lessening competition, or constituting anticompetitive conduct
(collectively, together with the HSR Act, the "Antitrust Laws"). Each party
will promptly notify the other party of any material communication it or any
of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Entity relating to the
Contemplated Transactions, and will permit the other party to review in
advance, if possible, any proposed material communication by such party to any
Governmental Entity. Neither party will agree to participate in any meeting
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity and is reasonably practicable, gives the
other party and/or its outside counsel the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. The parties will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.
Each party will provide to counsel for the other party correct and complete
copies of all material correspondence, material filings or material
communications (except personal identifier information provided pursuant to
Exon-Florio) between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions; distribution of
these materials may be limited to outside counsel only, upon reasonable
request of the providing party. Subject to the foregoing obligations, the
Purchaser shall have sole control over the strategy to obtain required
approvals and clearances with applicable Governmental Entities. The Purchaser
will, however, solicit and consider in good faith the Sellers' suggestions
regarding such strategy.

(c)Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 5.6 or elsewhere in
this Agreement, the Purchaser shall pay any and all filing fees due under the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions outside of the United
States of America in connection with the filings described above and

 neither the Sellers nor any other member of the Seller Group will have any
Liability with respect to the payment of such filing fees.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, each party will
use its Reasonable Efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity or private plaintiff with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws. In
connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as a
violation of any Antitrust Law, to the extent directed by the Purchaser, each
party will cooperate and use its Reasonable Efforts to contest and resist any
such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned
any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions; provided, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to
litigate with or otherwise participate in any Legal Proceeding with any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining any consent required by this
Agreement or to consummate the Contemplated Transaction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event any Governmental Entity objects to the Contemplated
Transactions and in order to ensure that all Governmental Authorizations are
obtained prior to the Latest Termination Date, the Purchaser shall propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit
to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any of the Acquired Assets, or otherwise offer
to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking
(and if such offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action) that
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the
Business or any of the Acquired Assets, in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Order in any suit or proceeding, which would
have the effect of preventing or delaying the Initial Closing Date beyond the
Latest Termination Date; provided, however, that, with respect to obtaining
approvals and clearances under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall not be required to take such actions that reasonably would be expected
to materially and adversely affect the reasonably anticipated benefits to the
Purchaser of the Contemplated Transactions, with the understanding that any
such actions that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, have the effect of reducing the revenues to be realized by the
Purchaser Group from the Business by more than ten percent (10%) as compared
to the Business' 2015 fiscal year as set forth in the Most Recent Audited
Balance Sheet shall be deemed "material and adverse" for this purpose; and
provided, further, that, with respect to obtaining consents with respect to
CFIUS, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the
Sellers, the Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be
obligated to consent to or take any action, and, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, neither the Sellers nor any of their Affiliates
shall consent to or take any action to sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of any assets, businesses or interest, or agree to conditions relating
to or changes in the conduct of its business or the Business (any such
measure, a "Burdensome Condition"). Each party hereto agrees that it shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any transaction, or any
agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that
would, in and of itself, reasonably be expected to significantly delay (i) the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws applicable to the Contemplated Transactions or (ii) the receipt
of all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of any Governmental
Entity necessary for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, which
delay will cause such expiration, termination or receipt to occur after
January 1, 2017.



 5.7Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent. Without limiting any other provision
of this Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Purchaser and the Sellers shall each use Reasonable
Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Law or Order or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Contemplated
Transactions as soon as practicable after the date hereof; provided that
nothing in this Section 5.7 shall require the Purchaser or the Sellers to
waive any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 or cause the Purchaser to
consent to any action or omission that would be inconsistent with Section 5.1
or Section 5.6.



5.8Financing.

(a) 

(i)The Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and use its reasonable best efforts to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and
obtain the financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt
Commitment Letter (as such terms and conditions may be modified or adjusted in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof and within the limits of any
"market flex" provisions therein) (the "Financing"), and the Purchaser will
not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid in respect of or original
issue discount of the Financing (or payment of fees having similar effect), in
each case, other than any such fees or original discount that is paid or
otherwise funded by sources other than the Financing), unless, after such
reduction, the Contemplated Transactions hereby could still be consummated on
the Initial Closing Date and the aggregate proceeds of the remaining portion
of the Financing and of any Replacement Financing plus unrestricted available
cash on hand of the Purchaser as of the Initial Closing Date would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations to pay the Required Closing Amount or
(B) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand
any conditions (in a manner adverse to the Purchaser or the Sellers), to the
receipt of the Financing, in the case of either clause (A) or (B) above, in a
manner that could reasonably be expected to (1) prevent, impede or delay the
ability of the Purchaser to consummate the Initial Closing, (2) make any
portion of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) less likely to be obtained or prevent, impede or delay in any
material respect the funding of the Financing or (3) adversely impact the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that the Purchaser may, without the
consent of the Sellers, (x) amend the Debt Commitment Letter (I) in accordance
with any "market flex" provisions thereof and (II) to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities (in each case,
excluding any Affiliates of the Purchaser) who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement and (y) otherwise amend or
replace the Debt Commitment Letter so long as in the case of this clause (y),
(I) any such amendment satisfies the requirements of clauses (A) and (B) above
and (II) with respect to replacements, the replacement debt commitments
otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternative Financing set
forth in clause (iii) below (any debt financing

 under any such replacement debt commitment letter satisfying such
requirements, a "Replacement Financing"). The Purchaser shall provide a
correct and complete copy of each replacement debt commitment letter (together
with a correct and complete copy of any related replacement fee letter, which
may be redacted as provided in Section 4.5 with respect to the Fee Letter)
with respect to any Replacement Financing to the Sellers as promptly as
practicable but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Purchaser's
entry into such commitment letter. In the event of such amendment or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted by this clause (i), (1)
the financing under such amended or replaced Debt Commitment Letter will be
deemed to be the "Financing" as such term is used in this Agreement, (2) the
term "Debt Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include any such amended or
replaced debt commitment letter, (3) the term "Fee Letter" will be deemed to
include any amended or replaced fee letter with respect thereto and (4) any
reference to the "Financing Sources" will include the financing institutions
contemplated to provide any such alternative or replacement financing.

(ii)The Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in effect
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any definitive agreements entered into
in connection therewith), (B) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver
of) all conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter applicable to, and within the
control of, the Purchaser necessary to obtaining the Financing on the Initial
Closing Date and comply with (or obtain a waiver of) its obligations
thereunder (but excluding any condition where the failure to be so satisfied
is a direct result of the Sellers' failure to furnish information as required
under Section 5.8(b)), (C) subject to the terms and upon satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (without
limiting clause (B) above), cause the Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter to fully fund the Financing provided for thereunder on or
prior to the Initial Closing Date and (D) fully enforce the Financing Sources'
obligations and its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent
required to consummate the Contemplated Transactions on the Initial Closing
Date. The Purchaser will keep the Sellers reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of the Purchaser's
efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof and
shall provide to the Sellers, upon the Sellers' request and otherwise within
three (3) Business Days of the occurrence thereof, copies of any amendments,
modifications or supplements to the Debt Commitment Letter related to the
availability of the Financing, the commitment by the lenders to provide the
Financing, or the conditions, the "certain funds" provisions, any "market
flex" provisions (redacted in a customary manner) or the termination
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event that the Purchaser
commences an enforcement action to enforce its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements entered into in connection
therewith and/or to compel the Financing Sources under the Debt Commitment
Letter to fund the Financing (any such action, a "Financing Action"), the
Purchaser shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of the Financing Action.

(iii)If any portion of the Financing becomes reasonably likely to be
unavailable or the Purchaser becomes aware of any event or circumstance that
is reasonably likely to result in any portion of the Financing being
unavailable (other than as a result of a breach by the Sellers of this
Agreement that would cause the Financing not to be available in accordance

 with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter), in each case, on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market
flex" provisions) and such portion is required to fund the Required Closing
Amount or any other amounts required to be funded by the Purchaser on the
Initial Closing Date under this Agreement, (i) the Purchaser will promptly
notify the Sellers and (ii) the Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event alternative financing (from the same financing source or a bona fide
third party financing source) (A) in an amount sufficient, when added to any
portion of the Financing that is available and unrestricted available cash on
hand of the Purchaser, to pay in cash the Required Closing Amount and (B) that
does not impose new or additional conditions that were not contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions that were contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into
account any "market flex" provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter) (in a
manner adverse to the Purchaser or the Sellers), in each case, in a manner
materially less favorable or more onerous to the Purchaser or the Sellers,
taken as a whole, or that could reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
delay the ability of the Purchaser to consummate the Initial Closing or
prevent, impede or delay in any material respect the funding of the Financing
(any such alternative financing satisfying such requirements, an "Alternative
Financing"). The Purchaser shall provide a correct and complete copy of each
alternative financing commitment letter (together with a correct and complete
copy of any related fee letter, which may be redacted as provided in Section
4.5 with respect to the Fee Letter) to the Sellers as promptly as practicable
but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the Purchaser's entry into
such commitment letter. In such event (1) the term "Financing" will be deemed
to include any Alternative Financing, (2) the term "Debt Commitment Letter"
will be deemed to include any commitment letters with respect to any such
Alternative Financing, (3) the term "Fee Letter" will be deemed to include any
fee letter with respect to any such Alternative Financing and (4) any
reference to the "Financing Sources" will include the financing institutions
contemplated to provide any such Alternative Financing.

(iv)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall give
the Sellers notice as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event
within three (3) Business Days: (A) of any breach or default by any party to
the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Financing of
which the Purchaser becomes aware; (B) of the receipt by the Purchaser of any
written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with
respect to (1) any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to
the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing
of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document
related to the Financing or (2) any dispute or disagreement between the
Purchaser (and/or its Subsidiaries) on one hand, and the other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document on the other hand, that
pertains to the availability of the Financing or the commitment by the lenders
under the Debt Commitment Letter to provide the Financing, or the conditions,
the "certain funds" provisions, any "market flex" provisions (if relevant to
the availability of the Financing) or the termination provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter; and (C) if for any reason the Purchaser believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt

 Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Financing;
provided, however, that in no event will the Purchaser be under any obligation
to disclose any information shared among the Purchaser and its professional
advisors in connection with matters contemplated by clause (A) or (B) that is
subject to attorney-client or similar legal privilege if the Purchaser shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way
that would not waive such privilege.

(v)Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall
have the right to substitute the net cash proceeds received by the Purchaser
after the date hereof and on or prior to the Initial Closing Date of
consummated equity or equity-linked offerings or debt offerings or other
incurrences of debt (including unsecured notes and any draws under available
revolving credit facilities, the proceeds of which are intended to fund the
Required Closing Amount) (such equity, equity-linked or debt offerings,
"Additional Offerings") for all or any portion of the Financing by reducing
commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter; provided that (A) any such debt
does not mature, and to the extent any such debt has a scheduled, special or
mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to, the
earlier of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions on the Initial
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement or the Termination Date as
applicable (for the avoidance of doubt as it may be extended pursuant to this
Agreement), (B) such offering or incurrence does not result in a breach or
default under the Debt Commitment Letter, (C) the aggregate amount of the
Financing committed under the Debt Commitment Letter, together with the
unrestricted, available cash on hand of the Purchaser and such available
proceeds as of the Initial Closing Date are sufficient to pay the Required
Closing Amount, (D) such proceeds are limited in use to, and are and remain
unrestricted and available for, the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions (including the payment of the Required Closing Amount) or funded
into an escrow account with release provisions no less favorable to the
Purchaser and the Sellers in any material respect than the conditions
precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and (E) the Purchaser
promptly notifies the Sellers in reasonable detail of any such substitution
and reduction.

(b)Through the Initial Closing Date, the Sellers will use reasonable best
efforts to provide to the Purchaser, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to provide to the Purchaser, at
the Purchaser's cost and expense as provided in Section 5.8(e), in each case
subject to Sections 5.5(b) and 5.8(f), all cooperation reasonably requested by
the Purchaser that is customary and reasonably necessary in connection with
arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Financing or the financing pursuant
to Additional Offerings (collectively, the "Available Financing") and causing
the conditions in the Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied as such matters
relate to the Acquired Company and the Business (in each case, to the extent
that (1) such matters require the Sellers' cooperation and are within their or
any member of the Seller Group's control and (2) such cooperation is
customarily provided for financings of the type contemplated), including using
Sellers' reasonable best efforts in (i) assisting with the preparation of
reasonable and customary bank information memoranda and packages (confidential
and public), lender and investor presentations, rating agency materials,

reasonable and customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and
containing reasonable and customary information (all such documents and
materials, collectively, the "Offering Documents"), (ii) furnishing to the
Purchaser as promptly as reasonably practicable (A) all Required Information
and (B) all pertinent information relating

 to the Acquired Company and the Business (including their businesses and
operations) as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and that is
customarily needed for an Available Financing, including financial and other
information relating to the Acquired Company and the Business reasonably
requested by the Purchaser to allow the Purchaser to prepare historical pro
forma financial statements of the Purchaser in accordance with Regulation S-X
(regardless of whether pro forma financial information would be required to be
presented thereunder in the Offering Documents) with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, (iii) having the Sellers designate members of
senior management of the Business to participate in a reasonable number of
presentations, meetings (including a reasonable number of customary meetings
with the parties acting as lead arrangers, agents, underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents for, and prospective lenders of, the Available
Financing), due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with
ratings agencies in connection with the Available Financing or other customary
syndication activities (but not including any presentations, meetings,
sessions or other interactions with any investors in securities), all at
reasonable times and locations to be mutually agreed and upon reasonable
advance notice, (iv) (A) assisting the Purchaser in the Purchaser's
preparation of definitive financing documents (including any credit or similar
agreements and related guarantees and pledge and security agreements, and any
schedules, annexes or exhibits thereto and, subject to Section 5.8(c), any pro
forma financial statements of the Purchaser in accordance with Regulation S-X
(regardless of whether pro forma financial information would be required to be
presented thereunder in the Offering Documents) with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions, in each case, customarily delivered thereunder),
(v) subject to any contractual agreement in effect (and subject to Section
5.8(c)), assisting in the granting of security interests in collateral for the
Available Financing, including taking commercially reasonable actions
necessary to permit the Financing Sources to evaluate the Acquired Company's
and the Business's real property and current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures for the purpose of establishing
collateral arrangements, in each case, to the extent customary and not
unreasonably interfering with the business of the Sellers, (vi) assisting in
obtaining, to the extent applicable, from the Sellers' existing lenders such
consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which may be reasonably
requested by the Purchaser in connection with the Available Financing and
collateral arrangements, including obtaining customary payoff letters, lien
releases, release of guaranties, and instruments of termination or discharge,
such to be delivered at the Initial Closing, (vii) providing the Purchaser
with all documentation and other information required by regulatory
authorities, as reasonably requested by the Purchaser on behalf of Financing
Sources at least 10 Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date, with
respect to the Acquired Company and the Business in connection with applicable
"know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law
October 26, 2001), (viii) cooperating reasonably with the Financing Sources'
and their respective advisors' due diligence, including reasonable and
customary due diligence with respect to the Acquired Company and the Business
(including their businesses and operations) for any period subsequent to the
last day of the most recent fiscal period included in the Required Information

requesting its independent auditors to cooperate with the Available Financing
in a manner consistent with its reasonable and customary practices, including

Financing Sources and their respective advisors (including by participating in
a reasonable number of accounting due diligence sessions), and customary

 consents to the inclusion of audit reports in any relevant marketing
materials, registration statements and related regulatory filings (it being
understood that the assistance with respect to customary comfort letters and
customary negative assurances should not be required with respect to the
Financing under the Debt Commitment Letter) and (x) preparing and delivering
to the Purchaser any supplements to the above information as may be reasonably
required pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or the documentation pursuant
to any other Available Financing. The Purchaser shall provide the Sellers with
reasonable advance notice of any cooperation required by this Section 5.8 with
reasonable specificity. The Sellers hereby consent to the use of the
Business's logos, trademarks and service marks in connection with the
Available Financing in a form and manner mutually agreed with the Sellers;
provided, however, that such logos, trademarks and service marks are used in a
customary manner and solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably
likely, to harm or disparage the Sellers or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Sellers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, no failure to comply with this Section 5.8(b) or Section 5.12
with respect to any Additional Offering shall constitute a breach, violation,
failure to perform or other non-compliance for purposes of determining the
satisfaction of any condition for the benefit of the Purchaser set forth in
Section 6.1 or Section 6.3 or for purposes of determining the Purchaser's
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1.

(c)The Purchaser shall afford Sellers a reasonable opportunity (but not less
than two (2) Business Days) to review and comment upon the Offering Documents.
Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 5.8(b) or any other provision of
this Agreement, (i) the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for provision of
any pro forma or projected financial information, including cost savings,
synergies, capitalization, ownership, purchase accounting adjustments or other
pro forma adjustments, (ii) none of the Sellers and their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives shall be required to authorize,
approve, execute or enter into any certificate, document, agreement or
instrument (including any credit agreement, note, guaranty, security or pledge
agreement or other related agreement or document), or encumber any of their
assets, in connection with the Available Financing (other than the customary
authorization letters with respect to the provision of bank information
memoranda and the customary representation letters with respect to the
"comfort letters," each as described in Section 5.8(b)); provided that this
clause (ii) shall not prohibit the adoption or execution of any resolutions or
consents effective no earlier than the Initial Closing by any persons that
will become officers or directors of the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Initial Closing), (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall require
cooperation to the extent that it would interfere unreasonably or materially
with the business or operations of any Seller or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
of any Seller (it being agreed that contacting the customers, vendors or other
business relationships of any Seller or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any
Seller prior to the Initial Closing Date without the Sellers' consent shall
constitute unreasonable interference), or to the extent that it would require
any Seller or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Seller to take any action
that would reasonably be expected to (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) conflict with or violate any of their respective organizational
documents, any material Contract or any Law, (iv) nothing in this Agreement
shall require any Seller or any Subsidiary, Affiliate or Representative of any
Seller to provide (A) any financial statements other than the audited

(other than such financial information available to the Sellers and prepared
in the ordinary course), (D) any management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations, any compensation discussion and
analysis, any information regarding the compensation

 of directors, executive officers or key employees, any risk factors, any
forward-looking information or any other information of the types described in
Items 104 through 703 of Regulation S-K, or any similar information, or (E)
any information that is subject to the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work product doctrine or other legal privilege, (v) nothing in this Agreement
shall require any Seller or any Subsidiary, Affiliate or Representative of any
Seller to obtain an audit of any financial statements included in the Required
Information (other than the audited Financial Statements) or otherwise, except
to the extent required by Section 5.12, (vi) none of the Sellers and their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives will be required to
pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing, (vii) without limiting clause (ii) above, nothing in this
Agreement shall require cooperation or assistance from a Representative of any
Seller or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Seller to the extent such
Representative could reasonably be expected to incur any personal financial
liability by providing such cooperation or assistance that will not be repaid,
reimbursed or indemnified in full by the Purchaser and (viii) none of the
Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives
(excluding the Acquired Company on the Initial Closing Date after the Initial
Closing) shall have any liability or obligation under any credit agreement or
any related agreement or document or any other agreement or document related
to the Available Financing (including any Replacement Financing, Alternative
Financing or Additional Offering) or be required to incur any other liability
in connection therewith, other than ordinary course out-of-pocket costs and
expenses subject to reimbursement pursuant to Section 5.8(e).

(d)For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 5.8, the Purchaser acknowledges that its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereunder on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or the
consummation of the Available Financing (including any Replacement Financing,
Alternative Financing or Additional Offering) or receipt of proceeds
therefrom.

(e)The Purchaser will promptly, upon request by any Seller, reimburse the
Sellers for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees) incurred
by the Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
cooperation of the Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries contemplated by
Section 5.8(b), including in connection with the Sellers' obligations under
Section 5.12. The Purchaser will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers,
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates and the Representatives of the
Sellers and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
(including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees), interest,
awards, judgments, fines, penalties and settlement payments suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with, or in any way relating to or
arising from, the Available Financing (including any action taken in
accordance with this Section 5.8) and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any bad faith, Fraud or willful misconduct
by any such Persons.

(f)All information provided by the Sellers or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
any Seller or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section
5.8 that consists of "Confidential Information" pursuant to the NDA shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the NDA, except that the Purchaser shall
be permitted to disclose such information (i) to Financing Sources and other
lenders or potential lenders in accordance with the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter and other financial institutions and investors that are or
may become parties to the Available Financing and to any underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents in connection with any Additional Offerings, or
to their respective counsel and auditors, in each of the foregoing cases,
subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by them similar

 to those in the NDA and of which the Sellers are beneficiaries, and to rating
agencies in connection with obtaining ratings of the Available Financing and
(ii) in the Offering Documents used in connection with any Additional
Offerings.



5.9Bulk Transfer Laws. The parties (a) waive compliance with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions and (b) acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Liabilities arising out of the
failure of any member of the Seller Group to comply with the provisions of any
bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction that otherwise would
constitute Assumed Liabilities shall be treated as Excluded Liabilities.



5.10Insurance. From and after the Initial Closing and, for the avoidance of
doubt, except for insurance policies acquired directly by and in the name of
the Acquired Company or direct self-insurance programs of the Acquired
Company, the Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities and Acquired Company shall
cease to be insured by none of the Sellers' or their respective Affiliates'
insurance policies or by any of their self-insured programs.



5.11Certain Transaction Matters.

(a)From the date of this Agreement until the Final Closing Date, the Purchaser

failure of such party to comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice by the Sellers
and the information or knowledge obtained by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Section 5.11 shall not (i) affect or be deemed to affect or modify any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the applicable
Closing in Article 6 or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies
of the Purchaser hereunder, (ii) be deemed to affect or modify the Purchaser's
reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by
the Sellers in this Agreement or (iii) be deemed to amend or supplement the
Seller Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of

in defending against any such Legal Proceeding, including seeking to have
vacated or reversed any stay or temporary restraining order entered in
connection therewith by any court or other Governmental Entity.

(b)From the date of this Agreement to the Final Closing, the Sellers will (and

registration certificates, ribbon copies and patent and trademark prosecution
files and dockets for each Patent or Trademark that is an IPR, to the extent
reasonably in the possession of Sellers, their Affiliates or their respective
representatives (unless the relevant documentation is publicly available from
the United States Patent and Trademark Office or foreign equivalent) and (ii)
with respect to the litigation matters set forth on Schedule 5.14(a), opinions
of counsel (if any) and correspondence relating to such litigation matters for
the applicable Intellectual Property Assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Sellers shall not be required to search for or deliver (A) digitally-
stored electronic communications; (B) information outside the Sellers' or
their Affiliates' direct possession; (C) with respect to documents that are
exclusively related to the Business, to the extent that providing such
information will result in loss of privilege for the Purchasers; or (D) with
respect to documents or information that relate to businesses or assets of the
Seller or its Affiliates other than the Business and the Intellectual Property
Assets, where, in the Sellers' sole opinion, to do so would risk waiving an
applicable privilege or immunity, or where to do so would violate a legal
obligation of any Seller (such as under an applicable protective order or non-
disclosure agreement). Any documents or information delivered under
subparagraph (D) shall be considered Confidential Information under the NDA.

(b)EMC shall, at its own expense, pay any renewal or maintenance fee that is

with respect to any IPR included in the Acquired Assets.

(c)EMC shall take Reasonable Efforts prior to the Closing to ensure that each
Intellectual Property Registration listed on Schedule 5.14(c), or for which
the Purchaser provides EMC with specific information concerning chain of title
issues, is duly registered, issued and/or filed in the name of the applicable
Seller or Affiliate of the Seller and the correct chain of title has been
recorded with the applicable Governmental Entity.

(d)As of the applicable Closing Date, all licenses and other grants of rights
under any Intellectual Property Assets to any Seller or any Affiliate of the
Seller pursuant to any intracompany agreement will be terminated or any Seller
or any Affiliate of the Seller shall cause such licenses or grants to be
terminated; provided that, (i) for clarity, this will not affect licenses or
other rights granted under Section 10.11, the Inbound Patent License Agreement
and the Software License and Services Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding

 the above, to the extent that any such licenses or other grants of rights
under any Intellectual Property Assets are made pursuant to licenses or other
agreements that also cover other Intellectual Property, the above obligations
shall not require termination of such licenses or other agreements in whole,
but only termination of the relevant rights thereunder to the Intellectual
Property Assets.

(e)After the Initial Closing, the Sellers will abandon any domain names that
include or incorporate, and whose use would infringe as of the Initial Closing
Date, a Transferred Trademark.

(f)The Sellers will, and will cause their Affiliates to (i) as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date, but in any event within ninety (90)
days thereafter, change or cause to be changed the corporate and business
names and trade names (i.e., d/b/a) of each of the Sellers' Affiliates, to the
extent such names include or incorporate any Transferred Trademark, to a name
that does not include any Transferred Trademark and cease to refer to
themselves as, or do business under, the Transferred Trademarks or any name
that includes any of the Transferred Trademarks.

(g)Subject to the Purchaser's reasonable approval, EMC and EIC will amend the
Amended and Restated Research and Development Cost Sharing Agreement effective

licenses and obligations as licensee and EMC's rights as licensor under the
CSA, to the extent relating to the Intellectual Property Assets, into the EIC
Business IP License and (ii) limit the scope of the CSA by terminating the
rights and obligations of EMC and EIC thereunder to the extent relating to the
Intellectual Property Assets. EIC (as licensee) will make an outright
assignment of all of its rights, title and interest under the EIC Business IP
License to EISI prior to the Initial Closing pursuant to an assignment and
assumption agreement (which agreement shall be presented to the Purchaser for
its review and reasonable approval reasonably in advance of such assignment).
At the Initial Closing EISI (as licensee) will assign its rights under the EIC
Business IP License to the Purchaser at the Initial Closing pursuant to an
assignment and assumption agreement (which agreement shall be presented to the
Purchaser for its review and reasonable approval at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the Initial Closing). Any approval to be provided by the Purchaser
pursuant to this paragraph shall be provided to the Sellers within ten (10)
days after the Purchaser's receipt of the relevant document.

(h)For a period of twelve (12) months after the Initial Closing, (i) the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates will have the right at no cost to
continue internal use (in object code form only) of existing deployments of
Transferred Products to the extent necessary to meet the Sellers' internal
business needs and (ii) to receive support and maintenance services with
respect to such Transferred Products on terms that are no worse than the terms
committed to any other customer of the Purchaser. The parties will, upon the
Sellers' request, negotiate a Contract in good faith under which the Sellers
and their respective Affiliates will receive a license to use such Transferred
Products (such Contract, the "Software License and Services Agreement").

(i)For a period of twelve (12) months after the Initial Closing, the Purchaser
and its Affiliates will be permitted to use the Embedded EMC Software, as it
is used as of the Initial Closing by the Business, at no cost and on terms and
conditions no worse than those under which the Business operates (with respect
to the Embedded EMC Software) as of the date hereof. The parties will, upon
Purchaser's request, negotiate Contracts in good faith under which the
Purchaser and its Affiliates will receive a license to use such Embedded EMC
Software following such twelve (12) month period (such Contracts, the
"Embedded EMC Software License Agreements").



5.15Casualty. In the event that, between the date hereof and the applicable

enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting a material portion of the
Contemplated Transactions.

Any valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 7.1
shall become effective by the delivery of written notice by the terminating
party to the other party or parties. Each of the other Transaction Agreements
will automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 7.1 without any further action by any party.



7.2Effect of Termination. Upon valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with this Article 7, this Agreement shall become null and void and
of no further force or effect and the rights and obligations of the parties
under this Agreement shall automatically end without any Liability against any
party or its Affiliates, except that nothing in this Section 7.2 relieves any
party from Liability for any breach of any covenants set forth in this
Agreement prior to termination, and the provisions of Section 5.5
(Confidentiality), Sections 5.8(e) and (f) (Financing), this Section 7.2
(Effect of Termination), Section 7.3 (Termination Fee), and Article 11
(Miscellaneous) will remain in force and will survive any termination of this
Agreement. If the Purchaser or the Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Article 7, the Purchaser will comply with the NDA regarding the return
and/or destruction of any documents furnished to the Purchaser in connection
with this Agreement.



7.3Termination Fee.

(a)The Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers a cash payment
in an amount equal to $95,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") if, but only if,
this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser

 or the Sellers (i) pursuant to Section 7.1(e) (but only if solely as a result
of an Order issued under any Antitrust Law) or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
if, but only if, as of the Termination Date, one or more of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(a) has not been satisfied (but only if the failure to
meet such condition arises solely under any Antitrust Law) and all of the
other conditions to effect the Initial Closing set forth in Article 6 have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Initial Closing provided such conditions would have been satisfied as of such
date). The Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers the Termination Fee, which shall
be allocated between EMC and EIC as set forth in Schedule 2.1, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account (or accounts) designated
by the Sellers promptly but in no event later than five (5) Business Days
after the date of such termination.

(b)The parties acknowledge that (i) the agreement contained in this Section
7.3 is an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) the amount of,
and the basis for payment of, the fee described herein is reasonable and
appropriate in all respects and (iii) without this agreement, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Purchaser fails to
pay in a timely manner the Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Sellers make a claim that results in a judgment against the
Purchaser for payment of the Termination Fee, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Sellers the Sellers' reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and costs of
counsel) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
(in each case from the date payment of such amount was due through the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made). All payments under
this Section 7.3(b) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account (or accounts) designated by the Sellers.

(c)For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by the Purchaser under this
Section 7.3 shall be payable only once with respect to this Section 7.3 and
not in duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) if the
Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a), the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers against the Purchaser or any Financing
Sources, or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
(collectively, the "Purchaser Related Parties") for any Damages suffered as a
result thereof or relating to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement, any of the Contemplated Transactions,
or the Debt Commitment Letter shall be the right to receive payment of the
Termination Fee (and the expenses and interest, if any, contemplated by the
second sentence of Section 7.3(b)) as and only to the extent provided by
Section 7.3(a) and Section 7.3(b); and (ii) upon the indefeasible payment of
the Termination Fee in full, none of the Purchaser Related Parties will have
any further liability or obligation of any kind for any reason relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements, or the
Contemplated Transactions. The election of the Sellers to pursue an injunction
or specific performance in accordance with Section 11.12 shall not restrict,
impair or otherwise limit the Sellers from subsequently seeking to terminate
this Agreement and collect the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a);
provided, however, that under no circumstances shall the Sellers be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions pursuant to Section 11.12 and
the payment of the Termination Fee and/or any amounts pursuant to this Section
7.3.











ARTICLE 8

INDEMNIFICATION



8.1Indemnification by EMC. Following the Initial Closing, and subject to the
limitations expressly set forth in Section 8.5, EMC (or its substitute
pursuant to Section 8.9) will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Purchaser, its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, and agents (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and
against any and all Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees arising out
of or resulting from the following:

(a)any inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Representation or any
representation or warranty of any member of the Seller Group set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement or the Existing Customer Reseller Agreement (or
any certificate delivered by any member of the Seller Group or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant hereto or thereto);

(b)any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers set forth in this
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing Customer Reseller
Agreement; and

(c)any Excluded Liability; and

(d)any Claim made by the Taxing Authority under the provisions of Section 281
of the (Indian) Income-tax Act, 1961 (as amended from time to time) against
the Business or any of the Acquired Assets which have been transferred to the
Purchaser Group on account of the non-payment of any Taxes or any other sum
payable by the Sellers or their Affiliates to the relevant Taxing Authority in
India; provided, however, that if prior to the date described in Section
2.2(b)(ii), the Sellers obtain and provide to the Purchaser a tax clearance
certificate from the assessing officer under proviso (ii) of Section 281(1) of
the (Indian) Income-tax Act, 1961 (as amended from time to time) and such
certificate is valid as of the date described in Section 2.2(b)(ii), the
rights of the Purchaser under this Section 8.1(d) shall cease on the date
described in Section 2.2(b)(ii).



8.2Indemnification by the Purchaser. Following the Initial Closing, and
subject to the limitations expressly set forth in Section 8.5, the Purchaser
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnitees") from and against any and all Damages incurred by the
Seller Indemnitees arising out of or resulting from the following:

(a)any inaccuracy in or breach of any Purchaser Representation or any
representation or warranty of any member of the Purchaser Group set forth in
the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing Customer Reseller Agreement
(or any certificate delivered by any member of the Purchaser Group or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant hereto or thereto);

 (b)any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing Customer Reseller
Agreement; and

(c)any Assumed Liability.



8.3Claim Procedure.

(a)Claim Notice. A party which seeks indemnity under this Article 8 (an
"Indemnified Party") will give prompt written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
party from whom indemnification is sought (an "Indemnifying Party"). The Claim
Notice shall contain (i) a description and, if known, estimated amount (the
"Claimed Amount") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be
incurred by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a reasonable explanation of the basis
for the Claim Notice to the extent of facts then known by the Indemnified
Party (including any supporting documents required by Section 8.3(d)), and
(iii) a demand for payment of those Damages; provided that the failure to give
such Claim Notice shall not affect the rights of the Indemnified Party
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
materially prejudiced by reason of such failure; and provided, further, that
any such Claim Notice shall not limit or prejudice any of the rights or
remedies of any Indemnified Party on the basis of any limitations on the
information included in such Claim Notice, including any such limitations made
in good faith to preserve the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or any other privilege, unless such limitations materially and adversely
prejudice the Indemnifying Party.

(b)Response to Notice of Claim. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of a
Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written response (the "Response") in which the Indemnifying Party will:

(i)agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, and, within five (5) Business Days of the Indemnified Party's receipt
of the Response, the Indemnifying Party will pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnified Party in accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;

(ii)agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all,
of the Claimed Amount (such portion, the "Agreed Portion"), and, within five
(5) Business Days of the Indemnified Party's receipt of the Response, the
Indemnifying Party will pay the Agreed Portion to the Indemnified Party in
accordance with a payment and distribution method reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party; or

(iii)dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount.

If no Response is delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
within such thirty (30)-day period, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have accepted the Indemnified Party's right to receive the Claimed
Amount.

(c)Contested Claims. In the event that the Indemnifying Party disputes the
Claimed Amount (or the portion of the Claimed Amount not comprising the Agreed
Portion), such dispute will be governed by, and subject to the terms of,
Section 11.1, except with respect to disputes relating to Taxes, which are
governed by Section 9.6 and Section 9.7.

 (d)Third Party Claims.

(i)Except with respect to claims relating to Taxes, which are governed by
Sections 9.6 and 9.7, in the event that the Indemnified Party receives notice
or otherwise learns of the assertion by a Person other than a Purchaser
Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee of any claim, suit, audit or other proceeding
with respect to which the Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide
indemnification under this Article 8 (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified
Party will provide a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party as soon as
practicable but in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter. Such Claim
Notice will be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by
such Third Party (to the extent then in the possession of the Indemnified
Party) and will describe in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis
for such claim, suit, audit or proceeding and the amount of the claimed
damages (in each case to the extent known or reasonably ascertainable by the
Indemnified Party); provided, however, that no delay or deficiency on the part
of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party's ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect
to such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced thereby.

(ii)Within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification pursuant to
Section 8.3(d)(i), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake,
by counsel or other Representatives of its own choosing (provided such counsel
or other Representative is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party),
the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole
expense; provided, however, that such Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to control the defense of any Third Party Claim that (i) seeks any
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, or (ii)
seeks monetary damages the amount of which would reasonably be expected to
exceed any limitation on the amount of Damages for which the Indemnifying
Party is responsible hereunder. In the event that (A) the Indemnifying Party
shall elect not to undertake such defense; or (B) the Indemnifying Party shall
fail to undertake to defend such Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the Claim Notice by the Indemnified Party of such Third
Party Claim or thereafter fail to diligently pursue or maintain such defense,
then the Indemnified Party (upon further notice to the Indemnifying Party)
shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise and/or settlement of
such Third Party Claim, by counsel or other Representatives of its own
choosing, on behalf of and without limiting the indemnification obligations of
the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

(iii)The party not controlling such defense of a Third Party Claim (the "Non-
Controlling Party") may participate therein at its own expense, subject to any
limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege
or third party confidentiality. The party controlling such defense (the
"Controlling Party") will keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably advised of
the status of such claim, suit, audit or proceeding and the defense thereof
(subject to any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any
applicable privilege or Third Party confidentiality), and will consider in
good faith recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party with respect
thereto. The Non-Controlling Party will, subject to any limitations that are
reasonably required to preserve any applicable privilege or Third Party
confidentiality, furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may
have with respect

 to such claim, suit, audit or proceeding (including copies of any summons,
complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any
written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same) and will otherwise reasonably cooperate with and assist
the Controlling Party in the defense of such claim, suit, audit or proceeding.

(iv)The Indemnifying Party will not agree (or allow any Affiliate to agree) to
any settlement or compromise of or consent to the entry of any Order arising
from, any such claim, suit, audit or proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that the consent of the Indemnified
Party will not be required if (A) the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to
pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement, compromise or Order, (B)
such settlement, compromise or Order includes a full, complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from further Liability with
respect to such claim, suit, audit or proceeding, and (C) such settlement,
compromise or Order does not impose any injunctive relief or operational
restrictions on the Indemnified Party or admit to any wrongdoing by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party.

(v)The Indemnified Party will not agree (or allow any Affiliate to agree) to
any settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any Order arising
from, any such claim, suit, audit or proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.



8.4Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All Seller
Representations and Purchaser Representations shall survive the Initial
Closing, and continue in full force and effect: (a) in the case of a Seller
Fundamental Representation, a Purchaser Fundamental Representation or the
Seller Representations set forth in Section 3.15 (Environmental Matters),
until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extensions or waivers thereof), and (b) in the case
of any other Seller Representation or Purchaser Representation, for a period
of fifteen (15) months after the Initial Closing Date. Except as otherwise
noted elsewhere within this Agreement, each of the agreements and covenants of
the parties to this Agreement that are intended to survive the Initial
Closing, shall survive the Initial Closing and continue in full force and
effect until fully performed.



8.5Limitations.

(a)Liability of EMC. The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.1(a) (except with respect to any inaccuracy in
or breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation) until the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall have incurred (i) with respect to any particular claim
(taken together with other claims arising out of the same or related
circumstances or set of facts ("Related Claims")), Damages in excess of
$275,000 (such amount, the "Minimum Per Claim Amount"), and (ii) as to all
claims, Damages in excess of $10,000,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to
the extent such Damages exceed the Deductible. Damages related to Related
Claims asserted by the Purchaser Indemnitees that do not meet the Minimum Per
Claim Amount shall not count toward the Deductible. EMC's aggregate Liability
for Damages arising under Section 8.1(a) (except with respect to any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation) will not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price (the "Representations

 and Warranties Cap"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, except to the extent of any Liability for Damages arising out of any
Seller's Fraud, the aggregate amount of all Damages for which EMC shall be
liable under this Article 8 shall not exceed the Purchase Price.

(b)Liability of the Purchaser. The Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.2(a) (except with respect to any inaccuracy in
or breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation) until the Seller
Indemnitees shall have incurred (i) with respect to any Related Claims,
Damages in excess of the Minimum Per Claim Amount, and (ii) as to all such
claims, Damages in excess of the Deductible, and then only to the extent such
Damages exceed the Deductible. Damages related to Related Claims asserted by
the Seller Indemnitees that do not meet the Minimum Per Claim Amount shall not
count toward the Deductible. The Purchaser's aggregate Liability for Damages
arising under Section 8.2(a) (except with respect to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any Purchaser Fundamental Representation) will not exceed the
Representations and Warranties Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, except to the extent of any Liability for Damages arising
out of the Purchaser's Fraud, the aggregate amount of all Damages for which
the Purchaser shall be liable under this Article 8 shall not exceed the
Purchase Price.

(c)Insurance Proceeds. The amount of any and all Damages for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to this Article 8 will be net of any
insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
(in each case, calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves,
expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or retrospectively rated premiums
incorrect or paid to procure such recoveries) actually received by the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages or any of the circumstances
giving rise thereto. The Indemnified Party shall use its Reasonable Efforts to
recover under insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements for any Damages.

(d)Other Limitations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under
any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or
its Affiliate has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any
other provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement. The
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all
reasonable steps required by applicable Law to mitigate any Damage upon
becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected
to, or does, give rise to such Damage, including incurring reasonable costs
only to the minimum extent required by applicable Law to remedy or mitigate
the breach that gives rise to such Damage (which such costs shall be the
obligation of the Indemnifying Party).

(e)Materiality Scrape. For the purposes of determining whether a breach of
representation or warranty has occurred for the purposes of Section 8.1(a) and
calculating the amount of Damages payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article 8, any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect
(or any other similar qualification or standard) contained in the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement at issue shall be disregarded
(it being understood that the word "Material" in the defined terms "Material
Contract(s)", "Material Customer Contract(s)" and "Material Vendor
Contract(s)" and the qualification as to "Material Adverse Effect" contained
in Sections 3.21(a) and (b) shall in each case not be disregarded for any of
such purposes).



8.6Exclusive Remedy.

 (a)Except in the case of Fraud and as otherwise set forth herein (including
Section 11.12), following the Initial Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy
of any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty or any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing
Customer Reseller Agreement will be pursuant to the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 8.1; provided, however, that the foregoing
will not prohibit the Purchaser from seeking injunctive relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or to specifically
enforce this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing
Customer Reseller Agreement or any of the terms or provisions hereof or
thereof.

(b)Except in the case of Fraud and as otherwise set forth herein (including
Section 11.12), following the Initial Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy
of any Seller Indemnitee with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty or any breach of any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing
Customer Reseller Agreement will be pursuant to the indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 8.2; provided, however, that the foregoing
will not prohibit the Seller from seeking injunctive relief from a court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent any failure or breach or to specifically
enforce this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing
Customer Reseller Agreement or any of the terms or provisions hereof or
thereof.



8.7Exercise of Remedies by Persons Other than the Parties. No Purchaser
Indemnitee (other than the Purchaser or any successor or permitted assignee of
the Purchaser) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this
Agreement unless the Purchaser (or any successor or permitted assignee of the
Purchaser) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim. No Seller
Indemnitee (other than a Seller or any successor or permitted assignee of such
Seller) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this Agreement
unless the Sellers (or any successor or permitted assignee of the Sellers, as
applicable) consents to the assertion of the indemnification claim.



8.8Tax Treatment. Any payment made pursuant to this Article 8 or any other
indemnity provisions or covenants contained in this Agreement will be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, except to the extent otherwise
required by applicable Law, and shall be allocated to the extent legally
possible to the Acquired Assets (or particular category of the Acquired
Assets) to which the payment relates.



8.9Indemnitor Substitute. In the event that EMC or any of its successors or
assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (b) transfers or conveys fifty percent (50%) or more of its properties and
other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that such successors, assigns or transferees shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Article 8.



8.10Characterization of Claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 8 to
the contrary, if any Person's claim under this Article 8 may be properly
characterized in multiple ways in accordance with this Article 8 such that
such claim may or may not be subject to different caps, time limitations,
deductibles, and other limitations depending on such characterization, then
such Person shall have the

 right to characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery and
time to assert claims permitted in accordance with this Article 8.



ARTICLE 9

TAX MATTERS



9.1Straddle Periods; Transfer Charges; VAT.

(a) 

(i)With respect to Taxes or Tax items of the Acquired Company or relating to
the Acquired Assets for any Straddle Period that are real or personal ad
valorem property Taxes, or depreciation allowances calculated on an annual or
periodic basis, the parties agree that such Taxes or Tax items will be
allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Initial Closing Date and the portion beginning on the day after the
Initial Closing Date by apportioning a pro-rata portion of such Taxes or Tax
items to each day in the relevant Straddle Period.

(ii)With respect to any Taxes of the Acquired Company that are based upon or
relate to income or receipts, for any Straddle Period, the parties agree that
(A) such Taxes will be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Initial Closing Date and the portion beginning on
the day after the Initial Closing Date based on a closing of the books of the
Acquired Company as of the end of the Initial Closing Date, and (B) Tax items
resulting from activities or transactions on the Initial Closing Date, but
after the Initial Closing, that are not contemplated by this Agreement or in
the Ordinary Course or otherwise result from actions described in Section 9.9.
will be treated as occurring on the day after the Initial Closing Date.

(b)Any applicable transfer, stamp, stock transfer, sales, use, consumption,
business, gross receipts, withholding, or excise tax, or any custom duty, or
similar Taxes, fees and charges (excluding for this purpose, (i) any Tax
imposed or assessed on income or gains, (ii) any VAT and (iii) any Canadian
withholding Tax) that are or become due and payable as a result of the
Contemplated Transactions, and all related interest or penalties, whether such
Taxes, fees or charges are imposed by Law on the Acquired Company, the other
Acquired Assets, the Seller Group or the Purchaser Group (such Taxes, fees and
charges, the "Transfer Charges"), shall be borne solely by the Purchaser until
the aggregate amount of all such Transfer Charges borne by the Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) equals one million Dollars ($1,000,000), and
thereafter shall be borne equally by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers on the other. The party with primary responsibility for such Transfer
Charges, under applicable Law shall pay such Transfer Charges to the
appropriate Taxing Authority, shall prepare valid invoices required under
applicable Law and shall be reimbursed by the other party for the portion of
such Transfer Charges allocable to such other party under this Section 9.1(b).
The parties shall cooperate with each other in minimizing the amount of (i)
any Transfer Charges, and (ii) any VAT that may become payable as a result of
one or more of the Contemplated Transactions being treated as a sale or supply
for VAT purposes, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law
(including the provision of any information or preparation of any
documentation that may be necessary or useful for obtaining any available
mitigation, reduction or exemption from any such Transfer Charges or VAT). Any
Tax Returns or other documents that are required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity with

 respect to any Transfer Charges or VAT shall be prepared and filed by the
party that has primary responsibility for filing such Tax Returns or other
documents pursuant to the applicable Law.

(c)The Purchase Price is exclusive of any applicable VAT. If any VAT is
chargeable on any supply of Acquired Assets by a Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) (including under a Local Asset Transfer Agreement) and that Seller
(or any of its Affiliates) is the person required to account to the relevant
Taxing Authority for that VAT, then the Purchaser (or the relevant Affiliate
of the Purchaser) shall pay to that Seller (or the relevant Affiliate of the
Seller) the amount of that VAT (or, if and only if any of the VAT in question
is Irrecoverable VAT, an amount equal to P minus Q where "P" is the amount of
the VAT and "Q" is equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the
Irrecoverable VAT) in addition to the Main Purchaser Payments, or relevant
Local Purchaser Payment, as applicable, and subject to that Seller (or its
Affiliate, as applicable) having issued to the Purchaser (or its Affiliate),
as applicable, a valid VAT invoice in respect of that VAT, such amount to be
paid at the same time as the Main Purchaser Payments, or relevant Local
Purchaser Payment, as applicable, is due for payment unless no such valid VAT
invoice has been issued at that time, in which case such amount shall be paid
within five (5) Business Days after the issue of such a valid VAT invoice. For
the purposes of this Section 9.1, "Irrecoverable VAT" means VAT in respect of
which neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates is able to make a
recovery from the relevant Taxing Authority (whether by way of credit or
repayment), as demonstrated, to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant
Seller (or Affiliate of the Seller), by the Purchaser (or relevant Affiliate
of the Purchaser).

(d)If any VAT is chargeable on any supply of Acquired Assets by a Seller (or
any of its Affiliates) (including under a Local Asset Transfer Agreement) and
the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) is the person required to account to
the relevant Taxing Authority for that VAT, then if and only if any of the VAT
in question is Irrecoverable VAT, the relevant Seller shall pay to the
Purchaser an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the
Irrecoverable VAT), such amount to be paid within five (5) Business Days after
the Purchaser has demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant
Seller (or its Affiliate) that the VAT in question is or includes
Irrecoverable VAT and, where applicable, what amount of that VAT is
Irrecoverable VAT.

(e)If, at any time after the Initial Closing Date, the Purchaser or any Seller
becomes aware (as a result of the determination of a Taxing Authority or
otherwise) that the VAT treatment in relation to any of the Contemplated
Transactions was incorrect to any extent, it shall notify the other parties as
soon as reasonably practicable. In such event, the Sellers and the Purchaser
shall cooperate with each other and use all Reasonable Efforts to put each of
the Sellers and Purchaser (and/or their relevant Affiliates, as applicable)
back into the positions that they would have been in pursuant to this
Agreement had the correct VAT treatment been applied from the outset (and such
Reasonable Efforts shall include, where applicable, issuing VAT invoices,
making payments in respect of VAT to the other party, or pursuing any VAT
refund or credit obtainable from a Taxing Authority, and (if obtained) passing
on the benefit of such a refund or credit).

(f)Where under the terms of this Agreement or a Local Asset Transfer Agreement
one party is liable to indemnify or reimburse another party in respect of
costs, charges or expenses, the payment shall include an amount equal to any
VAT thereon not otherwise recoverable by the other party or the representative
member of any VAT group of which it forms part, subject to that party or
representative member using all Reasonable Efforts to recover such amount of
VAT as may be practicable.

(g)If any payment under this Agreement or a Local Asset Transfer Agreement in
respect of any indemnity, reimbursement or compensation provision or in
respect of a breach of representation

 constitutes the consideration for a taxable supply for VAT purposes, then in
addition to that payment the payer shall pay any VAT due, in the currency in
which the VAT in question must be accounted for to the relevant Taxing
Authority, subject, unless the reverse charge procedure applies, to provision
of a valid VAT invoice (or equivalent) in respect thereof, if applicable.



9.2Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a)The initial allocation of the Purchase Price between EMC and EIC is set
forth in Schedule 2.1(a). The further allocation of the Purchase Price, among
(i) the jurisdictions where the Acquired Assets are located, and (ii) the
members of the Seller Group that will sell and assign the Acquired Assets to
the Purchaser Group, will be determined under the methodologies set forth in
Schedule 9.2(a). The parties hereby agree that the Purchase Price, as adjusted
(including for purposes of this Section 9.2, any other items required to be
included under the Code, and any other consideration paid to any Seller for
Income Tax purposes, including the relevant portion of Assumed Liabilities),
shall be allocated first among the Sellers and the Sellers' Affiliates, and
then among the Acquired Assets (including the Acquired Company Shares) in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (and any similar Tax Law, as appropriate).

(b)From the date of this Agreement until the Initial Closing, the Sellers and
the Purchaser shall consult with one another in good faith with respect to
each jurisdiction where the Acquired Assets are located and have agreed upon
the relevant valuation methodology by which the Acquired Assets in each
jurisdiction will be valued (as set forth in Schedule 9.2(a)). The Sellers and
the Purchaser shall also consult with one another in good faith with a view to
determining the extent to which the Contemplated Transactions will be subject
to VAT and/or Transfer Charges in any jurisdiction.

(c)No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing, the
Sellers shall provide a statement (the "Initial Allocation Statement")
allocating the Purchase Price among (i) the jurisdictions where the Acquired
Assets are located, and (ii) the members of the Seller Group that will sell
and assign the Acquired Assets to the Purchaser Group. The Purchaser shall
provide Sellers with any comments regarding the Initial Allocation Statement
no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing, and the
Sellers shall consider such comments in good faith and promptly notify the
Purchaser if the Sellers have not accepted any such comments.

(d)Within ninety (90) Business Days following the Initial Closing Date, the
Sellers, in accordance with the methodology agreed upon by the parties
pursuant to Section 9.2(b), will prepare and send to the Purchaser for its
review and comment an allocation statement that reflects the Purchase Price,
Acquired Assets, Assumed Liabilities and other relevant information, as of the
Initial Closing (the "Revised Allocation Statement"). The Sellers shall keep
the Purchaser reasonably informed, from the date of this Agreement until the
delivery thereof, regarding the progress of the preparation of the Revised
Allocation Statement and the valuations reflected therein, and shall consider
in good faith any comments from the Purchaser provided during such period
regarding such valuations.

(e)If the Purchaser disagrees with any item in the Revised Allocation
Statement, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of such disagreement in
writing within thirty (30) Business Days following the receipt thereof. The
Sellers will consider the Purchaser's comments to the Revised Allocation
Statement in good faith. The Sellers will notify the Purchaser in writing of
any comments that they have not accepted

 with ten (10) Business Days of receiving the Purchaser's comments. The Sellers
and the Purchaser will negotiate in good faith to come to an agreement with
respect to any such comments not accepted by the Sellers. If the Purchaser and
the Sellers cannot reach an agreement with respect to any disputed item on the
Revised Allocation Statement, such disagreement shall be resolved pursuant to
Section 9.7 hereof. The final decision of the Tax Arbitrator under Section 9.7
(or if the Purchaser does not object to any item in the Revised Allocation
Statement) shall be referred to as the "Final Allocation Statement" subject to
any further adjustments reasonably required to be made and which are agreed
upon by the parties, which adjusted allocation shall become the Final
Allocation Statement.

(f)Unless otherwise required by a determination of a Taxing Authority that is
final, each of the parties and their respective Affiliates shall report, act
and file Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Final Allocation Statement, pursuant to Section
9.2(d).

(g)Subject to Section 9.2(b), the parties shall make appropriate adjustments
to any allocation (whether or not a Final Allocation Statement) to reflect any
adjustments to the Purchase Price. In the event there is an adjustment to the
Purchase Price and the original Purchase Price was included in a Transfer
Charge invoice or Tax Return or other document relating to Transfer Charges,
the Purchaser and the Sellers will amend, if necessary, such invoice or Tax
Return and the obligation and rights of the Purchaser and the Sellers pursuant
to Section 9.2(b) shall control with respect to such amended invoice or Tax
Return.

(h)Notwithstanding the foregoing, but solely to the extent the Purchaser and
the Sellers are required by applicable Law or Order to agree on the amount or
value of a particular Acquired Asset for purposes of any Transfer Charges, the
Purchaser and the Sellers will mutually agree on a good faith estimate of the
fair market value of such asset prior to the date any Tax Return or other
document relating to Transfer Charges is required to be filed or any such
Transfer Charge payment is required to be paid (including applicable
extensions). The Purchaser and the Sellers understand and agree that any
agreement reached pursuant to this Section 9.2(h) will in no way be regarded
by the parties as conclusive with respect to the allocation described in
Sections 9.2(a) and (b) unless required under applicable Law or Order.



9.3Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any cash Tax refund and any credit claimed in
lieu of a cash Tax refund (including any interest paid by a Taxing Authority
with respect thereto) relating to Excluded Taxes will be the property of the
Sellers, and if received by the Purchaser or the Acquired Company or one of
its Affiliates, will be paid over promptly to the Sellers. The Purchaser will,
if the Sellers so request, cause the Acquired Company to file for and use
Reasonable Efforts to obtain and expedite the receipt of any refund to which a
Seller is entitled under this Section 9.3. The Purchaser will permit the
Sellers to participate in the prosecution of any such refund claim. Payments
to the Sellers under this Section 9.3 shall be net of (1) any reasonable out-
of-pocket costs associated in obtaining such refund of Taxes, and (2) any
Taxes actually imposed on the Purchaser and/or the Acquired Company as a
result of such refunds. To the extent a withholding Tax is imposed on such
payments, the Purchaser (or the Acquired Company or its designees) shall be
entitled to withhold from such payments pursuant to Section 9.12. Any cash Tax
refund and any credit claimed in lieu of a cash Tax refund (including any
interest paid by a Taxing Authority with respect thereto) relating to Tax
payments made for Post-Closing Periods will be the property of the Purchaser,
and if received by the Sellers, will be paid over promptly to the Purchaser.
If there is a subsequent reduction by a Taxing Authority of any amounts with
respect to which a payment has been made pursuant to this Section 9.3, then
the recipient of amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.3 shall pay the
Purchaser or the Acquired Company or the

 Sellers, as applicable, an amount equal to such reduction plus any interest or
penalties imposed by the Taxing Authority with respect to such reduction.



9.4Cooperation. In addition to the parties' agreements under Section 10.3,
each of the Sellers and the Purchaser agree that it will (and will cause its
respective Affiliates to, as applicable):

(a)Provide assistance to the other party as reasonably requested in preparing
and filing Tax Returns, responding to Tax Contests, and recovering any
Transfer Charge, in each case, relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired
Company, the other Acquired Assets, or the Business, including making
available to the other party, as reasonably requested, all information,
records and documents relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Company, the
Acquired Assets and the Business (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
including such portions of any information, records or documents relating to
Taxes that do not relate primarily to the Acquired Company, the other Acquired
Assets or the Business);

(b)Retain any Tax Returns and other books and records that could reasonably be
expected to be necessary or useful in connection with any preparation or
filing by any other party of any Tax Returns concerning the Acquired Company,
the other Acquired Assets or the Business, or any Tax Contest or other
examination or proceeding relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Company,
the other Acquired Assets or the Business. Such books and records will be
retained until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including extensions thereof);

(c)Execute any powers of attorney or other documents that will allow the
Sellers or the Purchaser, as applicable, to take control of a Tax Contest as
contemplated by Section 9.6; and

(d)Use Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions under this Agreement).



9.5Tax Returns and Tax Payments.

(a)The Sellers, at their sole cost and expense, shall prepare and timely file,
or cause to be prepared and timely filed, (i) all Tax Returns of, or that
include, the Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Periods ending on or prior
to the Initial Closing Date (other than a Tax Return described in Section
9.5(b)), and (ii) any Tax Returns with respect to Seller Combined Taxes. Not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date (after applicable extensions)
of any Tax Return described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, the
Sellers shall submit such Tax Return for the Purchaser's review and comment.
The Sellers shall consider the Purchaser's comments with respect to such Tax
Returns in good faith. The Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes
shown as due on such Tax Returns, and the Purchaser shall reasonably assist in
causing such Tax Returns to be filed, as necessary.

(b)All Tax Returns of the Acquired Company that relate to a Straddle Period
shall be prepared, or caused to be prepared, by (i) the Sellers if the Initial
Closing occurs on or prior to December 31, 2016, or (ii) the Purchaser if the
Initial Closing occurs after December 31, 2016. The party with the
responsibility for preparing such Tax Returns pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence shall, at its sole cost and expense, prepare, or cause to
be prepared, all such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past
practices of the Acquired Company, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Not less than thirty (30)

 days prior to the due date (after applicable extensions) of any such Tax
Return, the party that prepared such Tax Return shall submit such Tax Return,
together with a proposed calculation, in accordance with Section 9.1(a), of
the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that are allocable to a Pre-Closing
Period and a Post-Closing Period, for the other party's review, comment and
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. The party that prepared such Tax Returns shall consider the other
party's comments with respect to such Tax Returns in good faith and accept the
other party's reasonable comments. If any dispute with respect to such a Tax
Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return (after
applicable extensions), such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner first
presented by the party that prepared such Tax Return, modified to include any
of the other party's reasonable comments that were accepted by the party that
prepared such Tax Return pursuant to this Section 9.5(b) and, promptly after
the filing of such Tax Return, the parties shall submit their dispute to the
Tax Arbitrator pursuant to Section 9.7 and, once resolution of such dispute
has been determined pursuant to Section 9.7, such Tax Return shall be amended,
if necessary, to include the final resolution of such dispute. The Purchaser
shall timely file any Tax Returns described in this Section 9.5(b) and timely
pay any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns. No less than two (2) Business
Days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return (after applicable
extensions), the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser (in immediately available
funds) the amount of any Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that is
allocable to a Pre-Closing Period.

(c)The Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns for (or with respect to) the
Acquired Company that are required to be filed after the Initial Closing Date
that relate to a tax period that begins after the Initial Closing Date, and
shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, all Taxes payable with respect
to each such Tax Return.

(d)The provisions set forth in Section 9.5(a)-(c) are intended to describe the
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the preparation and filing of
Tax Returns and the payment of Taxes. Section 9.1(a) shall control the
parties' respective liabilities with respect to Taxes on such Tax Returns and
Article 8 shall control with respect to the parties' respective
indemnification obligations with respect to liability for Taxes under this
Agreement.



9.6Tax Contests.

(a)After the Initial Closing, each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other party in writing
upon receipt of any written notice of any pending or threatened Tax Contest
with respect to the Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Period or any Damages
for which such other party (or any of its Affiliates) could be liable pursuant
to this Agreement.

(b)The Sellers shall control the defense of all Tax Contests relating to Taxes
or Tax Returns within the scope of Section 9.5(a); provided, however, that the
Sellers (i) shall keep the Purchaser fully informed regarding any such Tax
Contest to the extent it relates to the Acquired Company, and (ii) shall not
settle or compromise any such Tax Contest that could reasonably be expected to
result in the Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Acquired Company being liable
for any additional Taxes, without the consent of the Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c)The Sellers shall (at the expense of the Sellers), control the defense of
all Tax Contests in respect of any Canadian withholding Tax imposed on or
otherwise required to be paid by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
respect of any amount paid or payable or credited or creditable by the
Purchaser or

 any of its Affiliates pursuant to, or contemplated by, this Agreement for the
assignment of the EIC Business IP License to the Purchaser or the EIC Business
IP License; provided, however, that (i) the Sellers shall keep the Purchaser
fully informed regarding any such Tax Contest, and (ii) the Purchaser and its
counsel (at the expense of the Purchaser) may participate in (but not control
the conduct of) the defense of any such Tax Contest. The Sellers may settle or
compromise the portion of any such Tax Contest that the Sellers are entitled
to control pursuant to this Section 9.6(c), provided that the Sellers shall
not settle or compromise any such Tax Contest (or portion thereof) in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to result in the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates being liable for any additional Taxes without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. To the extent a Tax Contest relates in part to the
Canadian withholding Taxes described above and in part to other Taxes, the
Sellers shall have the right to control and settle only such portion of the
Tax Contest that exclusively relates to such Canadian withholding Taxes. In
the case of any assessment or reassessment or similar claim received by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of the Canadian withholding
Taxes described above, the Sellers shall, within fifteen (15) days of receipt
of written notice of such claim, pay to the Purchaser (or its Affiliate, as
designated by the Purchaser) the full amount of such Taxes (including for
greater certainty penalties and interest) to be remitted to the applicable
Governmental Entity. Upon the final determination of any such matter, the
Sellers shall pay any such additional Taxes that may be required to be paid in
respect of such matter. To the extent that the amount of such Taxes paid by
the Sellers to the Purchaser or the Purchaser's Affiliates in respect of a
matter exceeds the amount finally determined to be the amount of the Taxes
required to be indemnified by the Sellers, the Purchaser or the applicable
Purchaser's Affiliate shall pay to the Sellers the amount of such excess.

(d)The Purchaser shall control the defense of all Tax Contests relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns within the scope of Section 9.5(b); provided, however,
that (i) the Sellers and their counsel (at the expense of the Sellers) may
participate in (but not control the conduct of) the defense of any such Tax
Contest, and, (ii) the Purchaser may not settle or compromise any such Tax
Contest covered by the preceding clause (i) without the consent of the
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(e)The Purchaser shall control the defense of all Tax Contests relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns within the scope of Section 9.5(c); provided, however,
that the Purchaser shall keep the Sellers fully informed regarding any such
Tax Contest to the extent it relates to the Acquired Company and could
reasonably be expected to result in any Seller, or any of the Sellers'
Affiliates, being liable for any additional Taxes, and in such case shall not
settle or compromise such Tax Contest, without the consent of the Sellers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Any dispute, controversy or claim between the Purchaser and the Sellers with
respect to the defense of any Tax Contest, as described in this Section 9.6,
shall be resolved pursuant to Section 9.7.

9.7Dispute Resolution for Taxes. With respect to any dispute, controversy or
claim relating to Taxes between the Purchaser and the Sellers or the Acquired
Company (prior to the Initial Closing), or between the Purchaser and the
Sellers (for any Tax for which an indemnity claim may exist), the Purchaser
and the Sellers or the Acquired Company, as applicable, shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve such dispute, controversy or claim between them for a
period of thirty (30) days from the date written notice of such dispute,
controversy or claim is received by the Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case
may be; but if the applicable parties are unable to resolve such dispute,
controversy or claim, the parties shall submit the dispute,

 controversy or claim for resolution, which resolution shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties, to a mutually agreed upon national
accounting firm or a mutually agreed upon tax lawyer who is a partner in a law
firm, that, in each case, is: (a) familiar with transactions or operations of
the sort at issue; and (b) independent with respect to each party (such
accounting firm or such tax lawyer, the "Tax Arbitrator"). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the fees and expenses of the Tax
Arbitrator relating to any dispute as to the amount of Taxes owed shall be
paid by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, in
proportion to each party's respective liability for the portion of the Taxes
in dispute, as determined by the Tax Arbitrator.



9.8Tax Elections. The Purchaser shall either: (i) file, or cause the Acquired
Company to file, an entity classification election pursuant to Section 7701 of
the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder for the Acquired Company to
be treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
effective immediately after the applicable Closing Date with respect to the
Acquired Company; or (ii) make an election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the
Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder with respect to the acquisition
of the stock of the Acquired Company pursuant to this Agreement, in which case
the Purchaser shall take all actions necessary and appropriate (including
filing such forms, elections, schedules, Tax Returns and other documents as
may be required) to effect and preserve a timely election under Section 338(g)
of the Code, and fulfill all applicable notice requirements set forth in
Treasury regulations Section 1.338-2(e)(4). In any event, promptly after
filing such election with the IRS, the Purchaser shall furnish the Sellers
with a copy of the election, as filed.



9.9Activities After the Initial Closing. Following the Initial Closing, except
as required by applicable Law or Order or with the prior consent of the
Sellers (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
the Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Company) to (a) file an amended Tax Return for the Acquired
Company for a Pre-Closing Period (or Straddle Period) or (b) make, revoke, or
change any material Tax election, in each case if such action could reasonably
be expected to result directly in the Acquired Company incurring any Tax for a
Pre-Closing Period (or Straddle Period) or could reasonably be expected to
result directly in any Seller (or any of its respective Affiliates) paying any
additional Taxes. Following the Initial Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not allow any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Company) to
agree to extend, waive, or toll any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment or collection of any Tax of the Acquired Company for any Pre-
Closing Period (or Straddle Period) (without the prior written consent of the
Sellers, which may consent shall not be withheld, conditioned or delayed).



9.10NOLs and Tax Attributes. Except to the extent required by Applicable Law,
the Purchaser shall not allow the Acquired Company to carry back any net
operating loss or other Tax attribute or credit into a Pre-Closing Period
without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In the event that any such net
operating loss or other tax attribute or credit is carried back into a Pre-
Closing Period, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to any
resulting Tax savings or Tax benefit actually realized by the Sellers. If the
Sellers make a payment to the Purchaser under the immediately preceding
sentence and the carried-back net operating loss, Tax attribute or credit is
subsequently adjusted by a Taxing Authority, and such adjustment causes the
Sellers' realized

 Tax savings or Tax benefit that originally formed the basis for the prior
payment to the Purchaser to be actually reduced, then the Purchaser shall pay
to the Sellers an amount equal to such reduction.



9.11Wage Reporting. The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that the
Purchaser is purchasing substantially all the property used in the Business,
and in connection therewith, the Purchaser may employ certain of the employees
who immediately before the Initial Closing Date were employed in such
Business. The parties agree that, pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2004-53, IRB 2004-34
page 320, each party, as applicable, shall comply with the requirements of the
standard procedure under Rev. Proc. 2004-53, pursuant to which EMC shall
furnish an IRS Form W-2 to each employee employed by EMC, disclosing all wages
and other compensation paid for the portion of this calendar year up to and
including the Initial Closing Date, and Taxes withheld therefrom, and the
Purchaser shall furnish an IRS Form W-2 to each employee employed by the
Purchaser who had been employed by EMC, disclosing all wages and other
compensation paid for the portion of this calendar year beginning on the day
after the Initial Closing Date through the earlier of the end of such calendar
year or such employee's date of termination, and Taxes withheld therefrom.



9.12Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser and the Acquired Company and their respective
designees will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Person is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that (i) amounts
are so deducted and withheld and timely paid over to the applicable Taxing
Authority, and (ii) an original, duplicate original or authenticated copy of
the receipt for foreign taxes paid, or other reasonably satisfactory evidence
of payment, is provided to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding were made (with a copy to EMC), such amounts will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made. To the extent the Purchaser
determines that it or the Acquired Company may need to deduct and withhold any
Tax under this Section 9.12, the Purchaser shall provide reasonable notice to
the Sellers and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or
eliminate such withholding.



9.13Canadian Tax Withholding. Based upon the Purchaser's understanding of
current applicable Law and administrative policies and its understanding of
the facts and circumstances known to it as of the date hereof, the Purchaser
does not intend to withhold Canadian withholding Tax from the amount paid by
it for the assignment of the EIC Business IP License to it.



ARTICLE 10

OTHER AGREEMENTS



10.1Further Assurances.

(a)Without limiting (and subject to) the other provisions of this Agreement,
prior to and following the Initial Closing, each party agrees to cooperate
fully with the other party and to execute such further instruments, documents
and agreements, and to give such further written assurances, as may be
reasonably requested by any other party to evidence, give effect to or
otherwise implement the Contemplated Transactions and to carry into effect the
intents and purposes of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. In
connection therewith, each party agrees to comply, and will cause its
applicable Affiliates

 to comply, with its respective commitments, obligations and covenants under
the other Transaction Agreements. Following the applicable Closing, the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall promptly execute and deliver to the other
party, as may be reasonably requested and without payment of any additional
consideration, any other assurances or additional documents or instruments
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Contemplated Transactions by,
and to carry out fully the purposes of, the Transaction Agreements. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers shall from time to time
when reasonably requested by the Purchaser, including after the applicable
Closing, and without further consideration, promptly take further action or
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the Purchaser
or its designee all such documents necessary or advisable to vest in the
Purchaser all right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Company and the
Acquired Assets, or to effect the Purchaser's assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities hereunder, in accordance with the Transaction Agreements.

(b)Without limiting the foregoing, with reference to the Transition Services
Agreement, each party agrees that, from the date hereof through the Initial
Closing, it will cooperate fully with the other party in identifying, and
agreeing in good faith upon, the Services (as defined in the Transition
Services Agreement) and the details thereof to be set forth on Schedule 1
thereto in respect of such Services as reasonably necessary for the transfer
of the Business to the Purchaser Group and the operation of the Business after
each applicable Closing; provided that, unless otherwise requested by the
Purchaser prior to the Initial Closing, Schedule 1 to the Transition Services
Agreement shall include all Services set forth in the version thereof appended
to the form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit G, in
each case as such Services are described therein. Without limiting the
foregoing or any of the covenants, agreements and obligations in Article 1, if
at any time during the twelve (12) month period commencing on the applicable
Closing Date, the Purchaser notifies the Sellers in writing of, or any Seller
otherwise becomes aware of, any transferable right, title or interest in any
Acquired Asset that has not been transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered
to the Purchaser Group (any such Acquired Asset, an "Omitted Acquired Asset"),
the Sellers shall take, and, as applicable, shall cause members of the Seller
Group to take, such actions as the Purchaser may reasonably request to
effectuate the transfer, conveyance, assignment or delivery of all
transferable right, title and interest to such Omitted Acquired Asset to the
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate. For the avoidance of doubt, any item
transferred to the Purchaser or its designated Affiliate pursuant to this
Section 10.1(b) shall constitute an Acquired Asset for all purposes hereunder.
If at any time during the twelve (12) month period commencing on the
applicable Closing Date, the Sellers notify the Purchaser in writing of, or
the Purchaser otherwise becomes aware of, any Excluded Asset was erroneously
transferred, conveyed, assigned or delivered to the Purchaser Group at a
Closing, then the parties shall cooperate to take such actions as either of
them may reasonably request in order to effectuate the transfer, conveyance,
assignment or delivery back to the applicable Seller or other member of the
Seller Group of all right, title and interest to such Excluded Asset
erroneously transferred to the Purchaser or its designated Affiliate.



10.2Wrong Pocket. Except as may otherwise be provided in the Transition
Services Agreement, in the event any Seller or any of its respective
Affiliates receives any payment related to any Acquired Asset or any mail,
courier package, facsimile transmission, purchase order, invoice, service
request or other document intended for or otherwise the property of the
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
after the Initial Closing, the Sellers agree to promptly remit (or cause to be
promptly remitted) such funds or documents to the Purchaser or its designated
Affiliate (after, in the case of funds and where applicable, the deduction of
any amount in respect of output VAT for which the relevant Seller (or the
relevant Affiliate thereof), or any member of any VAT group to which the
relevant Seller (or the relevant

 Affiliate thereof) belongs, is required to account). In the event that the
Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Acquired Company) receives any payment related to any Excluded
Asset or Excluded Liability or any mail, courier package, facsimile
transmission, purchase order, invoice, service request or other document
intended for or otherwise the property of the Sellers or one of their
Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement after the Initial Closing,
the Purchaser agrees to promptly remit (or cause to be promptly remitted) such
funds or documents to the applicable member of the Seller Group (after, in the
case of funds and where applicable, deduction of any amount in respect of
output VAT for which the Purchaser (or the relevant Affiliate thereof), or any
member of any VAT group to which the Purchaser (or the relevant Affiliate
thereof) belongs, is required to account).



10.3Records and Documents.

(a)Following the Initial Closing Date and for two (2) years thereafter (or,
except as otherwise expressly stated herein, six (6) years in the case of Tax-
related documents and information), the Sellers shall, and shall cause the
other members of the Seller Group to (i) grant to the Purchaser and its
Representatives, at the Purchaser's reasonable request, reasonable access
through and under the supervision of an Authorized Seller Representative
during normal business hours and under reasonable circumstances to, and, in
the case of records, documents, contracts and information, the right to make
copies at the Purchaser's sole expense of, those employees, records,
documents, contracts and information in the Sellers' employ or possession
related to the Business, the Acquired Company, the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities as may be reasonably necessary for the Purchaser's
operation of the Business after each applicable Closing (including any audit
of deferred revenue) or for litigation, preparation of financial statements,
Tax Returns, Tax Contests, employer immigration filings and other valid
business purposes and (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, maintain all
such records, documents, contracts and information in the same or a similar
accessible format as currently existing. Such records, documents, contracts
and information shall include correspondence (including e-mail
correspondence), warranty records, litigation files and all other records,
documents, contracts and information reasonably necessary in connection with
any litigation, preparation of financial statements, Tax Returns and Tax
Contests. If any Seller wishes to dispose of any of such records, documents,
contracts or information within two (2) years after the Initial Closing Date
(or six (6) years in the case of Tax-related documents and information), the
Sellers shall first give the Purchaser sixty (60) days' written notice, during
which period the Purchaser shall have the right to take such records,
documents, contracts and information without payment of consideration, and
only after the expiration of such sixty (60) day period may such Seller
dispose of such records, documents, contracts or information.

(b)Following the Initial Closing Date and for two (2) years thereafter (or six
(6) years in the case of Tax-related documents and information), the Purchaser
shall grant to the Sellers and their respective Representatives, at any
Seller's reasonable request, reasonable access through and under the
supervision of the Purchaser's personnel during normal business hours and
under reasonable circumstances to, and the right to make copies at the
Sellers' sole expense of, those records, documents and contracts covering any
period prior to each applicable Closing related to the Business, the Acquired
Company or the Acquired Assets as may be reasonably necessary for litigation,
preparation of financial statements, Tax Returns, Tax Contests and other valid
business purposes. If the Purchaser wishes to dispose of any of such records,
documents, contracts or information within two (2) years after the Initial
Closing Date (or six (6) years in the case of Tax-related documents and
information), the Purchaser shall first give the Sellers sixty (60) days'
written notice, during which period the Sellers shall have the right to take
such records, documents, contracts and

 information without payment of consideration, and only after the expiration of
such sixty (60) day period may the Purchaser dispose of such records,
documents, contracts or information.

(c)If so requested by either the Sellers or the Purchaser, the other party
shall enter into a customary joint defense agreement with the Sellers or the
Purchaser with respect to any information to be provided to such party
pursuant to this Section 10.3. All rights of access to information and
documents granted under this Section 10.3 are subject to restrictions on
access to classified facilities and information imposed by Governmental
Entities. Each party agrees that any investigation undertaken pursuant to the
access granted under this Section 10.3 shall be conducted in such a manner as
not to unreasonably interfere with the operation of the other party's
business. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
party nor any of its respective Affiliates shall be required to provide access
to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
attorney-client privilege or contravene any Laws or Orders or confidentiality
obligations of such party; provided that if reasonably practicable, the
Sellers will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, use Reasonable
Efforts to cooperate with the Purchaser in making alternative arrangements if
access and disclosure is declined pursuant to the foregoing.



10.4Indemnification. The Purchaser will not take any action to alter or impair
any exculpatory or indemnification provisions now existing in the charter or
bylaws (or comparable constituent document) of the Acquired Company for the
benefit of any individual who served as a director or officer of the Acquired
Company, at any time prior to the Initial Closing (each an "Affiliate
Indemnified Party"), except for any actions which may be required by
applicable Law or Order and any actions which do not affect the application of
such provisions to acts or omissions of such individuals prior to the Initial
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 8.6(a), the provisions of this Section 10.4 are
intended for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, each of the Affiliate
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs.



10.5Confidential Information. The parties agree as follows:

(a)The Sellers agree that following the Initial Closing Date they shall, and
shall cause their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors and
Affiliates to, keep the Business Confidential Information (as defined below),
confidential for a period of two (2) years from the Initial Closing Date (and,
with respect to any and all Trade Secrets, for so long as such Trade Secrets
are protectable under applicable Law), except that any Business Confidential
Information may be disclosed to the extent such disclosure is (i) required by
or requested pursuant to any applicable Law or Order (including those
promulgated by the SEC), or (ii) necessary to establish or exercise any rights
under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement. In the event that the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates or Representatives is required by any
applicable Law or Order to disclose any such Business Confidential
Information, the Sellers shall, (i) to the extent permissible by such
applicable Law or Order, provide the Purchaser with prompt written notice of
such requirement, (ii) disclose only that information that the Sellers
determine (with the advice of counsel) is required by such applicable Law or
Order to be disclosed and (iii) use Reasonable Efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of such Business Confidential Information, including by, at
the Purchaser's request and sole expense, reasonably cooperating with the
Purchaser to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Business
Confidential Information. For purposes hereof, the term "Business Confidential
Information" means all information to the extent it relates to the Business,
the Acquired Company, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, other
than any such

 information that (A) is available to the public on the Initial Closing Date,
or thereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of a
breach of this Section 10.5(a) or any other obligation of confidentiality; (B)
is developed after the Initial Closing Date by any member of the Seller Group
or any of their respective Affiliates independently and without reference to
or use of Business Confidential Information; or (C) is received by any member
of the Seller Group or any of their respective Affiliates after the Initial
Closing Date from a Third Party which third party is not known by any of the
Sellers to be bound by any obligation of confidentiality.

(b)Subject to the Outbound Intellectual Property License Agreement, the
Purchaser agrees that following the Initial Closing Date it shall, and shall
cause its directors, officers, employees, advisors and Affiliates (including
the Acquired Company) to, keep the Seller Confidential Information (as defined
below) confidential for a period of two (2) years from the Initial Closing
Date (and, with respect to any and all Trade Secrets, for so long as such
Trade Secrets are protectable under applicable Law), except that any Seller
Confidential Information may be disclosed to the extent such disclosure is (i)
required by or requested pursuant to any applicable Law or Order (including
those promulgated by the SEC) or (ii) necessary to establish or exercise any
rights under this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement. In the event
that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is required by
any applicable Law or Order to disclose any such Seller Confidential
Information, the Purchaser shall, (i) to the extent permissible by such
applicable Law or Order, provide the Sellers with prompt written notice of
such requirement, (ii) disclose only that information that the Purchaser
determines (with the advice of counsel) is required by such applicable Law or
Order to be disclosed and (iii) use Reasonable Efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of such Seller Confidential Information, including by, at the
Sellers' request and sole expense, reasonably cooperating with the Sellers to
obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such Seller Confidential Information.
For purposes hereof, the term "Seller Confidential Information" means all
information of any member of the Seller Group or any of their respective
Affiliates (excluding for such purposes and for the avoidance of any doubt,
the Acquired Company) that relates to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded
Liabilities and provided to the Purchaser in connection with the Contemplated
Transaction or otherwise in the possession of the Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Company) following the Initial Closing,
other than any such information that (A) is available to the public on the
Initial Closing Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public other than
as a result of a breach of this Section 10.5(b) or any other obligation of
confidentiality; (B) is developed after the Initial Closing Date by any member
of the Purchaser Group or any of their respective Affiliates independently and
without reference to or use of Seller Confidential Information; or (C) is
received by any member of the Purchaser Group or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Initial Closing Date from a Third Party which third party
is not known by the Purchaser to be bound by any obligation of
confidentiality.

(c)In no event will the Purchaser or the Acquired Company or any Affiliate or
agent of those Persons involved in the operation of the Business advertise or
hold itself out as a member of the Seller Group or any of their respective
Affiliates after the Initial Closing Date. In no event will any member of the
Seller Group or any of their respective Affiliates or any agent of those
Persons hold itself out as the Purchaser or any Affiliate of the Purchaser
after the Initial Closing Date.



 10.6Assignment of Contracts.

(a)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) this Agreement
does not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer, or effect an
assignment or transfer, of any Assumed Contract or any Assumed Real Property
Lease, or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, with respect to which the Sellers have not obtained a required
consent to assignment or transfer (or, in the case of any Shared Contract,
split and partial assignment or novation) as of the applicable Closing if an
attempted assignment or transfer (or, in the case of any Shared Contract,
split and partial assignment or novation) thereof without the consent of a
Third Party (including any Governmental Entity) would constitute a breach or
other contravention thereof or a violation of Law or Order (each such consent,
a "Required Consent"), (ii) such Assumed Contract, Assumed Real Property Lease
or claim, right or benefit shall not constitute an Acquired Asset, and any
Liability arising therefrom or related thereto shall not constitute an Assumed
Liability, in each case unless and until the applicable Required Consent shall
have been obtained and (iii) the parties agree to cooperate in good faith to
take such actions as are reasonably necessary to avoid any breach or violation
of any Assumed Contract or Assumed Real Property Lease as a result of any
failure to obtain any Required Consent, in each case, until the earlier of (A)
the expiration of the applicable Contract, (B) the date that is twelve (12)
months following the applicable Closing Date and (C) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms.

(b) (i) The Sellers agree to use, and to cause their Affiliates to use,
Reasonable Efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all
Required Consents relating to (w) any Material Customer Contract, (x) any
Material Vendor Contract (other than those set forth on Schedule 1.1(d)(ii) or
Schedule 1.1(d)(v)), (y) any Contract, other than the Material Vendor
Contracts identified on Schedule 1.1(d)(ii) or Schedule 1.1(d)(v), for Third
Party Embedded Software set forth on Schedule 3.8(b)(i) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and any other Contracts for Third Party Embedded Software
entered into after the date hereof in accordance with Section 5.1 (it being
understood that in the case of such Contracts for Third Party Embedded
Software, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates, to also use
Reasonable Efforts if necessary to assist the Purchaser or a member of the
Purchaser Group in obtaining its own licenses, on terms and conditions that
are substantially the same or better than those from which the Business
benefits as of the date hereof) or (z) any Assumed Real Property Lease (each
an "Efforts Contract" and, collectively, the "Efforts Contracts") and (ii) the
Purchaser agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to cooperate in connection with the
same, in each case, until the earlier of (A) the expiration of the applicable
Contract, (B) the date that is twelve (12) months following the applicable
Closing Date and (C) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

(c)Without limiting the foregoing, at a time to be mutually agreed between the
Purchaser and the Sellers, but in any event no later than forty-five (45) days
following the date hereof, the Sellers (or their Affiliates) shall send a
mutually agreed upon notice to each Customer (and any Person that becomes a
customer of the Business following the date hereof and prior to the applicable
Closing Date), each counterparty to any Assumed Contract (including any
Assumed Contract entered into following the date hereof and prior to the
applicable Closing Date) or any Assumed Real Property Lease, which notice
shall:

(i)inform such Person (A) of the contemplated sale of the Business to the
Purchaser, (B) of the assignment or transfer of the applicable Assumed
Contract or Assumed Real Property Lease (or, in the case of any Shared
Contract, the split and partial assignment or novation of such Contract) to
the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate effective as of the applicable
Closing and (C) that the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate will be
providing the

 relevant Business services or Transferred Products, as applicable, from and
after the applicable Closing;

(ii)in the case of a notice relating to an Efforts Contract, solicit such
Person to promptly and affirmatively deliver such Required Consent by
countersigning and returning to the Sellers a copy of such notice;

(iii)in the case of a notice relating to any Contract other than an Efforts
Contract, informing such Person that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the applicable Contract, such Required Consent will be deemed to have been
delivered by such Person unless such Person shall have affirmatively contested
the assignment or transfer of the applicable Contract or (or, in the case of
any Shared Contract, the split and partial assignment or novation of such
Contract) to the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate within thirty (30) days
following the date of such notice by sending written notice to the Sellers;
and

(iv)include such other information as the Purchaser may reasonably request.

With respect to each Shared Customer Contract, from and after the date of such
notice until such Shared Customer Contract shall have been split and assigned
in part or novated to the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate, the Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, prepare and deliver to the
Purchaser a separate invoice for the portion of amounts due under such Shared
Customer Contract that relates to the Business.

(d)The Sellers shall transfer and assign (or, in the case of a Shared
Contract, split and partially assign or novate) the Assumed Contracts and the
Assumed Real Property Leases (in each case, for which all Required Consents,
if any, shall have been obtained) to the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate
pursuant to the Transfer Documents at the Initial Closing or, if the
applicable Required Consents are obtained following the Initial Closing, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt thereof; provided,
that no Deferred Jurisdiction Contract shall be transferred or assigned until
the applicable Additional Closing. For purposes of this Section 10.6(d),
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, (i) with respect to any Required
Consent relating to any an Efforts Contract, such Required Consent shall be
deemed to have been obtained if the Person from whom such Required Consent is
required shall have affirmatively provided such consent by returning a
countersigned copy of the notice delivered to such Person pursuant to Section
10.6(c) and (ii) with respect to any Required Consent relating to a Contract
that is not an Efforts Contract, such Required Consent shall be deemed to have
been obtained if the Person from whom such Required Consent is required (A)
shall not have affirmatively contested the assignment or transfer (or, in the
case of a Shared Contract, split and partial assignment or novation) of the
applicable Contract to the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate prior to the
Initial Closing Date and (B) shall have continued to perform in all material
respects its obligations relating to the Business under the applicable
Contract during the period between the date of the notice delivered to such
Person pursuant to Section 10.6(c) and the Initial Closing Date, in any case
subject to the last sentence of Section 10.6(e).

(e)With respect to any Assumed Contract or Assumed Real Property Lease
(whether existing as of the date hereof or entered into prior to the Initial
Closing Date in accordance with Section 5.1) for which any Required Consent
shall not have been obtained (or deemed obtained pursuant to Section 10.6(d))
on or prior to the Initial Closing (each such Contract, a "Back-to-Back
Contract"), the Sellers and the Purchaser will, in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, implement,

 from and after the Initial Closing until the earlier of (x) the expiration of
such Back-to-Back Contract in accordance with its terms or (y) the date
following receipt of all applicable Required Consents upon which such Back-to-
Back Contract is transferred and assigned (or, in the case of a Shared
Contract, split and partially assigned or novated) to the Purchaser or its
applicable Affiliate in accordance with Section 10.6(d), a lawful and
reasonable arrangement, to the extent so permitted under applicable Law, to
provide the Purchaser Group all the obligations under (to the extent such
obligations would constitute Assumed Liabilities if all applicable Required
Consents were obtained) and benefits of (to the extent such benefits would
constitute Acquired Assets if all applicable Required Consents were obtained)
any such Back-to-Back Contract, including by subcontracting, licensing,
sublicensing, leasing or subleasing to the Purchaser Group of any or all of
the Seller Group's rights and obligations with respect to such Contract (to
the extent such rights and obligations would constitute Acquired Assets or
Assumed Liabilities, respectively, if all applicable Required Consents were
obtained); provided, that in the case of any Back-to-Back Contract that by its
terms prohibits the foregoing arrangement, the Sellers shall use Reasonable
Efforts to obtain the affirmative consent of the counterparty to such Back-to-
Back Contract to the foregoing arrangements, and the foregoing arrangement
shall apply to all such Back-to-Back Contracts in respect of which such
consent is obtained; and provided, further, that unless and until such
affirmative consent is obtained, the Sellers and the Purchaser will enter into
a reseller arrangement between the Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) and
the Sellers (or any Affiliate thereof) with respect to such Back-to-Back
Contract with substantially similar effect to the foregoing arrangements in
accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Existing Customer Reseller
Agreement. With respect to any Assumed Contract (whether existing as of the
date hereof or entered into prior to the Initial Closing Date in accordance
with Section 5.1) with a Customer that relates to Belgium, Brazil, Germany,
India, Italy or the Netherlands, in each case only if the applicable
jurisdiction is not included in the Initial Closing (each such Contract, a
"Deferred Jurisdiction Contract"), the Sellers and the Purchaser will, in
accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Existing Customer Reseller
Agreement, implement, from and after the Initial Closing until the earlier of
(x) the expiration of such Deferred Jurisdiction Contract in accordance with
its terms or (y) the applicable Closing for the jurisdiction to which such
Deferred Jurisdiction Contract relates, a lawful and reasonable reseller
arrangement, to the extent so permitted under applicable Law, to provide the
Purchaser Group all the obligations under (to the extent such obligations
would constitute Assumed Liabilities if the applicable Closing for the
jurisdiction to which such Deferred Jurisdiction Contract relates were to
occur) and benefits of (to the extent such benefits would constitute Acquired
Assets if the applicable Closing for the jurisdiction to which such Deferred
Jurisdiction Contract relates were to occur) any such Deferred Jurisdiction
Contract. In any such arrangement, (i) the Sellers will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, (A) not terminate, or waive, release or assign any such right
under any such Back-to-Back Contract or Deferred Jurisdiction Contract (or
settle or compromise any Claim related thereto) without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser (which may be withheld in the Purchaser's sole
discretion), (B) at the request of the Purchaser, use Reasonable Efforts to
enforce such rights under each such Back-to-Back Contract and Deferred
Jurisdiction Contract on behalf of the Purchaser or its designated Affiliate,
(C) at the request of the Purchaser, accept or reject purchase orders,
statements of work, change orders, proposed amendments and similar ancillary
agreements to any such Back-to-Back Contract or Deferred Jurisdiction
Contract, (D) at the request of the Purchaser, terminate any Back-to-Back
Contract or Deferred Jurisdiction Contract that is terminable in accordance
with its terms and (E) promptly notify the Purchaser of any request by a
counterparty to any Back-to-Back Contract or Deferred Jurisdiction Contract to
change the scope or details of the services provided thereunder and (ii) the
Purchaser or its designated Affiliate will, with respect to such obligations
and benefits under such Back-to-Back Contracts and Deferred Jurisdiction
Contracts (A) bear the sole responsibility for completion of the work or
provision of goods and services, (B) be solely entitled

 to all benefits thereof, economic or otherwise and (C) be solely responsible
for any warranty or breach thereof and any repurchase, indemnity and service
obligations thereof (in each case solely to the extent such obligations would
constitute Assumed Liabilities if all applicable Required Consents were
obtained and, in the case of any Deferred Jurisdiction Contract, the
applicable Closing for the jurisdiction to which such Deferred Jurisdiction
Contract relates were to occur). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if, following the Initial Closing and prior to the expiration of any
Assumed Contract (including any Assumed Contract entered into following the
date hereof and prior to the applicable Closing Date, but excluding any
Deferred Jurisdiction Contract) in respect of which a Required Consent was
deemed to have been obtained pursuant to Section 10.6(d), the applicable
Customer (or Person that becomes a customer of the Business following the date
hereof and prior to the Initial Closing) affirmatively contests the assignment
or transfer (or, in the case of a Shared Contract, split and partial
assignment or novation) to the Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate of such
Assumed Contract, such Contract shall be deemed a Back-to-Back Contract for
all purposes hereunder from and after the date on which the Purchaser notifies
the Sellers of such objection and the alternative arrangements described in
this Section 10.6(e) shall apply with respect thereto. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Purchaser's obligations and Liabilities incurred in performance of
the Back-to-Back Contracts and the Deferred Jurisdiction Contracts pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement or the Existing Customer Reseller Agreement,
as applicable, shall be no greater than the obligations and Liabilities the
Purchaser would have incurred pursuant to such Back-to-Back Contracts if all
Required Consents with respect to such Back-to-Back Contracts had been
obtained or pursuant to such Deferred Jurisdiction Contract if the applicable
Closing for the jurisdiction to which such Deferred Jurisdiction Contract
relates had occurred.

(f)With respect to any Back-to-Back Contract with a Customer for which any
Required Consent has not been obtained (or deemed obtained pursuant to Section
10.6(d)), the Purchaser shall, beginning no later than three (3) months prior
to the applicable renewal date of such Back-to-Back Contract, use Reasonable
Efforts to transition such Customer to a written agreement with the Purchaser
(or its applicable Affiliate), effective as of the applicable renewal date,
which agreement shall replace and terminate any portion of such Back-to-Back
Contract that obligates any member of the Seller Group to provide such
Customer any products or services of the Business. The Sellers shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use Reasonable Efforts to assist
the Purchaser with the same. In the event that any such Customer refuses to
enter into such an agreement with the Purchaser (or the applicable member of
the Purchaser Group) at the time of such Customer's applicable renewal date,
the Purchaser or the Sellers shall notify the other party, as applicable, of
such fact and, thereafter, EMC or the Purchaser may elect that the New
Business Reseller Agreement apply to the applicable renewed Contract to enable
EMC (or an Affiliate thereof) to service such Customer; provided, that (i) EMC
may so elect only if the applicable Customer was one of the top one hundred
(100) largest customers of Dell and its Affiliates by revenue during the then-
most recent full fiscal year and (ii) if so elected by EMC, the term during
which the New Business Reseller Agreement shall apply to such Contract shall
not exceed twelve (12) months.

(g)With respect to any Assumed Contract with a Customer entered into in
accordance with this Agreement by any member of the Seller Group following the
Initial Closing Date and prior to the Closing in the applicable jurisdiction,
the New Business Reseller Agreement shall apply to such Assumed Contract to
enable EMC (or an Affiliate thereof) to service such Customer.

(h)The Sellers and the Purchaser each agree that "Reasonable Efforts" for
purposes of this Section 10.6 includes (i) an obligation on the Sellers to use
reasonable efforts to provide any information about each Contract reasonably
requested by the Purchaser (including technical information and pricing

 information), (ii) assistance in negotiations with the counterparties and
(iii) an obligation on the Sellers to pay for any transfer fee or any other
one-time fee associated with obtaining the relevant Required Consent or the
assignment of the Sellers' Contracts for Selected Third Party Embedded
Software (unless the Purchaser or a member of the Purchaser Group already has
a license of sufficient scope for such Selected Third Party Embedded
Software).



10.7Transfer of Acquired Assets; Risk of Loss.

(a)The Sellers shall cause any Encumbrances on the Acquired Assets (other than
Permitted Encumbrances on Acquired Assets other than the Acquired Company
Shares) to be released, discharged and terminated in full prior to the
applicable Closing, and shall deliver to the Purchaser all of the Acquired
Assets free and clear of any such Encumbrances (other than Permitted
Encumbrances on Acquired Assets other than the Acquired Company Shares).

(b) (i) Prior to each applicable Closing Date, the Sellers will, at their cost
and expense, prepare for (A) relocation the Acquired Assets located at any
facilities currently occupied by any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates which facilities are not to be purchased, assigned, subleased,
transferred to or otherwise occupied by the Purchaser Group pursuant to this
Agreement, any Transaction Agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions (each such facility, an
"Excluded Seller Facility") and (B) all data transfers (including from the
Seller Group information databases, servers, or data infrastructure
facilities), delivery and transmission reasonably required in connection with
the transfer of the Acquired Assets and (ii) promptly following each
applicable Closing Date the Purchaser will (A) at its cost and expense, accept
transfer of and relocate such Acquired Assets from the relevant Excluded
Seller Facility and (B) be responsible for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Sellers in connection with the customization of
any data required to allow such data to be compatible with the Purchaser's
systems, as requested by the Purchaser. Subject to the provisions hereof, the
Sellers agree to cooperate, customize and agree to cause the other members of
the Seller Group to cooperate, with the Purchaser Group and provide the
Purchaser Group all assistance reasonably requested by the Purchaser in
connection with the planning and implementation of the removal and relocation
of any Acquired Assets or any portion of any of them to such location as the
Purchaser will designate. The Acquired Assets will be transported from the
Excluded Seller Facility by or on behalf of the Purchaser, and until all of
the Acquired Assets are removed from an Excluded Seller Facility, the Sellers
will each permit, and will cause their respective Affiliates to permit, the
Purchaser and its authorized Representatives, upon reasonable prior notice, to
have reasonable access to such Excluded Seller Facility during normal business
hours (or such other hours the parties deem reasonable or appropriate) to
accept transfer of the Acquired Assets.

(c)All risk of loss as to the Acquired Assets will be borne by, and will pass
to, the Purchaser Group as of the applicable Closing for each such Acquired
Asset, except in the case of tangible Acquired Assets and data transfers, for
which the risk of loss will be borne by, and will pass to the Purchaser Group
at the time of transfer of possession of such tangible Acquired Asset or
successful receipt by the Purchaser Group of such data. The Sellers will be
responsible for, at their sole cost and expense, (i) disconnecting and
detaching all fixtures and equipment that are Acquired Assets from the roof,
floor, ceiling and walls of an Excluded Seller Facility so as to be freely
removed from such Excluded Seller Facility by the Purchaser Group, (B)
packaging and crating the Acquired Assets for transporting to and reinstalling
the Acquired Assets

 at such location(s) as the Purchaser will determine, and (C) repairing any
damage that is caused by such removal.



10.8Certain Real Property Matters.

(a)At each applicable Closing, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller Group
for an amount equal to the total of any and all security deposit monies then
being held by the landlords under the Assumed Real Property Leases as set
forth in Schedule 10.8. With respect to the letters of credit or other similar
instruments held by the applicable landlord under an Assumed Real Property
Lease as set forth in Schedule 10.8 (each, a "Lease Security Instrument") as
security for performance of the tenant's obligations under such Assumed Real
Property Lease, the Purchaser shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause each and
every such Lease Security Instrument to be returned to the applicable member
of the Seller Group promptly following the applicable Closing Date and the
Sellers shall, and shall cause the other members of the Seller Group to,
cooperate with the Purchaser with respect thereto. The Purchaser agrees,
unconditionally and irrevocably, to reimburse and indemnify the Sellers and
their respective Affiliates for and against all payments, costs and expenses
incurred by such Persons as a result of facts and circumstances arising after
the applicable Closing and relating to any Lease Security Instrument that is
not replaced, released, terminated or returned on or prior to the applicable
Closing Date, in each case until the release of the Sellers' and their
respective Affiliates' obligations with respect thereto. The Sellers agree,
unconditionally and irrevocably, to reimburse and indemnify the Purchaser and
its Affiliates for and against all payments, costs and expenses incurred by
any such Person as a result of facts and circumstances arising prior to the
applicable Closing and relating to any Lease Security Instrument that has been
reimbursed to the Seller Group. All claims hereunder and any reimbursements
and indemnities required hereunder shall be made in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8.3, but shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.5.

(b)At the Purchaser's sole cost and expense, the Purchaser shall promptly and,
in any event, within six (6) months following the applicable Closing Date,
remove, or cause to be removed, from the Acquired Real Property any and all
identification signage, including signs, windows or door lettering, placards
or decorations identifying any member of the Seller Group or containing any
Intellectual Property of the Seller Group other than the rights of any of the
Sellers (if any) which were licensed to the Purchaser Group pursuant to the
Trademark License Agreement.

(c)The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, subject to the Sellers' obligation
under Section 5.15, that (i) as of the applicable Closing Date, the Seller
Group may cancel any and all of its insurance policies and coverages with
respect to the Acquired Real Property, and (ii) following the applicable
Closing Date, (A) the Purchaser assumes any and all Liabilities with respect
to maintaining insurance on the Acquired Real Property, and (B) the Seller
Group shall have no Liability whatsoever with respect thereto.



10.9Closing of Books. Each party agrees to consult in good faith and cooperate
with the other party and its Representatives, including by making its
employees and advisors available to the other party as reasonably requested,
in the closing of the Seller Group's books and records with respect to the
Business as of the Initial Closing Date in accordance with the Sellers'
regular closing schedule and procedures. Employees and advisors of each party
shall be made available pursuant to the preceding sentence only upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operation of the businesses of such party and
its Affiliates.



10.10Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a)Sellers covenant and agree to provide the Purchaser, as soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (but no later than fifteen (15) days
following the date hereof), with the information, on a non-anonymized basis,
required to be included in the list provided pursuant to Section 3.14(a) (also
including the title/position of such Employee of the Business). The Purchaser
covenants and agrees to, and, as applicable, shall cause members of the
Purchaser Group to, offer employment effective on the Initial Closing Date (or
the date of any Additional Closing, as applicable), in accordance with local
legal requirements, to all Employees of the Business and the employees of the
Seller Group and their respective Subsidiaries that are identified on Schedule
10.10(a), including any such employees who are absent due to vacation, family
leave, short-term disability or other approved leave of absence, but excluding
all such employees who are, as of the date hereof or on the applicable Closing
Date, on a performance improvement plan or receiving long term disability
benefits under any Seller Benefit Plan (such Employees of the Business who
accept such employment and commence employment on the applicable Closing Date,
the "Transferred Employees"); provided, however, that such Purchaser
obligation is subject to receiving the necessary correct and complete
information from the Sellers as described in this Section 10.10(a).

(b)During the period commencing on the Initial Closing Date and ending on the
date which is twelve (12) months from the Initial Closing (or if earlier, the
date of the Transferred Employee's termination of employment with the
Purchaser or an Affiliate of the Purchaser), the Purchaser shall, or shall
cause members of the Purchaser Group to, provide each Transferred Employee
with annual base salary or base wages, as applicable, annual cash target
incentive compensation opportunities (excluding (A) equity or equity-based
incentives, (B) any incentives or benefits (whether or not equity-based)
established in connection with the Dell Acquisition by a member of the Seller
Group or Dell (or any of their respective Affiliates), (C) the accelerated
payments and benefits listed in Schedule 5.1(b)(i)(B) (the "Accelerated
Incentive Awards") or the entitlement to receive any similar acceleration in
respect of any incentive compensation opportunities and (D) the Retention Plan
Obligations), severance compensation (including severance benefits) and
defined contribution retirement and health and welfare benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those received by such Transferred
Employee (unless otherwise required by applicable Law or in connection with a
transfer of undertakings or other transfer of employees under applicable Law,
in which case the Purchaser shall comply with such applicable Law),
immediately prior to the Initial Closing; provided, however, that the annual
base salary or base wages, as applicable, shall be not less than the annual
base salary or base wages, as applicable, as provided to such Transferred
Employee prior to the Initial Closing.

(c)For purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the
benefit and compensation plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of the
Purchaser or any applicable members of the Purchaser Group in which
Transferred Employees are eligible to participate following the applicable
Closing (the "Purchaser Plans"), the Purchaser and any applicable members of
the Purchaser Group shall credit each Transferred Employee with his or her
years of service with the Acquired Company, any member of the Seller Group and
their applicable Subsidiaries and any predecessor or other entities, to the
same extent as such Transferred Employee was entitled immediately prior to the
applicable Closing to credit for such service under any similar Seller Benefit
Plan; provided, however, that no such service shall be credited to the extent
that it would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, the Purchaser or any applicable

 member of the Purchaser Group will use Reasonable Efforts to cause (i) each
Transferred Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Purchaser Plans, (ii) for purposes of each
Purchaser Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to
any Transferred Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements of such Purchaser Plan to be waived for such Transferred
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable or waived under the comparable Seller Benefit Plans in which such
Transferred Employee participated immediately prior to the applicable Closing,
and (iii) for the plan year in which the applicable Closing occurs, the
crediting of each Transferred Employee with any co-payments, deductibles and
out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the time of the applicable Closing in
satisfying any applicable copayments, deductibles or out-of-pocket
requirements under any Purchaser Plan. In addition, the Purchaser or any
applicable member of the Purchaser Group will credit each Transferred Employee
the amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation, personal hours, paid-time-
off or days earned, and sick leave applicable to such Transferred Employee as
of or prior to the applicable Closing (collectively referred to herein as such
Transferred Employee's "Accrued PTO").

(d)The Purchaser and the Sellers intend that the Contemplated Transactions
should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of employment of
any employee who accepts an employment offer by the Purchaser that is
consistent with the requirements of Section 10.10(b), including for purposes
of any Seller Benefit Plan (other than those identified in Schedule 10.10(d))
that provides for separation, termination or severance benefits, and that each
such employee will have continuous employment immediately before and
immediately after the Initial Closing (or the date of any Additional Closing,
if applicable). The Purchaser shall assume, be responsible for, and shall
perform and discharge, or cause to be performed and discharged, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group and its Affiliates from and
against, (i) all Severance Liabilities that arise out of the termination of
employment by any member of the Purchaser Group or any of its Affiliates of
any Transferred Employee following the applicable Closing (for the avoidance
of doubt, after the date that is twelve (12) months following the Initial
Closing Date, such Severance Liabilities shall exclude any reference to any
Seller Benefit Plan or Seller policy), (ii) all Severance Liabilities that
arise due to the Purchaser's failure to comply with Section 10.10(b) and (iii)
all Severance Liabilities that arise out of the transfer of Accrued PTO in
lieu of payment thereof on or following the applicable Closing. The Sellers
shall assume, be responsible for, and shall perform and discharge, or cause to
be performed and discharged, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser Group and its Affiliates from and against, all Severance Liabilities
that arise out of the termination of employment by any member of the Seller
Group or the Acquired Company of any employees of the Business prior to the
applicable Closing. As used herein, "Severance Liabilities" (the "Severance
Liabilities") shall include all Liabilities arising under this Section
10.10(d), and, with respect to the termination of employment of any Employee
of the Business in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, all
statutory, contractual (to the extent made pursuant to a Seller Benefit Plan)
or other severance or other separation benefits, and any other payment
obligations or Liabilities arising out of or related directly to the
termination of employment of any such Employee of the Business in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions (including any payment of Accrued PTO and
compensation payable during a termination notice period, whether required by
applicable Law or by a Seller Benefit Plan or Seller policy existing as of the
date hereof, and any payments pursuant to a judgment of a court having
jurisdiction over the parties (but specifically excluding (A) any pension
benefits under the Seller Benefit Plans with respect to service prior to the
applicable Closing with any member of the Seller Group, for which the Sellers
shall be responsible in any event and (B) the Retention Plan Obligations). The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall each assume, be responsible for, and shall
perform and discharge, or cause to be performed

 and discharged, and shall indemnify and hold harmless each other and their
respective Affiliates from and against, fifty percent (50%) of all Severance
Liabilities, if any, that arise out of the termination of employment of an
Employee of the Business who received an offer compliant with Section 10.10(b)
that does not accept such offer.

(e)Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Transferred Employees any
right to continue in the employ or service of the Purchaser or any member of
the Purchaser Group (including any member of the Purchaser Group) or
constitute or create an employment agreement with, or modify the at-will
status of, any Transferred Employee. Nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Seller Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Purchaser or
prohibits the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any employee benefit plan.

(f)From the date of this Agreement until the Initial Closing, no less
frequently than every three (3) weeks, and on the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Initial Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver to the Purchaser
a correct and complete list setting forth, as of the date of delivery, the
information required to be included in the list provided pursuant to Section
3.14(a). Each such list shall clearly indicate incremental differences as
compared to the most recently delivered list (or, in the case of the first
such list, as compared to the list provided pursuant to Section 3.14(a)). No
information or knowledge obtained by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
10.10(f) shall (i) affect or be deemed to affect or modify any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, the conditions to the
obligations of the parties hereto to consummate the Closing in Article 6 or
otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of the Purchaser
hereunder or (ii) be deemed to affect or modify the Purchaser's reliance on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Sellers
in this Agreement.

(g)The Purchaser and the Sellers shall each assume, be responsible for, and
shall perform and discharge, or cause to be performed and discharged, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless each other and their respective Affiliates
from and against, fifty percent (50%) of all Damages resulting from Claims
arising under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988,
as amended, and any similar statute alleging that the transfer of employees
pursuant to the Contemplated Transactions constitute "employment losses".

(h)The parties shall coordinate and cooperate with each other in any
communications or interactions (i) with any applicable works council, labor
unions, trade unions, any other similar labor organizations or governmental
labor agencies, departments or officials prior to or following the Initial
Closing, (ii) between the date of this Agreement and the Final Closing, with
Employees of the Business regarding the Contemplated Transactions, including
any applicable relocation activities. The Sellers and the Purchaser shall use
their respective best efforts to, as promptly as possible following the date
hereof, (A) deliver to the applicable works councils in each jurisdiction
where a filing, notification or an information or consultation process is
reasonably expected to be required in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, including each jurisdiction set forth on Schedule 10.10(h), each
such filing and notification and all information and documentation required to
be so delivered in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, (B) take
such other action as may be necessary to initiate each such information or
consultation process and (C) take such action as may be necessary to complete
each such information or consultation process.

(i)The Sellers shall take all necessary steps such that prior to the Initial
Closing and at the Sellers' sole cost and expense, except as provided for in
Schedule 1.3(b), all outstanding equity, equity-

 based or other incentive awards held by any Transferred Employee, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Accelerated Incentive Awards and any other
retention awards or retention plan obligations that have been granted, issued,
promised or communicated to the Transferred Employees or that the Transferred
Employees are otherwise entitled to receive (together, the "Seller Incentive
Awards") will have vested and been cashed out in full, and such accelerated
vesting and payment will not result in any liability to any Transferred
Employee under Section 409A of the Code. Except as provided for in Schedule
1.3(b), neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall at any time have
any liability under or with respect to the Seller Incentive Awards.



10.11EMC Software Rights. The Purchaser hereby grants to EMC a worldwide,
perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, with
the right to sublicense through multiple tiers in connection with Sellers' or
their Affiliates' products, to use (including reproduce, create derivative
works of, distribute, display, and perform) libraries and other similar size
or type portions ("Libraries") of the Transferred Products, but solely to the
extent that such Libraries were used by EMC or its Affiliates' products or
services prior to the Initial Closing Date, and provided that such Libraries
were not incorporated with the intent of replicating the overall functionality
of the Transferred Products; provided that, with respect to any Libraries that
enable integration with the Transferred Products such as an SDK or non-
official SDK ("SDKs"), notwithstanding the above, the foregoing license shall
be limited to a period of twelve (12) months after the Initial Closing Date
and the above sublicense right shall be only for so long as such license is in
place. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 10.11 shall be
construed as a right to use or distribute any substantial portion of a
Transferred Product and (ii) the parties will, upon EMC's request, negotiate a
Contract in good faith under which EMC will receive a license to use such SDKs
following such twelve (12) month period.



ARTICLE 11

MISCELLANEOUS



11.1Governing Law; Forum.

(a)The Laws of State of Delaware (without reference to its principles of
conflicts of law) shall govern the construction, interpretation and other
matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and its exhibits
and schedules (whether arising in contract, tort, equity or otherwise).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that, except as specifically set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether
at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

(b)The parties mutually desire that friendly collaboration will develop
between them. Accordingly, they will try to resolve in a friendly manner all
disagreements and misunderstandings connected with their respective rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any agreement or document delivered
pursuant hereto or the Transaction Agreements, including any amendments hereof
and thereof. Except with respect to matters for which an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief is sought pursuant

 to Section 11.12, in the event that after the date hereof, to the extent that
any misunderstanding, dispute, controversy or claim (a "Dispute") arising out
of or relating to the Contemplated Transactions or the validity,
interpretation, breach or termination of any such agreement cannot be resolved
agreeably in a friendly manner either the Purchaser or the Sellers may by
written notice to the other party (the "Initial Notice") call for the
consideration of such dispute by a high level management employee (a "High
Level Management Employee"), to discuss and attempt to resolve the Dispute.
Such High Level Management Employee may be assisted by other advisors,
including accountants, attorneys and employees, in his or her discussions and
negotiations with the other party. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to
negotiate in good faith with one another for an additional period ending sixty
(60) days after the date of the Initial Notice. Any Dispute which the parties
cannot resolve through negotiation within such sixty (60) day period may then
be submitted to the courts for resolution pursuant to Section 11.1(c). Nothing
in this Section 11.1(b) will prevent either party from resorting to judicial
proceedings if (i) Reasonable Efforts to resolve the Dispute under these
procedures have been unsuccessful or (ii) interim relief from a court is
necessary to prevent serious and irreparable injury to one party or to others.
All offers of compromise or settlement among the parties or their
Representatives in connection with the attempted resolution of any Dispute
shall be deemed confidential settlement communications that have been
delivered in furtherance of a Dispute settlement and shall be exempt from
discovery and production and shall not be admissible in evidence (whether as
an admission or otherwise) in any proceeding for the resolution of the
Dispute.

(c)Except as set forth in Sections 9.6 and 9.7, the parties hereto irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware (or if such court does not have
subject matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the federal courts
of the United States of America located in the City of Wilmington in the State
of Delaware). Each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect
of such Dispute or proceeding will be heard and determined in such courts (and
the courts hearing appeals from such courts). The parties hereby irrevocably
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Dispute
brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum in connection
therewith. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW THEN IN EFFECT, EACH
PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER OR THE
PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES THEREUNDER OR THE ACTION OF ANY OF THE PARTIES THERETO
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

(d)EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HERETO
WAIVES ANY CLAIM FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES, COSTS OR PREJUDGMENT INTEREST FROM THE
OTHER.

(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Financing
Source Related Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
Contemplated Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in
any way to the Financing or the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance of
any of the foregoing, in any forum other than a court of competent
jurisdiction located within the City of New York, New York, in the Borough of
Manhattan, whether a state or Federal court.



11.2Binding Effect, Assignment and Beneficiaries.

(a)This Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their respective
successors and assignees, except that no party shall assign any of its rights
under this Agreement prior to the Initial Closing without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; provided that, without such consent, the
Purchaser may transfer or assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or
in part from time to time, to the Financing Sources and any other financing
sources for collateral security purposes, but no such transfer or assignment
of this Agreement or of any of its rights under this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 11.2(a) will relieve the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder.
In addition, no party may delegate any performance of its obligations under
this Agreement, except that the Purchaser may at any time assign, delegate or
transfer in whole or in part this Agreement or the performance of its
obligations to any Affiliate of the Purchaser so long as the Purchaser (i)
remains fully responsible for the performance of the delegated obligations by
executing such documents or instruments as the Sellers may reasonably request
and (ii) such Affiliate executes a written agreement of assumption of such
obligations in a form reasonably acceptable to the Sellers.

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Initial Closing, each Seller
may assign or delegate all or part of its rights or obligations, as
applicable, under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Sellers so long as such
Seller (i) remains fully responsible for the performance of the delegated
obligations by executing such documents or instruments as the Purchaser may
reasonably request and (ii) such assignee executes a written agreement of
assumption of such obligations in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser; in which event all the rights and powers of such Seller and the
remedies available to it under this Agreement shall extend to and be
enforceable by each such assignee. In the event of any such assignment and
delegation referred to above, the term "Seller" as used in this Agreement
shall be deemed to refer to each such assignee of such Seller where
appropriate, and shall be deemed to include both such Seller and each such
assignee where appropriate.

(c)Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than the rights of
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article 8 and Affiliate Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 10.4, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Financing Source shall be an express
third-party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce
Section 7.3(d), Section 11.1(a), the last sentence of Section 11.1(c),
Sections 11.1(d), 11.1(e), and 11.7, the last sentence of Section 11.12, and
this Section 11.2(d). In addition, each Seller agrees, on behalf of itself,
its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, managers, members,
stockholders, partners, employees, agents, Representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Related Parties"), that, without
limiting the Financing Sources' obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter,
the Financing Source Related Parties shall be subject to no liability or
claims (whether legal or equitable, arising under contract, tort or otherwise)
by such Seller or such Seller Related Parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, the Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Contemplated
Transactions or in connection with the Financing, or the performance of
services by such Financing Source Related Parties with respect to the
foregoing.



 11.3Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force, if the essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement for each party remain valid, binding and
enforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto will negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
Contemplated Transactions are consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.



11.4Entire Agreement; Conflicting Provisions. This Agreement, together with
the other Transaction Agreements and any side letters executed by the parties
in connection therewith, and all of the exhibits and schedules appended hereto
and thereto, constitute the final, complete and exclusive statement of the
parties' agreement on the matters contained herein and therein. All prior and
contemporaneous negotiations and agreements between the parties on the matters
contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements are
superseded by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including,
but subject to Section 5.5(b), the NDA.



11.5Counterparts. The parties may execute this Agreement in multiple
counterparts, each of which constitutes an original as against the party that
signed it, and all of which together constitute one agreement. This Agreement
is effective when one or more such counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other parties. The signatures of all parties
need not appear on the same counterpart. The delivery of signed counterparts
by facsimile or email transmission which includes a copy of the sending
party's signature(s) is as effective as signing and delivering the counterpart
in person.



11.6Expenses. Except to the extent specified otherwise in this Agreement, each
party will pay its own costs, professional fees and other expenses (including
all legal, accounting, broker, lender or investment banking) incurred by it in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions.



11.7Amendment. The parties may amend this Agreement only by a written
agreement signed by the parties and that identifies itself as an amendment to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
none of Sections 7.3(d), 11.1(a), 11.1(d), 11.1(e), and 11.2(d), this Section
11.7, the last sentence of Section 11.1(c), and the last sentence of Section
11.12 may be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that impacts
or is adverse in any respect to the Financing Source Related Parties without
the prior written consent of the Financing Source Related Parties.



11.8Waiver. The parties may waive a provision of this Agreement only by a
writing signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought.
A party is not prevented from enforcing any right, remedy or condition in the
party's favor because of any failure or delay in exercising any right or
remedy or in requiring satisfaction of any condition, except to the extent
that the party specifically waives the same in writing. A written waiver given
for one matter or occasion is effective only in that instance and only for the
purpose stated. A waiver once given is not to be construed as a waiver for any
other matter or occasion. Any enumeration of a party's rights and remedies in
this Agreement is not intended to be exclusive, and a party's rights and
remedies are intended to be cumulative to the extent permitted by Law and
include any rights and remedies authorized in Law or in equity.



11.9Notices. Each party giving any notice required or permitted under this
Agreement will give the notice in writing, and shall be deemed to have been
duly given: (a) when received if delivered personally; (b) when transmitted if
sent by facsimile (with transmission confirmed, which confirmation shall
promptly be delivered by the recipient if so requested by the sender in the
applicable notice); (c) the day after it is sent if sent by commercial
overnight courier; or (d) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail
(return receipt requested). Notice to a party is effective for purposes of
this Agreement only if given as provided in this Section 11.9 at the address
of which the sending party has been notified in accordance with this Section
11.9 (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice
given in accordance with this Section 11.9).

(e)The words "hereof, "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import

particular provision of this Agreement, and section and subsection references

or other item extends and shall not simply mean "if".



11.11No Joint Venture. Nothing in this Agreement creates a joint venture or
partnership between the parties. This Agreement does not authorize any party
(a) to bind or commit, or to act as an agent, employee or legal representative
of, another party, except as may be specifically set forth in other provisions
of this

 Agreement, or (b) to have the power to control the activities and operations
of another party. The parties are independent contractors with respect to each

will be cumulative (and not alternative). Subject to the following sentence,
the parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof or were
otherwise breached and that the parties shall be entitled (without the
requirement to post a bond or other security) to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches and threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The election of
the Sellers to pursue an injunction or specific performance shall not
restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Sellers from subsequently seeking to
terminate this Agreement and seeking to collect the Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 7.3(a); provided, however, that under no circumstances shall the
Sellers be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance resulting in the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and
the payment of the Termination Fee. In no event shall the Sellers be entitled
to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against the
Financing Sources.
