(b) The financial records, systems, controls, data and information of the
Company are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means that are
under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company or its
accountants. The Company has devised and maintained a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP (" _Internal
Controls_ "). Neither the Company nor an independent auditor of the Company
has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the system of Internal Controls utilized by the Company,

management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the Internal Controls utilized by the Company, or (iii) any
claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. There are no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Internal Controls over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect, in a material manner, the Company's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information, and there is no
fraud that involves the Company, Equityholder or any of their Affiliates, the
management of the Company or any other Person. The Company has made available
to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement, copies of each management
letter delivered to the Company by its accounting firm on or after January 1,

that would preclude the Company from initially qualifying as an S corporation
under Code Section 1361(a) or which would terminate the Company's S
corporation status (other than the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement). No Governmental Entity has challenged the effectiveness of any of
these elections. Each Subsidiary of the Company is treated as either a

purposes. No Alta Company has any "long-term contracts" that are subject to a
method of accounting provided for in Code Section 460 or has any deferred
income pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedure 2004-34, Treasury Regulation Section

otherwise the sale, transfer or disposition of any of their respective assets
or businesses or agree or otherwise commit to restrict the current or future
business of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

Section 6.3  _R andW Insurance Policy_.

  



  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent may acquire a binding agreement
(the " _Binder Agreement_ ") to be issued by Liberty Surplus Insurance
Corporation (the " _R andW Insurance Company_") at Closing of a Parent-side
representation and warranty insurance policy (the " _R andW Insurance Policy_")
naming Parent as the "named insured" and the Parent Indemnified Parties
(including, following the Closing, the Alta Companies) as additional insureds.
The RandW Insurance Policy will contain (i) an applicable deductible or
retention (the " _R andW Deductible_") amount no greater than an amount
equivalent to $3,300,000 (as of the Closing), (ii) policy coverage to include
inaccuracies in and breaches of the representations and warranties of
Equityholder and the Company, (iii) a limit of liability no less than
$44,000,000, (iv) no entitlement to subrogation rights of recovery against
any Shareholders, except in the case of fraud, and (v) such further terms as
set forth in the Binder Agreement. If Parent determines in its sole discretion
to acquire the RandW Insurance Policy, each Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in the Binder Agreement to ensure
that the RandW Insurance Policy is fully bound and in full force and effect at
the Closing.

  



  

(b) If the RandW Insurance Policy is acquired, from and after the Closing,
Parent shall notify Equityholder in connection with any claim made by any
Parent Indemnified Party under the RandW Insurance Policy and to the extent
requested in writing, Equityholder shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to
use good faith efforts to reasonably cooperate with the Parent Indemnified
Parties in connection with any claim made by such Person under the RandW
Insurance Policy. If the RandW Insurance Policy is acquired, without the prior
written consent of Equityholder, Parent shall not terminate or amend or waive
the RandW Insurance Policy (or any provision, right or remedy thereunder) in
any respect that would negatively impact Equityholder and at any time during
the period in which Parent or Merger Sub has a right to assert a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 6_.

  



  

Section 6.4  _Survival Periods_.

  



  

(a) None of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or
in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations and warranties, shall survive the Closing (and there shall be
no liability after the Closing in respect thereof). The covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement shall, in each case, survive until
their Applicable Limitation Dates.

  



  

(b) No Person shall be entitled to recover for any Loss pursuant to _Section
6.5(a)_ or _Section 6.5(b)_ unless written notice of a claim thereof is
delivered to Equityholder (in the case of a claim for which indemnification is
available pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_) or Parent (in the case of a claim
for which indemnification is available pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_), as the
case may be, prior to the Applicable Limitation Date.

  



  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Applicable Limitation Date_ " means,
(i) in respect of any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant of the
Company, Equityholder or Parent, as applicable, that by its terms contemplate
performance on or prior to the Closing shall survive for a period of twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, and (ii) in respect of any breach or non-
fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of the Company, Equityholder or
Parent, as applicable, that survives the Closing Date and which breach or
non-fulfillment occurs after the Closing, the date of the expiration, by their
terms, of the obligations of the applicable Party under such covenant or
agreement, including when such covenant or agreement has been fully performed
plus ninety (90) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity may be
sought under _Section 6.5_, and the indemnity with respect thereto, shall
survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ if notice of the misrepresentation, breach or non-fulfillment
thereof giving rise to such right or alleged right of indemnity shall have
been given to the Party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior
to such time.

Section 6.5 General Indemnification.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.5(c)_, _Section 6.5(d),_ and the other
limitations set forth herein, the Shareholders and the Equityholder shall
jointly and severally indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties and save and
hold each of them harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse
such Parent Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses which any such Parent
Indemnified Party may suffer as a result of, arising from or in connection
with:

  



  

(i) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant of the Company or the
Equityholder under this Agreement;

  



  

(ii) any inaccuracies in the Closing Settlement Statement; and

  



  

(iii) any breach of any representation or warranty in _Section 3.8(e)_.

  



  

(b) Parent shall indemnify the Equityholder Indemnified Parties and save and
hold each of them harmless from and against and pay on behalf of or reimburse
such Equityholder Indemnified Parties for any Losses which any such
Equityholder Indemnified Party may suffer as a result of, arising from or in
connection with any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant of Parent or the
Merger Sub under this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Neither the Shareholders nor Equityholder shall be liable to any Parent
Indemnified Party for any Loss pursuant to or arising under this Agreement to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all Losses indemnified by the
Shareholders or Equityholder exceeds the Merger Consideration received by the
Shareholders or Equityholder hereunder.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: Losses in
respect of which a Parent Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification shall be offset by any amounts or benefits received (whether
in the form of cash, credit or some other beneficial arrangement) from any
third party in respect of such Loss, including in respect of any insurance
proceeds, including pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy (net of any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining
such recovery, including any deductible under any insurance policy or the
retention under the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy) (collectively, the "
_Third-Party Recovery Proceeds_ ").

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

(e) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.5_
(an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_
") of the claim in writing after receiving written notice of any Proceeding
or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing the nature of the
claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof;
_provided_ , that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve an
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that an
Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. The Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve any disputed claim for indemnification. Any Indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Proceeding or other
claim giving rise to an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such
Indemnitor's expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations set forth
below) shall be entitled to assume the control of the defense thereof by
providing notice to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
notice described in the first sentence of this  _Section 6.5(e)_ and in
connection therewith, by irrevocably acknowledging, admitting and agreeing to
fully indemnify the Indemnitee for all Losses relating to such claim for
indemnification, subject to the terms of this _Section 6.5_. If the
Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim for indemnification, it shall
appoint counsel that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee (which the
Parties hereby agree that Winston and Strawn LLP is reasonably acceptable
counsel to Equityholder) to be the lead counsel in connection with such
defense; _provided_ , that (i) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice
for such purpose if the fees and expenses of such separate counsel are borne
entirely by the Indemnitee; (ii) Equityholder shall not be entitled to assume
control of such defense if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal Proceeding, (B) the claim primarily
seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against a Parent Indemnified
Party, (C) presents, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue between the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor,
(D) involves any customer or supplier of the Indemnitee or any of their
Affiliates and such claim could reasonably be expected to materially impair
such Indemnitee's or its Affiliate's relationship with such customer or
supplier, (E) in the circumstances in which Equityholder are the Indemnitor,
has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in Losses that exceed the maximum
amount of liability Equityholder would have under this _Section 6.5_; and
(iii) if an Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, such
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering
into any settlement of a claim; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to the
limitations set forth in this _Section 6.5_, an Indemnitor may settle or
consent to the entry of judgment in respect of such claim without the consent
of the Indemnitee, if such settlement or judgment is for (x) money damages
only, (y) includes a full and unconditional release of the Indemnitee from any
further liability in respect of such claim and (z) does not contain any
admission of wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnitee. The Indemnitee
may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend any third party claim
prior to the time it receives notice from the Indemnitor that it will assume
the defense of such claim. If the Indemnitor makes any payments on any claim
pursuant to this _Section 6.5_, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnitee to any
insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnitee with respect to such
claim, including any claims against third parties.

  



  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, except in the case of fraud or pursuant to
_Section 6.5(a)(iii)_ , the Parent Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive
source of recovery for any Losses due to a breach or misrepresentation of any
representations of Equityholder, Shareholders, or the Company, in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered by Equityholder, Shareholders, or
the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be recovery from the insurance
coverage provided by the RandW Insurance Policy (if acquired by Parent), and,
except pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)(iii)_ , in no event (including if the RandW
Insurance Policy is not acquired) will any Parent Indemnified Party make a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, including _Section
6.5_, in respect of any Loss resulting from any breach of any representation
or warranty of Equityholder, Shareholders, or the Company pursuant to this
Agreement or any certificate delivered by Equityholder, Shareholders, or the
Company pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 6.5_, to the extent Equityholder or Shareholders are liable
to any Parent Indemnified Party for any indemnifiable Loss pursuant to
_Section 6.5(a)_, then Equityholder or Shareholders shall be required to
effect and discharge payment of such indemnifiable Loss within three (3)
Business Days after the final, binding determination thereof, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Parent Indemnified Party, the
amount of such indemnifiable Loss.

  



  

(g) To the extent Parent is liable to any Equityholder Indemnified Party for
any indemnifiable Loss pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_ , then Parent shall be
required to effect and discharge payment of such indemnifiable Loss within
three (3) Business Days after the final, binding determination thereof, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Equityholder Indemnified
Party, the amount of such indemnifiable Loss.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(h) To the extent that any Third-Party Recovery Proceeds are recovered by a
Parent Indemnified Party after the related indemnification payment has been
made by Equityholder or Shareholders pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ for the
same Loss, in order to prevent any recovery of a Loss more than once in
respect of the same Losses suffered, such Parent Indemnified Party shall
pay over to Equityholder or Shareholders, in cash, the amounts of such Third-
Party Recovery Proceeds for which indemnification payments have previously
been made by Equityholder or Shareholders, promptly after such Third-Party
Recovery Proceeds are actually recovered, but not more than the amount of
indemnification payment made by Equityholder or Shareholders pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
purposes of this _Section 6.5_, each representation and warranty in this
Agreement and the Schedules shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the terms "material", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse
Effects" or similar phrases or qualifiers contained in such representation or
warranty (as if such words or phrases were deleted from such representation
and warranty).

  



  

(j) The representations and warranties of Equityholder and the Company, and
any Parent Indemnified Party right to indemnification with respect thereto,
shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by
or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified Party or by reason of the fact that
any Parent Indemnified Party knew, or should have known, that any such
representation and warranty was, or might be, inaccurate.

  



  

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Equityholder
hereby agrees that no Equityholder Indemnified Party will be entitled to seek
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution from Parent or any Alta Company or
any of their respective officers or directors for any indemnity or other
obligation for which Equityholder is liable to any Parent Indemnified Party
under this Agreement.

  



  

(l) All indemnification payments under this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Merger Consideration for all purposes, including for
income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(m) Except for the RandW Insurance Policy, and subject to _Article VII_ , and
except in the event of fraud, the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ and
_Section 8.10_ hereof set forth the exclusive rights and remedies of the
Parties to seek or obtain monetary damages from any Party with respect to
matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, and
any certificates, instruments, or agreements executed or delivered in
connection herewith or therewith (except as otherwise and to such extent as
specifically set forth in such certificate, document, or instrument).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.5(n)_ shall not operate to (i)
interfere with, impede, or limit the rights or obligations of the Parties
under _Article VII_ , or (ii) limit the rights of the Parties to seek
equitable remedies (including specific performance or injunctive relief in
accordance with _Section 8.10_ ).

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

Section 6.6  _Certain Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Equityholder shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns for each Alta Company which are due on or prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the " _Equityholder Prepared Returns_ "), and
shall pay any Taxes shown as due on any Equityholder Prepared Return to the
applicable Taxing Authority. Equityholder shall cause each Equityholder
Prepared Return to be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company's past
practice. Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
at Parent's sole cost and expense, all Tax Returns of the Alta Companies that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date (the " _Parent Prepared
Returns_ "), and shall pay any Taxes shown as due on any Parent Prepared
Return that is not a Pass-Through Tax Return. To the extent that an
Equityholder Prepared Return or a Parent Prepared Return is a Pass-Through Tax
Return, such Tax Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with existing
procedures and practices and accounting methods, unless otherwise required by
Law; provided that any such Tax Return shall only be permitted to include any
"bonus depreciation" under Code Section 168(k) in such a manner as to
minimize the Tax liability of the members of the Alta Company as a result of
the taxable income of the Alta Company; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
Alta Company that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes shall use the interim closing of the books method for purposes of
allocating income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for a taxable period that
includes, but does not end on, the Closing Date. Each Parent Prepared Return
that is a Pass-Through Tax Return shall be submitted to Equityholder for
Equityholder's review and comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due
date of the Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions). Parent
shall in good faith consider all reasonable comments received from
Equityholder no later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for filing any
such Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this _Section 6.6(a)_, Equityholder, at its sole cost
and expense, shall be solely responsible for filing any and all of the Tax
Returns required to be filed by Equityholder and paying all of the Taxes due
and owing by Equityholder (including to the extent attributable to income of
any Alta Company that flows up to Equityholder). The parties hereto shall
file all Tax Returns consistently with the Intended Tax Treatment unless
otherwise required by a determination of a Taxing Authority that is final.

  



  

(b) Parent shall notify Equityholder of receipt by any Alta Company of a
written notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment, litigation
or other Proceeding if such audit, assessment, litigation or other Proceeding
is with respect to Taxes with respect to any Pass-Through Tax Returns of any
Alta Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (" _Tax Contest_ "). No
failure or delay of Parent in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce
or otherwise affect the obligations or Liabilities of Equityholder pursuant
to this Agreement except to the extent Equityholder is materially prejudiced
thereby. Parent shall control, or cause the applicable Alta Company to
control, the conduct of any Tax Contest, _provided_ , that (i) Equityholder
shall have the right to participate in such Tax Contest and (ii) Parent shall
not settle, resolve or abandon the Tax Contest (or any portion thereof)
without the prior written consent of Equityholder (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything in
the Agreement to the contrary, in case of any conflict between this _Section
6.6(b)_ and  _Section 6.5(e)_ with respect to any Tax Contest, this _Section
6.6(b)_ shall govern with respect to such Tax Contest.

  



  

(c) Each Party shall cooperate (and cause its Affiliates to cooperate) fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by each other Party, in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 6.6(a)_
and any audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any
Alta Company (whether or not a Tax Contest). Such cooperation shall
include the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit or other Proceeding and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Following the Closing, Parent
agrees to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Alta Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by Equityholder, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority. Each Party shall furnish the other
Parties with copies of all relevant correspondence received from any Taxing
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any Taxes for which the other may have an indemnification obligation under
this Agreement. Each Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
provide certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are
necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any
Transfer Tax. Equityholder shall (and shall cause his Affiliates to) provide
any information reasonably requested, at Parent's sole cost and expense, to
allow Parent or any Alta Company to comply with any information reporting or
withholding requirements contained in the Code or other applicable Laws or to
compute the amount of payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to
any payment made in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

   

54

 



    



  

(d) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, goods and services,
stamp, registration, notarial fees and other similar Taxes and fees
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be paid by the Surviving Company.
Each Alta Company will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable
Law, Equityholder and Parent will, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate and join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

  



  

(e) If any imputed underpayment (within the meaning of Code Section 6225) is
assessed against Alta Enterprises, LLC with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, the Company and the Equityholder shall each timely file amended Tax
Returns pursuant to Code Section 6225(c)(2) and the regulations promulgated
thereunder taking into account, to the fullest extent possible, any such
imputed underpayment, and shall include payment of any tax due with such
amended Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, such obligation shall be
subject to the provisions of _Section 8.10_ providing for specific
performance in the event such obligation is breached.

  



  

Section 6.7  _Press Release; SEC Filings_.

  



  

(a) Any press or other public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be issued without the consent of
each of Parent and Equityholder, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each Party
may make any such announcement which it in good faith believes is necessary or
advisable in connection with any required Law.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable and in any event with four (4) Business Days
of execution of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act to report the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Signing Form 8-K_ "), and the Parties
shall issue a mutually agreeable press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement (the " _Signing Press Release_ ").

  



  

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof and the
availability of the Financial Statements of the Alta Companies, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC a preliminary
Proxy Statement, which shall comply as to form, in all material respects,
with, as applicable, the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, for the purpose of soliciting
proxies from Parent Stockholders to vote at the Parent Stockholder Meeting in
favor of the Parent Stockholder Voting Matters. Parent shall file the
definitive Proxy Statement with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders of record, as of the record date to be established
by the Parent Board.

  



  

(d) Prior to filing with the SEC, Parent will make available to Equityholder
drafts of the Proxy Statement and any other documents to be filed with the
SEC, both preliminary and final, and drafts of any amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or such other document and will provide Equityholder with
a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts and shall consider such
comments in good faith. Parent will advise Equityholder promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of (i) the time when the Proxy Statement has been
filed, (ii) in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement is not reviewed by
the SEC, the expiration of the waiting period in Rule 14a-6(a) under the
Securities Exchange Act, (iii) in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement is
reviewed by the SEC, receipt of oral or written notification of the
completion of the review by the SEC, (iv) the filing of any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement, (v) any request by the SEC for amendment of
the Proxy Statement, (vi) any comments, written or oral, from the SEC
relating to the Proxy Statement and responses thereto and (vii) requests by
the SEC for additional information in connection with the Proxy Statement.
Parent and Equityholder shall cooperate to promptly respond to any comments of
the SEC on the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC under the
Securities Exchange Act as soon after filing as practicable.

  



  

   

55

 



    



  

(e) If at any time prior to Parent Stockholders Meeting the Parties discover
or become aware of any information that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly transmit to
its stockholders an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement containing
such information.

  



  

(f) The Parties acknowledge that a substantial portion of the Proxy Statement
and certain other forms, reports and other filings required to be made by
Parent under the Securities Exchange Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Additional Parent Filings_
") shall include disclosure regarding the Company and its business and the
Company's management, operations and financial condition. Accordingly,
Equityholder agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, provide Parent with all information concerning
Equityholder and the Company, their business, management, operations and
financial condition, in each case, that is reasonably required to be included
in the Proxy Statement, Additional Parent Filings or any other Parent SEC
Filing. The Alta Companies shall make available to Parent and its counsel, and
shall cause their Affiliates, directors, officers, managers and employees to
make available to Parent and its counsel, all information
reasonably available and requested by Parent or its counsel in connection
with the drafting of the Proxy Statement and Additional Parent Filings and
responding in a timely manner to comments thereto from the SEC. If, at any
time prior to the Closing, the Parties discover or become aware of any event,
fact or circumstance relating to Equityholder, the Company or the business, or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, managers or
employees or their respective management, operations or financial
condition, which would be required to be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such documents would not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or failure to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they are made, not misleading, such Person shall promptly inform the
other Parties, and the Parties shall cooperate reasonably in connection with
preparing and disseminating any such required amendment or supplement. Parent
shall make all necessary filings with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act and
applicable blue sky Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Parent,
acting through the Parent Board, shall include in the Proxy Statement the
recommendation of the Parent Board that the Parent Stockholders vote in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Parent Stockholder
Voting Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board may withdraw
or modify such recommendation (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") if the
Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and financial advisors, that failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
_,_ that the Parent Board shall not be entitled to exercise its rights to
make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 6.7(f)_ unless (i)
such Change in Recommendation is based upon an Intervening Event and (ii)
Parent has provided to the Company three (3) Business Days' prior written
notice advising the Company that the Parent Board intends to take such action
and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail. Parent agrees that,
unless the Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, its
obligation to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the special meeting for the purpose of voting on the Parent
Stockholder Voting Matters shall not be affected by any Change in
Recommendation, and Parent agrees to establish a record date for, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholder Meeting and submit for
the approval of its stockholders the matters contemplated by the Proxy
Statement, regardless of whether or not there shall be any Change in
Recommendation.

draft Current Report on Form 8-K in connection with and announcing the
Closing, together with, or incorporating by reference, such information that
is or may be required to be disclosed with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Form 8-K (the " _Closing Form 8-K_
"). Parent shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Closing 8-K prior to its filing and shall consider such
comments in good faith. Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall prepare a
mutually agreeable press release announcing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Closing Press Release_ ").
Concurrently with the Closing, Parent shall distribute the Closing Press
Release, and within four (4) Business Days thereafter, file the Closing Form
8-K with the SEC.

  



  

(h) The Company shall provide to Parent as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement (i) all audited and unaudited financial statements of
the Alta Companies required under the applicable rules and regulations and
guidance of the SEC to be included in the Proxy Statement and/or the Closing
Form 8-K, (ii) all selected financial data of the Alta Companies required by
Item 301 of Regulation S-K, as necessary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
and Closing Form 8-K and (iii) management's discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations prepared in accordance with Item
303 of Regulation S-K of the SEC (as if the Alta Companies were subject
thereto) with respect to such periods as required by the applicable rules and
regulations and guidance of the SEC, as necessary for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement and Closing Form 8-K.

severally, that the information (i) relating to the Equityholder or the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, managers
or employees or their respective management, operations or financial
condition, or (ii) provided by any Alta Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives, in any case, to be contained in the Proxy
Statement, the Additional Parent Filings, any other Parent SEC Filing, any
document submitted to any other Governmental Entity or any announcement or
public statement regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Signing Press Release and the Closing Press Release) shall not

fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading at (w) the time such information is

(or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the
stockholders of Parent, (y) the time of the Parent Stockholder Meeting or (z)

Agreement, each Party shall be liable for and pay all of its own costs and
expenses (including attorneys', accountants' and investment bankers' fees and
other out-of-pocket expenses) in connection with the negotiation and

representative, or in any other capacity of any Alta Company related to any
facts, conditions, transactions, events, or circumstances occurring or
existing prior to the Closing.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.10_, nothing
in this _Section 6.10_ shall limit, modify, restrict, operate as a waiver

Section 6.11  _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) Parent acknowledges that (i) each Person that prior to the Closing served
as a director, officer, manager, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of any

in effect for a period of six (6) years thereafter, "run-off" coverage as
provided by any Alta Company's fiduciary and employee benefit policies, in

consent of Equityholder.

Section 6.12  _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing,
Parent and its Affiliates shall make or cause to be made available to
Equityholder (at Equityholder's sole expense) all books, records, Tax Returns
and documents of any Alta Company during regular business hours as may be
reasonably necessary for (a) investigating, settling, preparing for the
defense or prosecution of, defending or prosecuting any Proceeding (other
than an actual or potential Proceeding or dispute (i) brought or
threatened to be brought by Equityholder or his Affiliates or (ii) brought or
threatened to be brought by Parent or its Affiliates against Equityholder or

reports to Governmental Entities or (c) such other purposes (that do not

Equityholder under or arising out of this Agreement) for which access to such
documents is determined by such Equityholder to be reasonably necessary,
preparing Tax Returns, pursuing Tax refunds or responding to or disputing any
Tax audit. Parent shall (at its sole expense) cause each Alta Company to
maintain and preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records and other
documents for six (6) years after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to provide any access or
information to Equityholder, his Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives which Parent reasonably believes it or, after the Closing,
any Alta Company is prohibited from providing to Equityholder, his Affiliates
or their respective representatives by reason of applicable Law, which, for
the avoidance of doubt, (A) constitutes or allows access to information
protected by attorney-client privilege, or which Parent or any Alta Company
are required to keep confidential or (B) could prevent access by reason of a
Contract with a third party or which would otherwise expose Parent, any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Alta Company) to a material
risk of Liability.

  



  

Section 6.13  _No Other Representations; Non-Reliance of Parent_. Parent
acknowledges and agrees that in making its decision to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent has
relied solely upon the express representations and warranties of Equityholder
set forth in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of this Agreement (including
the related portions of the Disclosure Schedules).

  



  

Section 6.14  _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement (except in the case of the immediately
succeeding sentence) or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that any Party may
be a partnership or limited liability company, but except in the case of
fraud, each Party hereto, by its acceptance of the benefits of this
Agreement, covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Persons other than the
Parties shall have any obligation hereunder and that it has no rights of
recovery hereunder against, and no recourse hereunder or under any documents,
agreements, or instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
or therewith shall be had against, any former, current or future director,
officer, agent, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling
Person, fiduciary, representative or employee of any Party (or any of their
successors or permitted assignees), against any former, current, or future
general or limited partner, manager, stockholder or member of any Party (or
any of their successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate thereof or
against any former, current or future director, officer, agent, employee,
Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,
representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of
any of the foregoing, but in each case not including the Parties (each, but
excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties, a " _Non-Party Affiliate_
"), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or
through a claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of
such party against the Non-Party Affiliates, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any Proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other applicable Law, or otherwise; it being expressly agreed and acknowledged
that no personal Liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or
otherwise be incurred by any Non-Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations
of the applicable party under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, under any documents or instruments delivered
contemporaneously herewith, in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or for any
claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
a Non-Party Affiliate may have obligations under any documents, agreements, or
instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith or otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement if such Non-Party Affiliate is party to such document,
agreement or instrument. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth
in, and subject in all cases to the terms and conditions of and
limitations herein, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action of any kind based upon, arising out of, or related
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named
as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such Party. Each Non-Party Affiliate is
expressly intended as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.14_.

Section 6.15  _Financing._

  



  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent may execute Subscription Agreements
with Equity Investors and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
enforce the terms of any Subscription Agreements.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Pre-
Closing Period, Parent shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Debt Agreements_ ")
consistent with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter, (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of)
on a timely basis all conditions in the Subscription Agreements, Debt
Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and such Definitive Debt Agreements that are
within its control (including payment of all fees and expenses) and comply
with its obligations thereunder, (iii) maintain in effect the
Subscription Agreements, Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance
with their terms and (iv) diligently enforce all of its rights under the
Subscription Agreements and Debt Commitment Letter (and any definitive
agreements related thereto), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall not
be required to commence or pursue litigation, and Equityholder shall have no
right to compel Parent to commence or pursue litigation, to enforce the
obligations of the Financing Sources or the Debt Financing Sources to fund
the Financing. Parent shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to take or
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that could reasonably
be expected to result in a default under or failure of any of the conditions
contained in, or materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the
Financing contemplated by the, Subscription Agreement and the Debt
Commitment Letter or in any Definitive Debt Agreement related to the Debt
Financing.

  

  



  

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, Parent shall use, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to comply with its
obligations, and enforce its rights, under the Commitment Letters. Parent
shall give Equityholder prompt notice of any material breach by any party to
the Commitment Letters of which Parent has become aware or any termination (or
alleged or purported termination) of the Commitment Letters. Parent shall
keep Equityholder informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing and shall
not permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letters entered into at or prior to
the date hereof if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (i) would
materially delay the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Financing, (iii) adds or imposes new conditions or
amends the existing conditions to the drawdown of the Financing or (iv) is
adverse to the interests of Equityholder, in each case, in any material
respect.

    

  



   

60

 



    

  



  

(d) In the event that any portion of the Committed Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex provisions")
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, regardless of
the reason therefor, and such portion of the Committed Financing is required
to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date,
Parent will (i) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative financing
(the " _Alternative Financing_ ") (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with any then-available Financing pursuant to any then-existing Debt
Commitment Letter and available cash of Parent, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses earned,
due and payable as of the Closing Date) on terms not less favorable in the
aggregate to Parent than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and
the Fee Letter that the Alternative Financing would replace (taking into
account any flex provisions) from the same or other sources and which do not
include any incremental conditionality to the consummation of such
Alternative Financing that are more onerous to Parent, Equityholder and the
Alta Companies (in each case, in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter (as applicable) in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) immediately notify Equityholder of such unavailability and
the reason therefor. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, under no circumstances shall Parent or its Affiliates be obligated
to provide Financing.

  



  

(e) For purposes of the foregoing _Section 6.15(a)_ through _Section
6.15(c)_, (i) the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to
any Alternative Financing (that is debt financing) arranged in compliance
herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in
question), (ii) the term " _Fee Letter_ " shall be deemed to include any fee
letter (or similar agreement) and engagement letter (or similar agreement)
with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance with this
_Section 6.15(d)_, (iii) the term " _Debt Financing Sources_ " shall be
deemed to include any Debt Financing Sources providing the Alternative
Financing (that is debt financing) arranged in compliance herewith, (iv) the
term " _Subscription Agreement_ " shall be deemed to include any subscription
agreement with respect to any Alternative Financing (that is equity
financing) arranged in compliance herewith (and any Subscription Agreements
remaining in effect at the time in question) and (v) the term " _Equity
Financing Sources_ " shall be deemed to include any Equity Financing Sources
providing any portion of the Alternative Financing that is equity
financing arranged in compliance herewith. Parent shall keep Equityholder
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Financing. Parent shall provide Equityholder with
prompt written notice of any material breach, threatened material breach or
material default by any party to any Subscription Agreement, Debt Commitment
Letter or the Definitive Debt Agreements of which Parent gains knowledge and
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Equity Financing Sources or Debt Financing Sources with respect to any
material breach, threatened material breach or material default or,
termination or repudiation by any party to any Subscription Agreement, Debt
Commitment Letter or the Definitive Debt Agreements or any provision thereof.

  



    

61

 



    



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Section 6.15_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
require, and in no event shall the "commercially reasonable efforts" of Parent
be deemed to construe or require, Parent to (i) bring any enforcement action
against any Equity Financing Sources or Debt Financing Source to enforce its
rights under the applicable Financing, (ii) seek or accept Financing on terms
adverse to or less favorable than those set forth in the Subscription
Agreements or Debt Commitment Letters, as applicable, (iii) pay any fees in
excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or any Fee
Letter delivered in connection therewith) (whether to secure waiver of any
conditions contained therein or otherwise) or (iv) agree to waive any term or
condition of this Agreement or amend or waive any term of the, Subscription
Agreements or Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(g) Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1_, Equityholder and each Alta Company agree, and
shall cause the appropriate officers and employees thereof, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing (including the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth therein) as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
including by (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with
rating agencies at mutually agreeable times and locations and upon reasonable
advance notice, (ii) assisting with the preparation of customary materials for
actual and potential Equity Investors, rating agency presentations, offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with the Financing
(which shall not include pro forma financial information), (iii)
executing and delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive
financing documents, or other certificates, or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral, _provided_ , that such documents will not take effect until the
Closing, (iv) assisting Parent to comply with any applicable provisions of the
Debt Commitment Letters, (v) providing the Financial Statements and such
other financial information regarding the Alta Companies that is
readily available or within the Alta Companies' possession and as is
reasonably requested in connection with the Financing, (vi) at each Alta
Company's option, taking or appointing a representative of Parent to take all
corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably
requested by Parent to permit the consummation of the Financing and, in the
case of the Debt Financing, the direct borrowing or incurrence of all of the
proceeds of the Debt Financing, by any Alta Company immediately following the
Closing, (vii) each Alta Company executing and delivering reasonable and
customary certificates (including, without limitation, a customary
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of each Alta Company with respect
to solvency matters), customary management representation letters and other
customary documentation required by the Debt Financing Sources and the
definitive documentation related to the Debt Financing, _provided_ , that no
such certificates, letters or other documentation shall be effective prior to
the consummation of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, (viii) furnishing
Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date (to the
extent requested at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date),
with all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act and (ix) otherwise reasonably
cooperating in Parent's efforts to obtain the Financing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of any Alta Company, (B) no Alta Company shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
Liability or obligation in connection with the Financing prior to the Closing,
(C) no Alta Company nor any of their respective officers, directors, or
employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any agreement
with respect to the Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that
would be effective prior to the Closing (other than any customary management
representation and authorization letter in connection with marketing
materials contemplated by the Financing) and (D) Persons who are on the
board of directors or the board of managers (or similar governing body) of
any Alta Company prior to the Closing in their capacity as such shall not be
required to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution
of the Financing. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.15(f)_ or otherwise
shall require any Alta Company, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer
or other obligor with respect to the Financing.

  



    

62

 



    



  

(h) None of Equityholder, the Alta Companies, their Affiliates or any of
their respective representatives shall be required to take any action that
would subject such Person to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost
or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this _Section 6.15(g)_ or any
information utilized in connection therewith. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless Equityholder, the Alta Companies, their Affiliates and their
respective representatives from and against any and all Loss suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under this _Section 6.15(g)_ and
any information utilized in connection therewith, for any of the foregoing to
the extent the same is the result of (i) claims based upon the accuracy of
any historical information provided by or on behalf of Equityholder, any Alta
Company or their respective Affiliates and representatives expressly for use
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or (ii) the gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud committed by or on behalf of
Equityholder, any Alta Company or their respective Affiliates and
representatives. Parent shall, promptly upon receipt of a reasonably detailed
invoice from the Equityholder or Alta Company, reimburse the Equityholder or
the Alta Company and their Affiliates for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by the Equityholder or Alta Company or respective their
Affiliates (including those of its accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
agents and other representatives) in connection with the cooperation required
by this _Section 6.15(g)_.

  



  

Section 6.16  _Non-Competition; Non-Solicit; Non-Disparagement;
Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) From the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, Equityholder shall not independently or through any of his Affiliates,
directly or indirectly, engage in (whether as an owner, officer, manager,
employee, partner, agent, member, principal, consultant, representative or
otherwise) any activity that competes with the business of any Alta Company; 
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit the Equityholder, or any of
his respective Affiliates from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of
the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded
so long as none of such Persons has any active participation in the business
of such corporation. The geographic territory to which this _Section
6.16(a)_ extends is the United States and any other jurisdiction where the
Company operates as of the Closing Date or operated within the five (5) years
preceding the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) The Equityholder agrees that for a period of five (5) years following the
Closing Date he shall not (and shall cause his Affiliates not to) directly,
or indirectly through another Person, (i) induce or attempt to induce any
employee or contractor of Parent or any of its Affiliates to leave the employ
of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between Parent or any of its Affiliates and any employee or
contractor thereof, (ii) hire any person who was an employee of Parent or any
of its Affiliates at any time during the preceding twelve (12)-month period
(it being conclusively presumed by the parties so as to avoid any disputes
under this _Section 6.16_ that any such hiring within such twelve (12)-month
period is in violation of clause (i) above), or (iii) call on, solicit or
service any customer, supplier or other business relation of the Parent or
any of its Affiliates (including any Person that was a customer, supplier or
other business relation of Company with respect to the business at any time
during the eighteen (18)-month period immediately prior to the Closing),
induce or attempt to induce such Person to cease doing business with the
Parent or any of its Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between any such customer, supplier or business relation and the
business, Parent or any of its Affiliates (including making any negative
statements or communications about the Alta Companies, Parent or any of its
Affiliates).

  



  

(c) The Equityholder shall not, and shall cause his Affiliates not to, make
any oral or written statement that disparages or places the Alta Companies or
Parent in respect thereof in a false or negative light, except in connection
with a legal proceeding in which Company, Equityholder or such Affiliate,
officer, or director is under oath or responding to a subpoena or is
otherwise required by Law to cooperate with a Governmental Authority.

  



    

63

 



    



  

(d) If, at the time of enforcement of the covenants contained in this
_Section 6.16_, (the " _Restrictive Covenants_ ") a court shall hold that
the duration, scope or the geographic area stated herein are unreasonable
under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum
duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration, scope or area and that the court shall
be allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover
the maximum period, scope and area permitted by Law. Equityholder has
consulted with legal counsel regarding the Restrictive Covenants and based on
such consultation has determined and hereby acknowledges that the Restrictive
Covenants are reasonable in terms of duration, scope and area restrictions
and are necessary to protect the goodwill of Parent or any of its Affiliates'
businesses and the substantial investment made by Parent hereunder.

  



  

(e) If the Equityholder breaches, or threatens to commit a breach of, any of
the Restrictive Covenants, Parent shall have the following rights and
remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of the others
and severally enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not in
lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Parent or any of its
Affiliates at law or in equity:

  



  

(i) the right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants specifically
enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any
breach or threatened breach of the Restrictive Covenants would cause
irreparable injury to Parent or such Affiliate and that money damages would
not provide an adequate remedy to Parent or such Affiliate; and

  



  

(ii) the right and remedy to require the Equityholder to account for and pay
over to Parent or such Affiliate any profits, monies, accruals, increments or
other benefits derived or received by such Person as the result of any
transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive Covenants.

  



  

In the event of any breach or violation by the Equityholder of any of the
Restrictive Covenants, the time period of such covenant shall be tolled until
such breach or violation is resolved by a final determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator.

  



  

(f) From and after the Closing and the Equityholder shall, and shall direct
each his representatives, to hold in confidence and not disclose to any other
Person, any Confidential Information. If Equityholder or any of his
representatives are requested or required by Law to disclose any such
information, Equityholder shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
promptly notify Parent in writing and may disclose, without Liability
hereunder, only that portion of such information which, based on the
advice of counsel, is legally required to be disclosed; _provided_ , that
Equityholder shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information.

  



  

Section 6.17  _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_. On or before the
Closing Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 6.17_ hereto, and except for
this Agreement and any ancillary agreements contemplated herein and for
Liabilities relating to employment relationships and the payment of
compensation and benefits in the Ordinary Course of Business, all Liabilities
and obligations of the Alta Companies under any Contract or arrangement
contemplated by _Section 3.26_ shall be terminated in full as of the
completion of Closing without Liability to the Alta Companies and, from and
after the completion of Closing, the Alta Companies shall have no surviving
obligations or Liabilities to any other party to such Contract or arrangements
whatsoever with respect to any such Contract or arrangement.

will cause Alta Holding Company, LLC and Alta Holding Partnership, LLC to

prior to the Closing only as follows:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Equityholder and Parent;

  



  

(b) by either the Equityholder or Parent by written notice to the other if
any applicable Law is in effect making the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby illegal or any final, non-appealable Order is in effect
permanently preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this
Agreement results in or causes such final, non-appealable Order or other
action;

  



  

(c) by either the Equityholder or Parent by written notice to the other if
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have
occurred on or before June 12, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
that if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby by the
Outside Date is a result of a continuing investigation by a
Governmental Entity under Antitrust Laws or the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated hereby not having
expired or been terminated, then, upon written notice and election provided by
either the Equityholder or Parent, the " _Outside Date_ " may upon such
notice and election be extended once for up to an additional thirty (30) days
thereafter;  _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this

(d) by the Equityholder, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches in any material
respect any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement
or breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would
render a condition precedent to Equityholder' obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ or _Section
2.4(c)_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform to Parent and Merger Sub by the
Equityholder, cannot be cured or has not been cured by the earlier of the
Outside Date and ten (10) Business Days after the delivery of such notice;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under

respect any of their representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement or the Company or the Equityholder breach or fail to perform in any
material respect any of their covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (A) would render a condition precedent to
Parent's or Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ or _Section 2.4(b)_ not
capable of being satisfied, and (B) after the giving of written notice of such
breach or failure to perform to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub, cannot

contained in this Agreement, or (ii) if the Company Shareholder Approval is

(f) by Equityholder, if (i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 2.4(a)_ and _Section 2.4(b)_ were satisfied or waived as of the
date the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (other than the condition set forth in _Section 2.4(a)(iv)_ and
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and
could have been satisfied or would have been waived assuming a Closing would
occur), (ii) Equityholder has certified in writing to Parent and Merger Sub
that the Equityholder and the Company are ready, willing and able to

Section 7.2  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall immediately become
null and void, without any Liability on the part of any Party or any other
Person, and all rights and obligations of each Party shall cease; _provided_
, that (a) the Confidentiality Agreement and the agreements contained in
_Section 6.7(a)_, _Section 6.8_, this _Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_
of this Agreement survive any termination of this Agreement and remain in
full force and effect and (b) no such termination shall (i) relieve any Party
from any Liability arising out of or incurred as a result of its breach of the
terms of this Agreement prior to such termination or (ii) impair the right of
any Party hereto to compel specific performance by any other Party of
such Party's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.3  _Expense Reimbursement_.

  



  

(a) If the Equityholder or the Company terminated this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(f)_ or this Agreement is terminated at a time when the
Equityholder or the Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7.1(f)_, Parent shall pay to the Company a fee equal to
$1,500,000 (the " _Expense Reimbursement Fee_ ") within five (5) Business
Days after the termination of this Agreement to the Company by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated in
writing by the Company.

  



  

(b) Each of the Parties hereto agrees that if this Agreement is terminated
and the Expense Reimbursement Fee is due and payable, the Expense
Reimbursement Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the
Equityholder and their Affiliates and all direct and indirect equityholders
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the
Parent and any of their respective direct or indirect, former, current or
future stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers,
employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, Affiliates, agents
or assignees (each, a " _Parent Related Party_ ") for any breach of this
Agreement by Parent or any losses suffered hereunder or under any other
agreement executed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Subject to the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, upon the
Company's receipt of full payment of the Expense Reimbursement Fee, (i) no
Parent Related Party shall have any further Liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in
connection herewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination thereof), (ii) neither the Company, the
Equityholder nor any of their Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any Proceeding against any Parent Related Party arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, any contract or agreement executed in
connection herewith or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis
for such termination and (iii) the Company and the Equityholder shall cause
any Proceeding pending in connection with this Agreement, any contract or
agreement executed in connection herewith or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof),
to the extent maintained by the Company or the Equityholder against any
Parent Related Party, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any
event within five (5) Business Days after the payment of the Expense
Reimbursement Fee. The Company shall not be entitled to collect the Expense
Reimbursement Fee on more than one occasion.

  



    

66

 



    



  

(c) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Expense Reimbursement
Fee, as and when payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, is not intended to
be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate the party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which
such amount is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision.

Section 8.3  _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by any Party (including by operation of Law) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties; _provided further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may assign its rights under this
Agreement to its lenders providing financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt Financing Sources) for
collateral security purposes, it being understood that no such assignment
shall relieve Parent of any of its obligations hereunder. In the event the
Company or any of its successors or assigns, (a) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, the successors and
assigns of the Company shall be deemed to have assumed the obligations set
forth in _Section 6.11_.

  



  

Section 8.4  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
held to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under
applicable Law in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision,
there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid
and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

Section 8.5  _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or
Exhibit attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the
meanings set forth in this Agreement. The use of the word " _including_
" herein shall mean "including without limitation." The use of the word "
_Ordinary Course of Business_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person, any
action taken by such Person in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice. The words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
References herein to a specific Section, Subsection, Recital, Schedule or
Exhibit shall refer, respectively, to Sections, Subsections,
Recitals, Schedules or Exhibits of this Agreement. Terms defined in the
singular shall have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice
versa. References herein to any gender shall include each other gender. The
word "or" shall not be exclusive unless the context clearly requires the
selection of one (but not more than one) of a number of items. References to
"written" or "in writing" include in electronic form. References herein to any
Person shall include such Person's heirs, executors, personal
representatives, administrators, successors and assigns; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 8.5_ is intended to
authorize any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by this
Agreement. References herein to a Person in a particular capacity or
capacities shall exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any reference to
"days" shall mean calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified;
_provided_ , that if any action is required to be done or taken on a day that

not on such day but on the first succeeding Business Day thereafter.
References herein to any Contract or agreement (including this Agreement)
mean such Contract or agreement as amended, restated, supplemented or modified
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ , that
with respect to any Contract listed (or required to be listed) on
the Disclosure Schedules, all amendments, modifications, supplements,
extensions and renewals thereto (but excluding any purchase orders, work
orders or statements of work) must also be listed on the appropriate schedule
and disclosed. With respect to the determination of any period of time, the
word "from" means "from and including" and the words "to" and "until" each
means "to but excluding." References herein to any Law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If any party has
breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein
in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the
relative levels of specificity) which the party has not breached shall not
detract from or mitigate the fact that the party is in breach of the first
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" (or similar phrases) shall mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".

meaning assigned to it in accordance with GAAP. Except where otherwise
expressly provided, all amounts in this Agreement are stated and shall be
paid in United States currency. The Parties and their respective counsel have
reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and
understanding of the Parties, and the language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
Person. Any information or materials shall be deemed provided, made available
or delivered to Parent if such information or materials have been uploaded to

on the Project Canyon, Venue online-platform provided by Donnelley Financial
Solutions for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Data Room_ ") or otherwise provided to Parent's representatives

set out in the preceding sentence has been stored on six identical encrypted
USB devices prepared by Donnelley Financial Solutions, of which Equityholder
and Parent each received three for evidentiary purposes on the date hereof.

Section 8.6  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements and
documents referred to herein contain the entire agreement and understanding
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to
such subject matter in any way. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, Liabilities and obligations with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arm's-length negotiations and no Person has any special relationship with
another Person that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length transaction.

  



  

Section 8.7  _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and
agreements, certificates, instruments and documents entered into in
connection herewith may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts
and by fax or email, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement. No Party shall raise the
use of a fax machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a fax machine or email as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a Contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 8.8  _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The Law of
the State of New York shall govern (a) all claims or matters related to or
arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and
(b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and
enforceability of this Agreement, and the performance of the
obligations imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to
any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, all
disputes against any Debt Financing Source under the Debt Commitment Letter
related to this Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its
execution, whether in contract, tort or otherwise (including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter), will be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within
such State, without regard to conflict of law principles that would result in
the application of any law other than the law of the State of New York. Each
party to this Agreement hereby IRREVOCABLY waives all rights to trial by jury
in any action, suit or Proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or
among any of the parties (whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of, connected with, related or incidental to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby and/or the relationships established among
the parties hereunder (INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, WITH RESPECT TO
THE DEBT FINANCING OR INVOLVING OR AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE). THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the
Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Courts of the
State of New York or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the federal
court sitting in the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, in any action or Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action or Proceeding
shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other courts.
Nothing in this _Section 8.8_, however, shall affect the right of any Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each
Party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law or at equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the
Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action against the Debt
Financing Sources, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to any Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise, in any forum other than exclusively in federal
court sitting in the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York.

Section 8.9  _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and Equityholder
acknowledges that Parent has established the Trust Account for the benefit of
its public stockholders, which holds proceeds of its initial public offering.
For and in consideration of Parent entering into this Agreement and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, each of the Company and Equityholder, for themselves and
the Affiliates they have the authority to bind, hereby agree they do not now
and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to any assets in the Trust Account (or
distributions therefrom to Parent's public stockholders), and hereby waives
any claims it has or may have at any time against or with respect to the
Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to Parent's public stockholders) as
a result of, or arising out of, any discussions, contracts or agreements
(including this Agreement) among Parent, Equityholder and the Company or the
Company's shareholders and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
(or distributions therefrom to Parent's public stockholders) for any reason
whatsoever.

  



  

Section 8.10  _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the
non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at Law) and the non-
breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees
that each other Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an
injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding, in addition to any other
remedy to which such Person may be entitled.

  



  

Section 8.11  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other than
the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights
hereunder (other than (a) in respect of the Parent Indemnified Parties, the
Equityholder Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Persons and Non-Party
Affiliates, each of whom is an express third-party beneficiary hereunder and
entitled to enforce certain obligations hereunder and (b) in respect of the
Debt Financing Sources, each of whom (i) is an express third-party
beneficiary of _Section 8.1_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.8_, _Section
8.13 _and this _Section 8.11_ to the extent such sections affect the rights
and obligations of the Debt Financing Sources and (ii) shall be entitled to
enforce such provisions and rely thereon).

  



  

Section 8.12  _Schedules_. All Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto or
referred to herein and the recitals to this Agreement are (a) each hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein and (b) qualified in their entirety by reference to specific
provisions of this Agreement. Any fact or item disclosed in any Section of
the Schedules shall be deemed disclosed in each other Section of the Schedule
to which such fact or item may apply so long as (x) such other Section is
referenced by applicable cross-reference or (y) it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other
Section or Schedule. The headings contained in the Schedules are for
convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence
the interpretation of the information contained in these Schedules or the
Agreement. The Schedules are not intended to constitute, and shall not be
construed as, an admission or indication that any such fact or item is
required to be disclosed. The Schedules shall not be deemed to expand in any
way the scope or effect of any representations, warranties or covenants
described in this Agreement. Any fact or item, including the specification
of any dollar amount, disclosed in the Schedules shall not by reason only of
such inclusion be deemed to be material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of the
Agreement and matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily limited
to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected herein and may be
included solely for information purposes; and no Party shall use the fact of
the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in the
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in the Schedules is or
is not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside
of the Ordinary Course of Business. No disclosure in the Schedules
relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order
shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. The information contained in the
Schedules shall be kept strictly confidential by the Parties and no third
party may rely on any information disclosed or set forth therein. Moreover, in
disclosing the information in the Schedules, Equityholder expressly do not
waive any attorney-client privilege associated with such information or any
protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the
matters disclosed or discussed therein.

Section 8.13  _No Recourse to Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (a) in no event shall
Equityholder, the Alta Companies or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives (i) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Debt Financing Source or Equity Financing Source in connection with
this Agreement or (ii) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any
claims for breach of any Commitment Letter against, or seek to recover
monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, any Debt Financing Source or Equity
Financing Source for the Financing in connection with (y) this Agreement or
(z) the obligations of the Debt Financing Sources or Equity Financing Sources
for the Financing under the applicable Commitment Letter; it being
agreed that the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall include the agreement
not to commence (and, if commenced, agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate,
and not to assist) any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation,
litigation, petition, grievance, complaint, suit or proceeding against any
Debt Financing Source or Equity Financing Source, and (b) the Equityholder and
the Alta Companies on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates
and representatives hereby (i) acknowledges that no Debt Financing Source or
Equity Financing Source shall have any liability to the Equityholder or any
Alta Company under this Agreement or for any claim made by the Equityholder
or any Alta Company based on, in respect of, or by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any dispute relating to,
or arising from, the Cash Equity, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment
Letters or the performance thereof, (ii) waives any rights or claims of any
kind or nature (whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) the Equityholder or any Alta Company may have against any Debt
Financing Source or Equity Financing Source relating to this Agreement, the
Cash Equity, the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letters or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Nothing in this _Section 8.13_
shall in any way limit or qualify the rights and obligations of (x) the Debt
Financing Sources or Equity Financing Sources for the applicable Financing and
the other parties to the Financing (or the definitive documents related
thereto) to each other thereunder or in connection therewith and (y)
Equityholder against Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, no Debt
Financing Source or Equity Financing Source shall be subject to any special,
consequential, punitive or indirect damages or damages of a tortious nature
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
Financing or the Debt Commitment Letters.

(the " _Board_ ") is hereby expressly authorized to provide out of the

in a certificate of designation (a " _Preferred Stock Designation_ ") filed
pursuant to the DGCL, and the Board is hereby expressly vested with the
authority to the full extent provided by law, now or hereafter, to adopt any
such resolution or resolutions.

  



  

Section 4.3 _Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Voting_.

  



  

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the
Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the
Corporation.

  



  

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Third Amended and Restated

shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on
each matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of
the Common Stock are entitled to vote.

Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Common
Stock shall have the exclusive right to vote for the election of directors
and on all other matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law or this
Third Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), holders of shares of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote
on any amendment to this Third Amended and Restated Certificate (including
any amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the
terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of
such affected series of Preferred Stock, are entitled exclusively, either
separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to
vote thereon pursuant to this Third Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) or the DGCL.

  



  

(b) _Dividends_. Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock , the holders of

distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the Corporation)
when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time out of any
assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and shall share
equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions.

  



  

(c) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation_ _._ Subject

ARTICLE V 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 5.1 _Board Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by, or under the direction of, the Board. In addition to the
powers and authority expressly conferred upon the Board by statute, this Third
Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws of the Corporation (" _Bylaws_
"), the Board is hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all
such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation, subject,
nevertheless, to the provisions of the DGCL, this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate and any Bylaws adopted by the stockholders; provided, however,
that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any
prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been
adopted.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Number, Election and Term_.

  



  

(a) The number of directors of the Corporation, other than those who may be
elected by the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock voting
separately by class or series, shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by
the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into two
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I and
Class II. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board already in
office to Class I or Class II. The term of the initial Class I Directors
shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation following the effectiveness of this Third Amended and Restated
Certificate and the term of the initial Class II Directors shall expire
at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following
the effectiveness of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate. At each
succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning
with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
following the effectiveness of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate,
each of the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term
expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a two-year term or until
the election and qualification of their respective successors in office,
subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to _Section
5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors that constitutes the Board is
changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the
classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly
equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to
the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of
one or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be
determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in
person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon.
The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by resolution or resolutions
thereof, to assign members of the Board already in office to the aforesaid
classes at the time this Third Amended and Restated Certificate (and therefore
such classification) becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

(c) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to _Section
5.5_ hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be
filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining directors
then in office, even if less than a quorum or by a sole remaining director
(and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office for
the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which the new
directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's
earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_ , and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more
directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal from
office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Third Amended
and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation) and such
directors shall not be included in any of the classes created pursuant to
this _Article V_ unless expressly provided by such terms.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Quorum_. A quorum for the transaction of business by the
directors shall be set forth in the Bylaws.

  



  

ARTICLE VI 
 BYLAWS

  



  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board
shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws
also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders;
provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this
Third Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock
Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the
voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no
Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of
the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

  



  

Section 7.1 _Annual Meetings_. Except as otherwise expressly provided by
law, the annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors and for
the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting
shall be held at such date, time and place, if any, as shall be determined
exclusively by resolution of the Board in its sole and absolute discretion.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Special Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the
requirements of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief
Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a
majority of the Board, and the ability of the stockholders to call a special
meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except as provided in the foregoing
sentence, special meetings of stockholders may not be called by another
person or persons.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for
the election of directors and of business to be brought by
stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall
be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 7.4 _No Action by Written Consent_. Subject to the rights, if any,
of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action
required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must
be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders
and may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders of the
Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII 
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. To the full extent permitted
by the DGCL and any other applicable law currently or hereafter in effect, a
director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation
or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended unless they violated their duty of loyalty to the Corporation
or its stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated
the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases
or unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from their
actions as directors. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing
sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior
to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to
the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_  or otherwise. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section 8.2_
shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_ , except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

  



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Third
Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Third Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section
8.2_ , shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except
to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted
prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any
right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or
adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding
(regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or
completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior
to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

ARTICLE IX 
 AMENDMENT OF THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

  



  

The Corporation reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Third Amended
and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), and
other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time
in force that may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL; and,
except as set forth in _Article VIII_ , all rights, preferences and privileges
of whatever nature herein conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons by and pursuant to this Third Amended and Restated Certificate in its
present form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the right reserved
in this _Article IX_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Third Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws, and notwithstanding
that a lesser percentage or vote may be permitted from time to time by
applicable law, no provision of Article IV, Article V, Article VI,
Article VIII and this Article IX (except by virtue of a filing of a Preferred
Stock Designation, but subject to any vote required by law or by other
provisions of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate with respect to such
Preferred Stock Designation) may be altered, amended or repealed in any
respect, nor may any provision of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate
or of the Bylaws inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless in addition to any
other vote required by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate or
otherwise required by law, such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is
approved at a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662⁄3% of the voting power of all
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

ARTICLE X 
 EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS

  



  

Section 10.1 _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (the " _Court of Chancery_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive forum
for any stockholder (including a beneficial owner) to bring (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director,
officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the
Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any
provision of the DGCL or this Third Amended and Restated Certificate or the
Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery,
or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors,
officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for,
as to each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for
which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D)
arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the Court
of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall
have concurrent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions
of this _Section 10.1_ will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or
liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any
other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Any
person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any
security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented
to the provisions of this _Section 10.1_.

  



  

Section 10.2 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. If any action the subject matter of
which is within the scope of _Section 10.1_ immediately above is filed in a
court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a " _Foreign
Action_ ") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed
to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any
action brought in any such court to enforce _Section 10.1_  immediately above
(an " _FSC Enforcement Action_ ") and (ii) having service of process made upon
such stockholder in any such FSC Enforcement Action by service upon such
stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

  



  

Section 10.3 _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
X_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to
any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of
such provisions in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of
this _Article X_ (including, without limitation, each portion of any sentence
of this _Article X_ containing any such provision held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other persons or
entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest
in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice
of and consented to the provisions of this _Article X_.

ARTICLE XI

  

SECTION 203 OF THE DGCL

  



  

The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of
the DGCL as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any successor
statute thereto, and the restrictions contained in Section 203 of the DGCL

by the Holder will not violate any provision of the organizational documents

and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective
successors and permitted assigns that the Holder has not: (i) sold, assigned,
pledged, given, encumbered, transferred or otherwise deposited under any
agreement or hypothecated any stock certificate evidencing ownership of the
Company Stock or any interest therein; (ii) signed any power of attorney or
any authorization respecting the same or given any person or party any
transfer, power of attorney, stock power or other authority of any kind or

Holder has, or has asserted, any right, title, claim, equity interest in, to,
or respecting any stock certificate evidencing ownership of the Company Stock
or the proceeds of any of the foregoing. The Holder acknowledges that Merger
Sub, Parent, the Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates are
relying on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the
Holder set forth herein in connection with entering into the Agreement,
accepting this Letter of Transmittal and making any payments
contemplated hereunder or pursuant to the Agreement.

  



  

If Holder will receive Parent Shares (as defined below), the Holder further
represents and warrants to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their
respective successors and permitted assigns that:

  



  

(a) The Holder is an "Accredited Investor" as such term is defined in Rule
501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_
"). The Holder will acquire the Parent Shares for its own account solely for
investment purposes and not for the account of others or with a view to the
distribution or resale of such Parent Shares or any interests therein.

  



  

(b) The Holder has received and carefully read and understands this Letter of
Transmittal. The Holder has been furnished with all other materials relating
to Parent and the offering (the " _Offering_ ") of shares of common stock of
B. Riley Principal Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation (the " _Parent
Shares_ "), par value $0.0001 per share if any, which have been requested by
the Holder. Furthermore, the Holder has been afforded an opportunity to ask
questions of, and receive answers from, Parent in connection with the
Offering.

  



  

(c) The Holder acknowledges that: (i) the offer and sale of the Parent Shares
has not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the
securities laws of any U.S. state or non-U.S. jurisdiction, and that the offer
and sale of the Parent Shares is being made in reliance upon federal and
state exemptions for transactions not involving a public offering; and (ii)
the Parent Shares may not be resold or transferred except as permitted by the
Securities Act and any applicable U.S. state or non-U.S. securities laws,
pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom.

  



    

\- 3 -

 



    



  

(d) The Holder understands that neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission nor any other federal, state or non-U.S. agency has recommended,
approved or endorsed the purchase of the Parent Shares as an investment or
passed on the accuracy or adequacy of the information set forth in this
letter agreement or any other documents used in connection with the Offering.
The Holder has relied on his, her or its own examination of Parent and the
terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved, and has
reviewed the merits and risks of the purchase of the Parent Shares with tax,
legal and investment counsel to the extent deemed advisable by the Holder.

  



  

(e) The Holder has obtained, in the judgment of the Holder, sufficient
information to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in Parent. The
Holder has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters to evaluate the merits and risks associated with such investment and
to make an informed investment decision with respect thereto. The Holder has
not relied and will not rely upon any representations made by, or other
information (whether oral or written) furnished by or on behalf of, Parent or
any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or
representatives.

  



  

(f) The Holder understands that the purchase of the Parent Shares represents
a highly speculative investment, which involves a high degree of risk of
loss. The Holder cannot expect to be able to liquidate any investment in
Parent in the case of an emergency, or perhaps at all. The Holder has
adequate means to provide for the Holder's current cash needs and possible
contingencies, and his, her or its financial condition is such that he, she
or it can afford to bear all risks associated with the purchase of the
Parent Shares. The Holder has the financial capacity to hold the Parent
Shares for an indefinite period of time and can afford to suffer the complete
loss thereof.

  



  

(g) The Holder confirms that the Parent Shares were not offered to the Holder
by any means of general solicitation or general advertising. The Holder,
either directly or indirectly through its beneficial owners, as applicable,
has a pre-existing business relationship with Parent.

  



  

 _Trust Account Waiver_. The Holder hereby acknowledges that Parent has
established a segregated trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the
benefit of its public shareholders, which holds proceeds of its initial public
offering. For and in consideration of Parent entering into discussions with
the Holder relating to this Letter of Transmittal, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Holder, for himself, herself or itself and the affiliates
he, she or it has the authority to bind, hereby agrees that he, she or it
does not now and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any assets in the Trust Account (or
distributions therefrom to Parent's public shareholders), and hereby waives
any claims he, she or it has or may have at any time against or with respect
to the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to Parent's public
shareholders) as a result of, or arising out of, any discussions, contracts
or agreements (including this Letter of Transmittal) among Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Equityholder and the Holder, and will not seek recourse
against the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to Parent's public
shareholders) for any reason whatsoever.

  



  

 _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements made
herein by the Holder shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and the
Closing. All authority conferred in this Letter of Transmittal and any
obligation hereunder shall not be affected by, and shall survive, the death
or incapacity of the Holder and any obligation of the Holder will be binding
upon the successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives of the Holder.

  



    

\- 4 -

 



    



  

 _Payments_. By signing this Letter of Transmittal, the Holder agrees that
payment of any amounts to the account designated per this Letter of
Transmittal and the funds transfer instructions on the signature page to this
Letter of Transmittal (the " _Funds Transfer Instructions_ ") shall
constitute payment to and, upon delivery to such account, payment received by
the Holder. The Holder hereby waives and releases any and all claims, solely
to the extent relating to the payment to the account designated in this
Letter of Transmittal and the Funds Transfer Instructions (other than with
respect to amount), that the Holder may have against any party relying on
this Letter of Transmittal and the Funds Transfer Instructions (including
Parent, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub and each of their respective
Affiliates), including, without limitation, the failure of the Holder to
receive amounts due and owing to the Holder which were transmitted according
to this Letter of Transmittal and the Funds Transfer Instructions.

  



  

 _Third Party Beneficiaries; Assignment_. The Holder expressly acknowledges
and agrees that Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company are intended to
be express third party beneficiaries of this Letter of Transmittal. The Holder
may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of the Holder's rights or
obligations under this Letter of Transmittal without the prior
written consent of the Surviving Entity and the Equityholder.

  



  

 _Additional Documentation_. The undersigned shall, upon request, execute and
deliver any additional documents reasonably deemed appropriate or
necessary by the Exchange Agent and/or Parent in connection with the
surrender of the shares of Company Stock. All authority conferred or agreed
to be conferred in this Letter of Transmittal shall be binding upon the
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal
representatives of the undersigned and shall not be affected by, and shall
survive, the death or incapacity of the undersigned. The surrender of shares
hereby is irrevocable.

  



  

 _Release._  The Holder, on behalf of himself and his past, present, and
future parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, divisions, related
companies, successors, joint ventures and assigns, hereby releases and
discharges each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and each of
their respective past, present, and future parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates,
divisions, related companies, joint ventures, and each of their respective
past and present managers, directors, officers, agents, trustees, attorneys,
employees, members/stockholders, representatives, benefit plan fiduciaries
and administrators, assigns and successors from any and all obligations and
Liabilities (whether directly or indirectly) of any kind or nature
whatsoever, as to facts, conditions, transactions, events or
circumstances prior to the Closing, and Holder and his past, present, and
future parents, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, divisions, related
companies, successors, joint ventures and assigns shall not seek to recover
any amounts in connection therewith from any of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company.

  



  

The Holder acknowledges and agrees that the terms and provisions under this
section have been a material inducement to Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Letter of
Transmittal and the Agreement and that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have relied upon this section in consummating such transactions.

  



  

 _Miscellaneous_. The Holder hereby agrees and acknowledges that Section 8.8
(Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction) of the Agreement shall
apply to this Letter of Transmittal as if set forth herein.

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, you would be entitled to receive a
lump sum payment in the event of a Change in Control of the Company in an
amount equal to the value of the number of vested Equity Linked Incentive
Units in your account times the Equity Linked Incentive Unit Value, plus an
amount equal to the value of the Equity Linked Incentive Appreciation Rights
in your Account times the Equity Linked Incentive Appreciation Right Value,
subject to certain adjustments or forfeitures as provided under the Plan.
Irrespective of whether the Transaction will constitute a Change in Control
of the Company, the Company has proposed terminating the Plan, the Agreement,
and your [__] Equity Linked Inventive Units and [__] Equity Linked Incentive
Appreciation Rights granted thereunder (the "Awards", and such termination,
the "Termination"), contingent upon the consummation of the transactions
anticipated in connection with the Transaction ("Closing").

  

In consideration of the Termination and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Company and you hereby agree that, contingent upon the
Closing and your continued employment with the Company through that date,
within 30 days after the date on which Closing occurs, you will be entitled to
a single payment of $_________, less applicable taxes and withholdings (the
"Payment") and the issuance to you of ____________ shares of Class A common
stock of B. Riley Principal Merger Corp. (the "Issuance")[1], in full
satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Agreement and the Plan
with respect to the Awards. Please countersign this letter indicating that
you (x) consent to the Termination, (y) acknowledge and agree that in
connection with the Termination, the Payment and the Issuance are the sole
and only benefits due to you under the Agreement, the Plan and the Awards and
(z) release the Company, Holdings and their respective affiliates from any
further obligation to you, your beneficiaries, or anyone acting on your or
their behalf with respect to the Agreement, the Plan and the Awards once the
Payment and Issuance are made.

  

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. [1] Your right to receive the Issuance is subject to your execution and
delivery to Holdings of an accredited investor questionnaire confirming your
status as an accredited investor.

practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within forty-five (45)
days after the Closing Date, file a Registration Statement under the
Securities Act to permit the public resale of all the Registrable Securities
held by the Holders from time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under
the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the
Commission then in effect) on the terms and conditions specified in this
_Section 2.1_ and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable after
the filing thereof, but in any event no later than the earlier of (a) sixty
(60) days (or ninety (90) days if the Commission notifies the Company that it
will "review" the Registration Statement) after the Closing Date and (b) the
tenth (10th) Business Day after the date the Company is notified (orally or
in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that such Registration
Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to further review
(such earlier date, the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ "). The Registration
Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall be
on Form S-1 or such other form of registration statement as is then available
to effect a registration for resale of such Registrable Securities, covering
such Registrable Securities, and shall contain a Prospectus in such form as to

combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holders.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause a

to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,
that another registration statement is available, for the resale of all the
Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such Registrable
Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. As soon as
practicable following the effective date of a Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ , but in any event within three (3) Business
Days of such date, the Company shall notify the Holders of the effectiveness
of such Registration Statement. When effective, a Registration Statement
filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ (including any documents incorporated
therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus contained in
such Registration Statement, in the light of the circumstances under which
such statement is made).

part of such Registrable Securities that are registered by such Registration
Statement, then the Company shall, upon the written demand of Greenawalt or
his designee (any such Holder, a " _Demanding Holder_ "), enter into
an underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings
of equity securities with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected
by the Demanding Holder in consultation with the Company, and shall take all
such other reasonable actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities. In addition, the Company shall give prompt written
notice to each other Holder regarding such proposed Underwritten Offering,
and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to include in the
Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities as each such
Holder may request. Each such Holder shall make such request in writing to the
Company within five Business Days after the receipt of any such notice from
the Company, which request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Holder. Each Holder proposing to
distribute its Registrable Securities through an Underwritten
Offering pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall enter into an underwriting
agreement with the underwriters, which underwriting agreement shall contain
such representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to _Article IV_ ) and
other rights and obligations as are customary in underwritten offerings of
equity securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Holder shall be
required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the
Company or the Underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Holder's authority to enter into such underwriting
agreement and to sell, and its ownership of, the securities being registered
on its behalf, its intended method of distribution and any other
representation required by law.

(b) If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering,

Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the proposed offering price,
the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of success of such
offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as
applicable, the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then the Company shall
include in such Underwritten Offering, as follows:

  



  

(i) _first_ , the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders pro rata

been reached under the foregoing clause (i) or clause (ii), to shares of
Common Stock held by persons or entities that the Company is obligated to
register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons, which collectively can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and

  



  

(iv) _fourth_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing _clause (i) , clause (ii)_, or clause
(iii), shares of Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company
desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities.

  



  

(c) A Demanding Holder shall have the right to withdraw all or any portion of
its Registrable Securities included in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to
this _Section 2.2_ for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification
to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of its intention to
withdraw from such Underwritten Offering prior to the pricing of such
Underwritten Offering and such withdrawn amount shall no longer be considered
an Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with an Underwritten Offering prior to its withdrawal
under this _Section 2.2(c)_.

  



  

(d) The Company shall not be obligated to effect any Underwritten Offering
pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ (x) if the Demanding Holder, together with the
holders of any other securities of the Company entitled to inclusion in such
Underwritten Offering, propose to sell Registrable Securities and such other
securities (if any), the aggregate proceeds of which are anticipated to be
less than $15,000,000, or (y) in any particular jurisdiction in which the
Company would be required to execute a general consent to service of process

Section 2.3 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

(a) If at any time the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement
under the Securities Act with respect to an Underwritten Offering of equity
securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the
account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by the
stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ hereof) on a form that would permit registration of
Registrable Securities, other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in
connection with any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an
exchange offer or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing
stockholders, (iii) for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity
securities of the Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or (v)

"bought" offering, such requests must be made by the Holders within three
Business Days after the delivery of any such notice by the Company) (such
Registration a " _Piggyback Registration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the Company has been advised in writing by the managing Underwriter(s) that
the inclusion of Registrable Securities for sale for the benefit of
the Holders will have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution
of the Common Stock in the Underwritten Offering, then (1) if no Registrable
Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the
managing Underwriter(s), the Company shall not be required to offer such
opportunity to the Holders or (2) if any Registrable Securities can be
included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the managing
Underwriter(s), then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered for
the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of
_Section 2.3(b)_. Subject to _Section 2.3(b)_ , the Company shall, in good
faith, cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback
Registration and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Holders pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms
and conditions as any similar securities of the Company included in such
Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
If no written request for inclusion from a Holder is received within the
specified time, each such Holder shall have no further right to
participate in such Underwritten Offering. All such Holders proposing to
distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten
Offering under this _Section 2.3_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten
Offering by the Company.

from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written

such Holder's Registrable Securities as are specified in such written
request, together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities of any
other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in the

Section 4.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused
by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls
such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same
extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of
the Holder.

  



   

13

 



    



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation
to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable
Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received
by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify
the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

(c) Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such
money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such
settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The Company
and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also
agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party for contribution to such party in the event the Company's or such
Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



   

14

 



    



  

(e) If the indemnification provided under this _Section 4.1_ from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Holder under this _Section 4.1(e) _ shall be limited to
the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such offering giving
rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of
the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 4.1(a)_ , _Section
4.1(b)_ and _Section 4.1(c)_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.1(e)_ were
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
_Section 4.1(e)_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.1(e)_ from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 5.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations of the Company
hereunder may not be assigned or delegated by the Company in whole or in
part.

  



  

(b) This Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations of the Holders of
Registrable Securities hereunder may be freely assigned or delegated by such
Holder of Registrable Securities in conjunction with and to the extent of any
transfer of Registrable Securities by any such Holder.

  



  

(c) This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of each of the parties and its successors and the
permitted assigns of the Holders.

  



  

(d) This Agreement shall not confer any rights or benefits on any persons
that are not parties hereto, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement and this _Section 5.2_ , except that the Founder Holders, severally
and not jointly, _shall be express third party beneficiaries of Section
2.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section 2.3(b)_.

  



  

(e) No assignment by any party hereto of such party's rights, duties and
obligations hereunder shall be binding upon or obligate the Company unless
and until the Company shall have received (i) written notice of such
assignment as provided in _Section 5.1_ and (ii) the written agreement of the
assignee, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , to be bound by
the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Any transfer or assignment made
other than as provided in this _Section 5.2_ shall be null and void.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and agreements, certificates,
instruments and documents entered into in connection herewith may be executed
and delivered in one or more counterparts and by fax or email, each of which
shall be deemed an original and all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement. No party hereto shall raise the use of a fax machine or
email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a fax machine
or email as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and
each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

  



   

16

 



    



  

Section 5.4 _Governing Law_. The law of the State of Delaware shall govern
(a) all claims or matters related to or arising from this Agreement
(including any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions
concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of
this Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this
Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law or
conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement
hereby IRREVOCABLY waives all rights to trial by jury in any action, suit or
Proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or among any of the parties
(whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, connected
with, related or incidental to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and/or the relationships established among the parties hereunder. THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the
parties hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then
to the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all
claims in respect of the action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
any such court and agrees not to bring any proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this _Section
5.4_, however, shall affect the right of any party hereunder to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law or at equity.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto recognizes and affirms
that in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached, money
damages would be inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching party would have
no adequate remedy at law) and the non-breaching party would be
irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that each other
party hereof shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or
other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security or needing
to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any proceeding, in addition to any other remedy to which
such person may be entitled.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

  



   

17

 



    



  

Section 5.7 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not
modify, define or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether
written or oral, relating to such subject matter in any way.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the
Company and the Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions,
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of
such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment
hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in its
capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a
manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity)
shall require the consent of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing
between any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure
or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights
or remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or
remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver
or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date as of which
no Holders (or permitted assignees under _Section 5.2_ ) hold any Registrable
Securities. The provisions of _Section 3.5_ and _Article IV_ shall survive any
termination.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Further Assurances_. In connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the written request by the Company,
each Holder shall execute and deliver any additional documents and instruments
and perform any additional acts that may be reasonably necessary to
effectuate and perform the provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

materiality or material adverse effect qualifiers contained therein, are true
and correct as of the date hereof in all respects (or if such representations
and warranties expressly relate to a specific date, such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct as of such date in all material
respects) except in each case, to the extent such failure of the
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, when taken as a
whole, would not have a material adverse effect on Parent's or Merger Sub's
ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2\. Parent and Merger Sub have performed or complied in all material respects
with each covenant required by the Merger Agreement to be performed or
complied with (without giving effect to any materiality or similar qualifiers
