(the "Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth: (1) the Company's good

Capital, such Target Working Capital, and such Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment, if any, and such Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration based on

Agreement.

(b) At the Closing, in full consideration for the purchase by Purchaser of the
Blocker Units and the Company Units (subject to the adjustments set forth in
Section 2.3 hereof), Purchaser (i) shall issue or cause to be issued to
Sellers' Designee (or to such Sellers or Affiliates of the Sellers as may
otherwise be directed by Sellers' Designee (any such recipient, a "Seller
Recipient")), on behalf of and for delivery to the Sellers and designees of
the Sellers, the Aggregate Stock Consideration, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Liens created by such Seller or arising under applicable
securities Laws) and (ii) shall pay to Sellers' Designee (or as may otherwise
be directed to any Seller Recipient by Sellers' Designee), on behalf of and
for delivery to the Sellers and designees of the Sellers, (A) the Estimated
Aggregate Cash Consideration and (B) the Fractional Share Cash Amount, such
payment pursuant to this clause (ii) to be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Sellers' Designee in
writing to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;
provided, that any delay in the delivery of such wire instructions shall be
without prejudice to the Sellers' rights to receive the amounts payable
thereto pursuant to this clause (ii), which shall promptly be paid upon the
later of the Closing Date and the second Business Day following receipt of
such account notification.

(c) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers'
Designee shall notify Purchaser of the aggregate number of fractional share
interests that would otherwise be issued in exchange for Blocker Units or

Share Cash Amount to be delivered in lieu thereof. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock
shall be issued in exchange for Blocker Units or Company Units to Sellers'
Designee or any Seller Recipient, no dividend or distribution with respect to
Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional
share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the
issuance of any such fractional share, at Closing, Purchaser shall pay to
Sellers' Designee or any applicable Seller Recipient who otherwise would
receive any such fractional share, an aggregate amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Purchaser Closing Price by
(ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) of Purchaser Common Stock which Sellers' Designee or such
Seller Recipient would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.2(b) (such aggregate amount, the "Fractional Share Cash Amount"). 

(d) All shares of Purchaser Common Stock received by the Sellers or any Seller
Recipients pursuant to Section 2.2(b) shall bear a legend or legends (and
appropriate comparable notations or other arrangements will be made with
respect to any uncertificated shares) referencing restrictions on transfer of
such shares of Purchaser Common Stock under the Securities Act which legend
shall state in substance:

"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the
United States (each, a "State Act") in reliance upon certain exemptions from
registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this certificate
cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the United States
unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and in accordance
with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not subject to, the
Securities Act and each applicable State Act."

(e) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(d), the holder of any shares of Purchaser
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive from Purchaser new shares not
bearing such legend (or the elimination or termination of such notations or
arrangements) upon the request of such holder at such time as such
restrictions are no longer applicable in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser;
provided that if a holder of any shares of Purchaser Common Stock provides to
Purchaser an opinion of nationally recognized outside counsel, which may be
relied upon by outside counsel to Purchaser if required to furnish an
equivalent opinion to Purchaser's transfer agent, stating that the restriction
referenced in such legend is no longer required in order to ensure compliance
with the Securities Act, Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause its
transfer agent to deliver to such holder new shares not bearing such legend
reasonably promptly following the delivery of such opinion.

(f) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to the holders of the Payoff
Indebtedness an amount sufficient to repay all such Payoff Indebtedness with
the result that immediately following the Closing there shall be no further
monetary obligations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect
to any Payoff Indebtedness outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, as
set forth in the Payoff Letters.

(g) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay any amounts constituting Outstanding
Company Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed
by the Company to Purchaser at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

(h) Each Blocker Seller and GP Seller hereby direct the Purchaser to deliver
to the Sellers' Designee or any Seller Recipient designated by the Sellers'
Designee such Seller's Seller Consideration, and directs the Sellers' Designee
to receive on its behalf and thereafter disburse 

thereto, or to direct Purchaser to deliver to one or more Seller Recipients,
such Seller's Seller Consideration. The Sellers hereby designate the Sellers'
Designee as their representative, attorney-in-fact and agent and authorize the
Sellers' Designee (i) to make all decisions relating to the determination of
the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration and the Purchase Price Adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.3, (ii) to negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise
handle all disputes with the Purchaser regarding adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.3 and indemnification pursuant to ARTICLE X, (iii) to take all
action necessary in connection with the waiver of any condition to the
obligations of the Company, the Blocker and the Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, or the defense and/or settlement of any
claims for which the Sellers may be required to indemnify the Purchaser
pursuant to ARTICLE X, (iv) to give and receive all notices required to be
given under the Agreement and (v) to do each and every other act and exercise
any and all other rights which the Sellers collectively are permitted or
required to do or exercise under this Agreement. With respect to each payment
of cash that each Seller is entitled to receive under this Agreement, the
Sellers agree that Sellers' Designee shall round such payment to the nearest
cent. A decision, act, consent, instruction or action of the Sellers'
Designee, including any agreement between the Sellers' Designee and the
Purchaser relating to the determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment, the
Final Aggregate Cash Consideration or the defense or settlement of any claims
for which the Sellers may be required to indemnify the Purchaser pursuant to
ARTICLE X or, shall constitute a decision, act, consent, instruction or action
of all Sellers and shall be binding and conclusive upon each of such Sellers
and Purchaser and the Escrow Agent may rely upon any such decision, act,
consent, instruction or action as being the decision, act, consent or
instructions of each and every such Seller. Purchaser and the Escrow Agent are
entitled to rely upon such decision, act, consent, instruction or action of
the Sellers' Designee as the decision, act, consent, instruction or action of
all Sellers for all purposes hereunder.

(i) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to the Escrow Agent the Adjustment
Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to be held and
distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

Section 2.3 Determination of Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare or shall cause
the Company to prepare and deliver to Sellers' Designee (1) an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of 11:59 p.m. on the Business Day

calculations of (A) the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, (B) the amount of
the Closing Cash, (C) the amount of the Outstanding Company Expenses, (D) the

allocated to the Blocker on the Company's Final Federal Return), (E) the
amount of Closing Working Capital and Target Working Capital, (F) the amount
of the Working Capital Adjustment and (G) the Final Aggregate Cash
Consideration based on such amounts set forth in the Closing Statement, which
statement shall quantify in reasonable detail the calculations of the items
constituting such Closing Indebtedness, such Closing Cash, such Outstanding
Company Expenses, such Company Tax Benefits Amount, such Closing Working
Capital, such Target Working Capital and such Working Capital Adjustment, if
any, and such Final Aggregate Cash Consideration based on such amounts, in
each case calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If
Purchaser fails to timely deliver the Closing Statement in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence within such ninety (90)‑day period, then, at
the election of Sellers' Designee in its sole discretion, either (x) the
Estimated Closing Statement delivered by the Company to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) shall be deemed final for all purposes herein or (y) Sellers'
Designee may dispute the Estimated Closing Statement in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section 2.3(c); provided, however, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers reserve any and all other rights
granted to them in this Agreement. Purchaser shall cause the Company to
provide Sellers and their respective Representatives (including Sellers'
Designee) with full access to the Company's auditors, accounting and other
personnel and to the books and records of the Company, and to any other
document or information reasonably requested by any Seller (including the work
papers of the Company's auditors) necessary to allow Sellers and their
respective Representatives (including Sellers' Designee) to verify the
accuracy of the Closing Balance Sheet and/or Closing Statement or to undertake
the activities contemplated by clause (y) in the immediately preceding
sentence.

(b) In the event that Sellers' Designee does not object to the Closing Balance
Sheet or Closing Statement by written notice of objection (the "Notice of
Objection") delivered to Purchaser within forty‑five (45) days after receipt
of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement by Sellers' Designee,
the calculation of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to the
Closing Statement shall be deemed final and binding. A Notice of Objection
shall set forth in reasonable detail Sellers' Designee's alternative
calculations of (i) the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, (ii) the amount of
the Closing Cash, (iii) the amount of the Outstanding Company Expenses, (iv)
the amount of the Company Tax Benefits Amount (which shall be calculated based
on the amount of the Company Expenses that are not Outstanding Company
Expenses, Sellers' Designee's good faith estimate of the amount of Outstanding
Company Expenses, and the net taxable income and deductible Company Expenses
allocated to the Blocker on the Company's Final Federal Return), (v) the
Closing Working Capital, the Target Working Capital and the Working Capital
Adjustment calculated by reference thereto and (vi) the Final Aggregate Cash
Consideration based on such amounts, in each case calculated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) If Sellers' Designee delivers a Notice of Objection to Purchaser within
the forty‑five (45) day period referred to in Section 2.3(b), then any element
of the Closing Statement 

that is not in dispute on the date such Notice of Objection is given shall be
treated as final and binding and any dispute (all such disputed amounts, the
"Disputed Amounts") shall be resolved as follows:

(i) Sellers' Designee and Purchaser shall promptly endeavor in good faith to
resolve the Disputed Amounts listed in the Notice of Objection. In the event
that a written agreement determining the Disputed Amounts has not been reached
within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as may be agreed by
Sellers' Designee and Purchaser) after the date of receipt by Purchaser from
Sellers' Designee of the Notice of Objection, the resolution of such Disputed
Amounts shall be submitted to McGladrey LLP (or its successor operating under
the name "RSM") or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to serve as the
Neutral Referee, such other independent accountant of national standing to
which Purchaser and Sellers' Designee shall mutually agree in writing (the
"Neutral Referee"). If one or more Disputed Amounts are submitted to the
Neutral Referee for resolution, Purchaser and Sellers' Designee shall enter
into a customary engagement letter with, and to the extent necessary each
party to this Agreement will waive and cause its controlled Affiliates to
waive any conflicts with, the Neutral Referee at the time such dispute is
submitted to the Neutral Referee and shall cooperate with the Neutral Referee
in connection with its determination pursuant to this Section 2.3. Within ten
(10) Business Days after the Neutral Referee has been retained, each of
Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers' Designee, on the other hand, shall
furnish, at their own expense to the Neutral Referee and substantially
simultaneously to the other a written statement of its position with respect
to each Disputed Amount. Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration of
such ten (10) Business Day period, each of Purchaser and Sellers' Designee may
deliver to the Neutral Referee its response to the other's position on each
Disputed Amount; provided, that each delivers a copy thereof substantially
simultaneously to the other. With each submission, each of Purchaser and
Sellers' Designee may also furnish to the Neutral Referee such other
information and documents as each deems relevant or such information and
documents as may be requested by the Neutral Referee; provided that each
delivers a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. The Neutral
Referee may, at its discretion, conduct one or more conferences (whether in
person or by teleconference) concerning the Disputed Amounts and each of
Purchaser and Sellers' Designee shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to have present its
Representatives at such conferences;

(ii) Sellers' Designee and Purchaser shall instruct the Neutral Referee to
promptly (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days of the submission
of the Disputed Amounts to the Neutral Referee) render a decision in
accordance with this Section 2.3(c) along with a written statement delivered
to each of Purchaser and Sellers' Designee, which shall include the Neutral
Referee's (A) determination as to the calculation of each of the Disputed
Amounts and (B) the corresponding corrective calculations set forth in the 

Closing Statement that are derived from its determination as to the
calculations of the Disputed Amounts. Absent manifest error, the decision of
the Neutral Referee shall be final and binding upon each party hereto and the
decision of the Neutral Referee shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and non‑appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court having jurisdiction thereover;

(iii) the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be recalculated based upon
the final determination (or deemed determination) of the Neutral Referee with
respect to the Disputed Amounts and the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, as
so recalculated, shall be deemed to be final and binding, absent manifest
error;

(iv) in the event Sellers' Designee and Purchaser submit any Disputed Amounts
to the Neutral Referee for resolution, Sellers and Purchaser shall each pay
their own costs and expenses incurred under this Section 2.3(c). The Sellers'
portion of any costs and expenses incurred under this Section 2.3(c) shall be
paid exclusively from the Adjustment Escrow Amount. The Sellers' allocable
portion of costs and expenses under this Section 2.3(c) shall be equal to that
fraction of the fees and costs of the Neutral Referee where (A) the numerator
is the absolute value of the difference between Sellers' aggregate position
with respect to the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration and the Final Aggregate
Cash Consideration as recalculated based upon the Neutral Referee's final
determination with respect to the Disputed Amounts and (B) the denominator is
the absolute value of the difference between Sellers' aggregate position with
respect to the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration and Purchaser's aggregate
position with respect to the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, and Purchaser
shall be responsible for the remainder of such fees and costs; and

(v) the Neutral Referee shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator to
determine, based upon the provisions of this Section 2.3(c), only the Disputed
Amounts and the determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(a). The
Neutral Referee shall only decide the specific items under dispute by the
parties and if (A) the Neutral Referee's determination of any Disputed Amount
is less than the lesser of the amounts claimed by Sellers' Designee and
Purchaser, then such disputed amount shall be deemed to be the lesser of the
amounts claimed by Sellers' Designee and Purchaser or (B) the Neutral
Referee's determination of any Disputed Amount is more than the greater of the
amounts claimed by either Sellers' Designee or Purchaser, then such disputed
amount shall be deemed to be the greater of the amounts claimed by either
Sellers' Designee or Purchaser.

(d) Upon the determination, in accordance with Section 2.3(b) or Section
2.3(c), of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, Sellers' Designee and
Purchaser shall cause the Escrow 

Agent to or Purchaser shall, as the case may be, make the payment(s) required
by this Section 2.3(d). The amount payable from the Adjustment Escrow Amount
or by Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) is referred to herein as the
"Purchase Price Adjustment".

(i) If the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration is greater than the Estimated
Aggregate Cash Consideration, then Purchaser shall pay to Sellers' Designee on
behalf of and for delivery to the Sellers an amount in cash equal to the
aggregate difference between the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration and the
Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration within three (3) Business Days of the
determination of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, such amounts to be
paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated
by Sellers' Designee pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Further, Purchaser and
Sellers' Designee shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately
release to Sellers' Designee the remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, if any (after giving effect to any distributions pursuant to Section
2.3(c)(iv)).

(ii) If the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Cash Consideration, then within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, Purchaser and
Sellers' Designee shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to immediately
release (A) to Purchaser from the Adjustment Escrow Amount an amount equal to
the amount by which the Estimated Aggregate Cash Consideration exceeds the
Final Aggregate Cash Consideration (the "Seller Adjustment Payment"), and (B)
to Sellers' Designee, on behalf of and for delivery to each Seller, the
remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow Amount, if any (after giving effect
to the distributions in Section 2.3(c)(iv) and in clause (A)). The Seller
Adjustment Payment shall be paid exclusively from the Adjustment Escrow Amount
and in the event that the remaining balance of the Adjustment Escrow Amount
(after giving effect to the distribution in Section 2.3(c)(iv) and immediately
prior to the distribution in clause (A)) is less than the Seller Adjustment
Payment, the distribution of such remaining balance from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount shall be deemed to satisfy in full Sellers' obligation to deliver the
Seller Adjustment Payment and Purchaser shall have no recourse against any
Seller with respect to any such deficiency.

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Sellers to Purchaser
(the "Seller Disclosure Letter") in connection with this Agreement, each
Seller, severally as to itself only, and not jointly or jointly and severally,
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date of this Agreement

partnership, duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and such Seller has all requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on

(b) Such Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each jurisdiction in which the
character or location of the properties it owns, leases or operates or the
nature of the business it conducts makes such qualification, license or good
standing (or the equivalent thereof) necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing (or the
equivalent thereof) would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the ability of such Seller to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

Section 3.2 Authorization; Noncontravention.

(a) Such Seller has the requisite power and authority and has taken all action
necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by such Seller as contemplated hereby and thereby,
to perform such Seller's obligations hereunder and thereunder and to

the Sellers shall have the power and authority to cause the sale and transfer
or any Blocker Units or Company Units held by a Person that is not a Seller.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Seller, and
the consummation by such Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby, have
been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate or other action.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Seller and,
assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
Purchaser, the Blocker, the Company and each other Seller, constitutes a valid
and binding obligation of such Seller enforceable against such Seller in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
and by general equitable principles.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by such Seller as contemplated hereby do not, and
the consummation 

of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by such Seller or any
holder of Company Units or Blocker Units that is not a Seller will not, (i)
conflict with any of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation, operating agreement, by‑laws or other equivalent
charter documents, as amended, of such Seller or any such holder, (ii)
conflict with or result in a breach of, or default under, any Contract to
which such Seller or any such holder is a party or by which any of its assets
or properties are bound or (iii) subject to any consents, approvals,

Contract with any Person to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or acquire
rights in any of such Seller's Units.

(b) Such Seller has (and, as of the Closing, such Seller or an Affiliate
thereof will have) good and valid title to all of the Units set forth next to
such Seller's name in Section 3.3 of the Seller Disclosure Letter and such
Units are beneficially and of record owned by such Seller or such Affiliate,
free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens arising under applicable
securities Laws or under the Credit Agreements. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will convey to Purchaser good
title to all of the equity interests of Blocker and (directly and through the
Blocker) the Company, including the Units set forth next to such Seller's name
in Section 3.3 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, free and clear of all Liens,
except for those created by Purchaser or arising out of ownership of the Units

individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
ability of such Seller or any such holder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 3.7 Investment Intent.

(a) Such Seller and each Seller Recipient that is not a Seller is acquiring
the Purchaser Common Stock for its own account, for investment purposes only,
not as a nominee or agent, and not with a view toward, or for sale in

and equity interests of companies such as the ones being transferred pursuant
to this Agreement, and such Seller and any Seller Recipient that is not a
Seller can bear the economic risk of its investment and has such knowledge and
experience in financial or business matters that such Seller and each Seller
Recipient that is not a Seller is capable of evaluating the merits and risks
of its investment in the Purchaser Common Stock to be acquired by it pursuant
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Such Seller and each Seller Recipient that is not a Seller understands

otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any
other provision of applicable state securities Laws or pursuant to an
applicable exemption therefrom.

that is not a Seller has conducted to its satisfaction its own independent
investigation, verification, review and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, Liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, technology
and prospects of the Purchaser, which investigation, verification, review and
analysis was conducted by such Seller, each Seller Recipient that is not a
Seller and their respective Affiliates and, to the extent such Seller or
Seller Representative deemed appropriate, by such Seller's or Seller
Recipient's Representatives. Such Seller acknowledges, on behalf of itself and
each Seller Recipient that is not a Seller, that it and its Representatives
have been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises and
records of the Purchaser for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement,
such Seller acknowledges, on behalf of itself and each Seller Recipient that

and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in ARTICLE VI), and such Seller
acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and each Seller Recipient that is
not a Seller and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that:

members, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors or
Representatives makes or has made any oral or written representation or
warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of (i)
any of the information set forth in any presentations relating to the
Purchaser made available to such Seller, such Seller Recipients or their

by the management of the Purchaser, in "break out" discussions, in responses
to questions submitted by or on behalf of such Seller, such Seller Recipients
or their respective Affiliates or Representatives, whether orally or in
writing, in materials prepared by or on behalf of the Purchaser, or in any
other 

form, or (ii) any information delivered or made available pursuant to this
Agreement (such information, collectively, "Purchaser Due Diligence
Materials"), or (iii) any pro forma financial information, projections or

made available, or statements made (including set forth in management
summaries relating to the Purchaser provided to such Seller or such Seller
Recipients), in materials made available in any "data room" (virtual or
otherwise), in presentations by the Purchaser's management or otherwise), to
such Seller, such Seller Recipients or their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, advisors, agents or

is a limited liability company duly organized and validly existing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. The Blocker is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each jurisdiction in which
the character or location of the properties it owns, leases or operates or the
nature of the business it conducts makes such qualification, license or good
standing (or the equivalent thereof) necessary, except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing (or the
equivalent 

thereof) would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Blocker has delivered, prior
to the date hereof, to Purchaser a copy of the Blocker Operating Agreement, as
amended and in full force and effect as of the date hereof. The Blocker is not
in violation of any of the provisions of the Blocker Operating Agreement.

Section 4.2 Authorization; Noncontravention.

(a) The Blocker has the requisite limited liability company power and
authority and has taken all limited liability company action necessary to
execute and deliver this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to
be delivered by the Blocker as contemplated hereby and thereby, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Blocker, and
the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
authorized and approved by all necessary limited liability company or other
action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Blocker
and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers, constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Blocker enforceable against the Blocker in accordance with
its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
equitable principles.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by the Blocker as contemplated hereby do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the
Blocker will not, (i) conflict with any of the provisions of the Blocker's
articles of organization, the Blocker Operating Agreement or other equivalent
charter documents, as amended, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of, or
default under, any Contract to which the Blocker is a party or by which any of
its assets or properties are bound or (iii) subject to any consents,
approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and notices required under
any Antitrust Laws, contravene any Law or any Order applicable to the Blocker
or by which any of its properties or assets are bound except, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such consents, approvals, authorizations,
declarations, filings or notices the failure of which to obtain or make, as
applicable, or such conflicts, breaches or defaults which, would not,
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.3 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized equity capitalization of the Blocker consists of
uncertificated limited liability company interests as reflected in the Blocker
Operating Agreement. All of the Blocker Units are issued and outstanding and
owned by the Blocker Sellers and are evidenced solely by the Blocker Operating
Agreement. The capitalization of the Blocker, as of the date hereof, is 

set forth in Section 4.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. As of the
completion of the Internal Restructuring and immediately prior to the Closing,
the Blocker Sellers will, together, directly or indirectly own and have voting
control over all of the Blocker Units, which will be evidenced solely by the
Blocker Operating Agreement. All Blocker Units have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, were issued in compliance
with all applicable federal and state securities Laws and are not subject to
any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar rights that have not
been waived. Except for the Blocker Units set forth in in Section 4.3(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, no limited liability company interests or other
equity interests or securities of the Blocker were reserved for issuance. The
Blocker is not a party to any option, warrant, call, subscription or other
right (including any preemptive right), agreement or commitment which is
outstanding and in effect (and has not been waived) and obligates it to issue,
sell or transfer, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any of the
limited liability company interests or other equity interests or security in
the Blocker. The Blocker has no obligation (contingent or otherwise) which is
outstanding and in effect (and has not been waived) to (i) issue any such
option, warrant, call, subscription or other right (including any preemptive
right), agreement or commitment, (ii) issue or distribute to holders of any
limited liability company interests or other equity interests or securities in
the Blocker any evidence of Indebtedness or asset of the Blocker or (iii) pay
any dividend or make any other distribution in respect of any partnership
interests, limited liability company interests or other equity interests in
the Blocker. There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings
in effect to which the Blocker is a party with respect to the voting of any
limited liability company interests or equivalent equity interests or
securities of the Blocker. The Blocker does not have any outstanding bonds,
debentures or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote
(or are convertible or exchangeable for securities having the right to vote)
with the Blocker Sellers or any Affiliates thereof on any matter.

(b) As of the date hereof, the Blocker owns no equity interests in any Person
other than the Promote Vehicle and the Company Seller, and as of immediately
prior to the Closing the Blocker will own no equity interests in any Person
other than the Company.

Section 4.4 Consents and Approvals. Assuming (i) all filings required under
the Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, (ii) the filing of applications and notices, as
applicable, with the NYSE, (iii) all filings and approvals required to be made
or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" Laws of various states in
connection with the issuance of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement are made, and (iv) the accuracy of the representations set
forth in Section 6.4, no consent of or filing with any Governmental Entity,
which has not been received or made, is necessary or required with respect to
the Blocker in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Blocker or the consummation by the Blocker of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except for any other consents or filings which
if not made or obtained, would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 4.5 Compliance with Laws. (a) The operations of the Blocker have been
conducted in compliance with Law and any applicable Order in all material
respects, and (b) except as set forth in Section 4.5 of the Company Disclosure
Letter or in any supplement thereto provided pursuant to Section 7.10(b) (it
being understood that the only supplement contemplated by this clause (b) for
purposes of Section 7.10(b) shall be with respect to notices and not any
noncompliance with any applicable Law), the Blocker has not received any
written notice with respect to any material failure to comply with any
provision of applicable Law.

Section 4.6 Litigation. Except as set forth in Section 4.6 of the Company
Disclosure Letter or in any supplement thereto provided pursuant to Section
7.10(b), (a) there is no Action pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Blocker,
threatened in writing, against the Blocker (other than such Actions which, if
determined adversely to the Blocker, would not reasonably be expected to
result, individually or in the aggregate, in Liabilities to the Blocker in the
excess of $300,000 or any non-monetary remedies), and (b) to the Knowledge of
the Blocker, there are no audits or investigations by a Governmental Entity
pending or threatened against the Blocker.

Section 4.7 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Returns. The Blocker has properly filed or caused to be filed on a
timely basis (taking into account any applicable extension of time within
which to file) all material Tax Returns that are required to be filed by, or
with respect to, the Blocker, and all such Tax Returns are correct and
complete in all material respects.

(b) Payment of Taxes. The Blocker has paid on a timely basis all material
Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, of the Blocker that are due and
payable. The unpaid Taxes of the Blocker (A) for taxable periods through the
Most Recent Balance Sheet Date do not exceed the accruals and reserves for
Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for deferred Taxes established to
reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the books
and records of the Blocker and (B) for taxable periods through the Closing
Date, will not exceed the reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through
the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP. All unpaid Taxes of the Blocker for
all taxable periods commencing after the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date arose
in the Ordinary Course of Business.

(c) Other Tax Matters.

(i) The Blocker is not currently the subject of an audit or other examination
relating to any Tax Return or the payment of Taxes of the Blocker by any
Governmental Entity nor has the Blocker received any written notices from any
Governmental Entity that such an audit or examination is contemplated or
pending. No deficiencies for Taxes of the Blocker have been claimed, proposed
or assessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Blocker, otherwise by any
Governmental Entity. The Blocker 

has not been informed in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Blocker,
otherwise by any jurisdiction in which the Blocker does not file a Tax Return
that the jurisdiction believes that the Blocker was required to file any Tax
Return that was not filed or is subject to Tax in such jurisdiction.

(ii) The Blocker (A) has not entered into a written agreement or waiver
extending any statute of limitations relating to the payment or collection of
any Taxes of the Blocker that has not expired, (B) requested any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has not yet been
filed, or (C) executed or filed any power of attorney with any Governmental
Entity, which is still in effect. The Blocker is not contesting any Tax
Liability of the Blocker before any Governmental Entity.

(iii) The Blocker is not and has never been a member of an affiliated group
with which it has filed (or been required to file) consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar Tax Returns. The Blocker does not have any liability under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or similar provision
of federal, state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor,
pursuant to any contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any
Person.

(iv) All material Taxes that the Blocker is (or was) required by Law to
withhold or collect in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, member or other third party

ARTICLE V 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Purchaser (the "Company Disclosure Letter") in connection with this Agreement,
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing as follows:

Section 5.1 Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power. The Company
is a limited liability company duly organized and validly existing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted. Each Subsidiary of the Company (together, the "Company
Subsidiaries") is set forth in Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter
and is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or formation and each has all requisite power (corporate or
otherwise) and authority to own, lease and operate its 

properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company
and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the properties it owns,
leases or operates or the nature of the business it conducts makes such
qualification, license or good standing (or the equivalent thereof) necessary,
except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed
and in good standing (or the equivalent thereof) would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered, prior to the date hereof, to Purchaser a
copy of the Company Operating Agreement, as amended and in full force and
effect as of the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of any of the
provisions of the Company Operating Agreement.

Section 5.2 Authorization; Noncontravention.

(a) The Company has the requisite limited liability company power and
authority and has taken all limited liability company action necessary to
execute and deliver this Agreement and all other instruments and agreements to
be delivered by the Company as contemplated hereby and thereby, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by the Company, and the consummation by it of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary
limited liability company or other action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, the Blocker and the
Sellers, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
its enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and all other instruments and
agreements to be delivered by the Company as contemplated hereby do not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the
Company will not, (i) conflict with any of the provisions of the Company's
articles of organization, the Company Operating Agreement or other equivalent
organizational documents, as amended, (ii) subject to any consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings and notices required under any Antitrust
Laws, contravene any Law or any Order applicable to the Company or by which
any of its properties or assets are bound, or (iii) subject to the consents,
approvals, authorizations, declarations, filings and notices set forth in
Section 5.2(b) or Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter, conflict with
or result in a breach of, or default under, any Material Contract, except, in
the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for such consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings or notices the failure of which to
obtain or make, as applicable, or such conflicts, breaches or defaults which,
would not, reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. 

Section 5.3 Capitalization.

(a) As of the date hereof, the authorized equity capitalization of the Company
consists of uncertificated limited liability company interests as reflected in
the Company Operating Agreement. At the close of business on the date hereof,
all of the Company Units are issued and outstanding and owned by the Company
Seller. As of the completion of the Internal Restructuring and immediately
prior to the Closing, the Company Seller, the GP Seller and the Blocker will,
together, directly or indirectly, own and have voting control over all of the
issued and outstanding Company Units, which will be evidenced solely by the
Company Operating Agreement. The capitalization of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof is set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and there will be no changes to such capitalization
as of the Closing other than those permitted under this Agreement to effect
the Internal Restructuring. All Company Units and all issued and outstanding
limited liability company interests or shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, were
issued in compliance with all applicable federal and state securities Laws and
are not subject to any preemptive rights, rights of first refusal or similar
rights. Except as set forth in this Agreement or in Section 5.3(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, no limited liability company interests or other
equity interests or securities of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries were
reserved for issuance. Except as described in this Section 5.3 and as set
forth in Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any outstanding option,
warrant, call, subscription or other right (including any preemptive right),
agreement or commitment which obligates any of them to issue, sell or
transfer, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any of the limited
liability company interests or other equity interest or security in the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as described in this Section 5.3 or
as set forth in Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation (contingent or
otherwise) to (i) issue any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other
right (including any preemptive right), agreement or commitment, (ii) issue or
distribute to holders of any limited liability company interests or other
equity interests or securities in the Company or any Company Subsidiary any
evidence of Indebtedness or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
(iii) pay any dividend or make any other distribution in respect of any
limited liability company interests or other equity interests or securities in
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party with respect to the voting of any limited liability company interests
or equivalent equity interests or securities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any outstanding
bonds, debentures or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or are convertible or exchangeable for securities having the right to
vote) with Sellers, Affiliates thereof or any equityholders of any Company
Subsidiary on any matter. 

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns any equity interest
(other than equity interests in the Company Subsidiaries) in any Person.

the Antitrust Laws are made and any waiting periods thereunder have been
terminated or expired, (ii) the filing of applications and notices, as
applicable, with the NYSE, (iii) all filings and approvals required to be made
or obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" Laws of various states in
connection with the issuance of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement are made, and (iv) the accuracy of the representations set
forth in Section 6.4, no consent of or filing with any Governmental Entity,
which has not been received or made, is necessary or required with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for (a) the
consents or filings set forth in Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter
and (b) any other consents or filings which, if not made or obtained, would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.5 Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) The Company has made available to Purchaser (i) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of Mustang Holdings and the other Company Subsidiaries and the
related audited consolidated statements of operations, members' equity and
cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 (the "Balance Sheet
Date") and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Mustang Holdings
and the other Company Subsidiaries and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of operations, members' equity and cash flows for the eight months

and the date thereof, the "Most Recent Balance Sheet Date") (such financial
statements (including the footnotes thereto) in clauses (i) and (ii),
collectively, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except (x) as otherwise described therein or
in Section 5.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (y) in the case of
unaudited Financial Statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments (the
effect of which would not be material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole) and the absence of footnotes.

(b) The balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5(a)(i) fairly presents, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mustang Holdings and
the other Company Subsidiaries, as of the Balance Sheet Date, and the related
statements of operations, members' equity and cash flows fairly present, in
all material respects, the consolidated results of the operations, members'
equity and cash flows of Mustang Holdings and the other Company Subsidiaries
for the period ended on the Balance Sheet Date. The unaudited consolidated
balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5(a)(ii) fairly presents, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of

and cash flows fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
results of the operations, members' equity and cash flows of Mustang Holdings
and the other Company Subsidiaries for the period then ended.

Liabilities that are required to be set forth in an audited consolidated
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for Liabilities (i)
reflected on the Financial Statements, (ii) incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date or which would be included
in Closing Working Capital or Company Expenses, (iii) in connection with
existing executory Contracts (other than on account of a default thereunder)
that are not required by GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet and that are
not in the aggregate material, (iv) that would not reasonably be expected to
be individually or in the aggregate, material to the Blocker, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), (v) incurred after the date
hereof in accordance with Section 7.3 or (vi) incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Except for obligations under the Company Operating Agreement, this
Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement, the Company (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Subsidiaries) has neither incurred any
obligation or liability nor engaged in any business or activity of any type or
kind whatsoever, other than its direct ownership of equity interests in
Mustang Holdings (and any activities related thereto and the exercise of
rights appurtenant thereto).

(e) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP.

Section 5.7 Compliance with Laws. Since October 18, 2013, (a) the businesses
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance
with Law and any applicable Order in all material respects and (b) except as
set forth in Section 5.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter or in any supplement
thereto provided pursuant to Section 7.10(b) (it being understood that the
only supplement contemplated by this clause (b) for purposes of Section
7.10(b) shall be with respect to notices and not any noncompliance with any
applicable Law or Order) 

neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice
from a Governmental Entity with respect to any material failure to comply with
any provision of applicable Law or Order. Except as set forth in Section 5.7
of the Company Disclosure Letter or in any supplement thereto provided
pursuant to Section 7.10(b) (it being understood that the only supplement
contemplated by this sentence for purposes of Section 7.10(b) shall be with
respect to the issuance of Orders and not any noncompliance with any
applicable Law), none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any of the officers, directors or key employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party to or is named as subject to
the provisions of any Order (in the case of officers, directors or key
employees, solely such as would affect the Company or any Company Subsidiary).
None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any of the officers, directors or key employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or
memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or
similar undertaking from, any Governmental Entity having or claiming
jurisdiction over the Company or any Company Subsidiary, that currently

or any Company Subsidiary, nor is any such Order, action, agreement,
memorandum, letter or undertaking, to the Knowledge of the Company,

the business of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries as presently
conducted, or that are necessary for the lawful ownership of their respective
properties and assets, except to the extent that the failure to hold any such
Permits would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (taken as a whole). Since October 18, 2013, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with the terms and
requirements of each Permit that is material to the businesses of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole), are not in default in any

purposes of Section 7.10(b) shall be with respect to the receipt of written
communications and not any failure to hold a Permit required for the operation
of the business of the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries), neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written communication from
a Governmental Entity alleging that a Permit not currently held by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary is necessary for the operation of the business of the

threatened in writing, against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or, solely with respect to such Person's capacity as such, any director,
manager, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
(other than such Actions which, if determined adversely to the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, would not reasonably be expected to result,
individually or together with all other Actions arising from similar facts or
practices, in Liabilities to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
the excess of $300,000 or any material non-monetary remedies), (b) there is no

meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), together with plans or arrangements that would be

section or (ii) individually negotiated or applicable only to one person, and
each material bonus, incentive, equity based compensation, deferred
compensation and fringe benefit plan, severance pay, stay or retention bonuses
or compensation, change in control payments or benefits, sick leave, vacation
pay, disability pay, retirement benefits, hospitalization, medical or
disability benefits (whether insured or self-insured), life insurance, tuition
reimbursement, and any plans subject to Section 125 of the Code maintained by
the Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or to which the Company
and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries contributes (or has an obligation to
contribute) or is a party or for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has any Liability (directly or through any ERISA Affiliate) is listed in
Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter (collectively with any such
plans and arrangements not sufficiently material to be listed, the "Employee
Benefit Plans"). No Employee Benefit Plan is covered by Title IV of ERISA.
Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in
the aggregate, a material liability to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries: (i) each Employee Benefit Plan is and has been in compliance
with applicable Law and has been administered and operated in all respects in
accordance with its terms; (ii) neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other "disqualified 

person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code
and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively) has engaged in any transactions in
connection with any Employee Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
result in the imposition of a penalty pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a
Tax pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code; and (iii) no Action or investigation
by a Governmental Entity (including the IRS and the Department of Labor) has
been made, commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims
for benefits payable in the Ordinary Course of Business, and appeals of such
denied claims). Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") or is comprised of a master or prototype plan that has received a
favorable opinion letter from the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred and no condition exists which would reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation of any such determination letter or
opinion letter. No Employee Benefit Plan provides for post-employment or
retiree health, life insurance or other welfare benefits, except as required
by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or
any similar state law. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
unfunded liabilities pursuant to any Employee Benefit Plan which is an
"employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA)
that is not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred material penalties under
Section 4980H of the Code. No Employee Benefit Plan contains any provision
that, as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in
connection with any related, concurrent, or subsequent employment
termination), would (i) increase, accelerate or vest any compensation or
benefit, (ii) require severance, termination or retention payments, (iii)
forgive any indebtedness, (iv) result in the payment of any "excess parachute
payment" under Section 280G of the Code, or (v) promise or provide any tax
gross ups or tax indemnification under Sections 280G or 409A of the Code. The
Company has made available to Purchaser or its counsel true and complete
copies of each Employee Benefit Plan, together with all amendments thereto

all employee booklets, summary plan descriptions and any summaries of material
modifications; (ii) all trust agreements; (iii) the most recently filed annual
report on IRS Form 5500 series, including any attachments thereto; and (iv)
the most recent determination letter and/or opinion letter.

Section 5.11 Labor Matters.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to a
collective bargaining agreement with any labor union. Within the two (2) year
period immediately prior to the date hereof, no labor union has made a demand

or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and there are and have been no
representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing to be brought or filed with 

the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor Governmental Entity with
respect to the employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.
There are no presently pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
in writing strikes, lockouts, work stoppages or collective labor disputes
affecting the employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a material liability to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with
all applicable Laws relating to labor or employment relations or practices,
terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, including any such Law

(whether for purposes of overtime or employee/independent contractor status or
otherwise), workers' compensation, family and medical leave, the Immigration
Reform and Control Act and other applicable immigration Laws and occupational
safety and health requirements and with their employment or other service

expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material liability
to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, no Actions are pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, with respect to such Laws, either by
private individuals or by Governmental Entities.

(c) Since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
caused (1) a plant closing as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq. (the "WARN Act"), as
amended, or any similar Law affecting any site of employment or one or more
operating units within any site of employment of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (1) a mass layoff as defined in the WARN Act or any similar Law.

Section 5.12 Tax Matters.

(a) Tax Returns. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has properly
filed or caused to be filed on a timely basis (taking into account any

that are required to be filed by, or with respect to, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and all such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all
material respects.

(b) Payment of Taxes. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have paid on a
timely basis all material Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, of

through the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date do not materially exceed the
accruals and reserves for Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
set forth on the Financial Statements and (B) for taxable periods through the
Closing Date, will not exceed the 

reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in

subject of an audit or other examination relating to any Tax Return or the
payment of Taxes of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries by any
Governmental Entity nor have the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
received any written notices from any Governmental Entity that such an audit
or examination is contemplated or pending. No deficiencies for material Taxes
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been claimed, proposed, assessed
or reassessed in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise by any
Governmental Entity. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
has been informed in writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise by

not file a Tax Return that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed or
is subject to Tax in such jurisdiction.

Section 6.5 Purchaser Filed SEC Documents; Financial Statements; No
Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal Controls.

(a) Since January 1, 2012, Purchaser has timely filed or received the
appropriate extension of time within which to file all reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents with the SEC required to be filed by
Purchaser (the "Purchaser Filed SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates
of filing or, in the case of a registration statement under the Securities
Act, as of the date such registration statement is declared effective by the
SEC, or, if amended (or deemed amended), as of the date of the last amendment
or deemed amendment prior to the date hereof, the Purchaser Filed SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, as
applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder
applicable thereto. None of the Purchaser Filed SEC Documents, including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by 

reference therein, at the time filed or transmitted (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment
or superseding filing prior to the date hereof) contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Purchaser has made
available to the Company copies of all comment letters received by Purchaser
from the SEC since January 1, 2012 and relating to the Purchaser Filed SEC
Documents, together with all written responses of Purchaser thereto, to the
extent that such comment letters and written responses are not publicly
available on EDGAR. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding
or unresolved comments in such comment letters received by Purchaser from the
SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, none of
the Purchaser Filed SEC Documents is the subject of any ongoing review by the
SEC. No principal executive officer or principal financial officer of
Purchaser has failed to make the certifications required of him or her under
Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act with respect to the applicable
Purchaser Filed SEC Documents. None of Purchaser's Subsidiaries is, or since
January 1, 2012 has been, required to file periodic reports with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act other than as part of Purchaser's consolidated
group.

(b) The financial statements of Purchaser and Subsidiaries of Purchaser
included (or incorporated by reference) in the Purchaser Filed SEC Documents
(including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from,
and are in accordance with, the books and records of Purchaser and
Subsidiaries of Purchaser; (ii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated income, cash flows, changes in stockholders' equity and
consolidated financial position of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to recurring year‑end
audit adjustments normal in nature and amount and the absence of footnotes and
subject to restatements filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement) and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (consistently
applied during the period involved), except, in each case, as otherwise
described therein or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC. As of the date hereof, Deloitte and Touche LLP has not
resigned (or informed Purchaser that it intends to resign) or been dismissed
as independent public accountants of Purchaser as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with Purchaser on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(c) Purchaser and its Subsidiaries do not have any Liabilities that are
required to be set forth in an audited consolidated balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for Liabilities (i) reflected on the consolidated
balance sheet of Purchaser included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarterly period ended March 31, 2015 (including any notes thereto), (ii)
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since March 31, 2015, (iii) in connection with existing executory Contracts,
(iv) that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect or (v) incurred in 

connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. None of Purchaser or any
Subsidiaries of Purchaser is a party to any material "off-balance sheet
arrangements" as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

(d) Purchaser maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Purchaser (x) has implemented
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a‑15(e)
of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Purchaser, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Purchaser by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Purchaser's outside
auditors and the audit committee of Purchaser's Board of Directors (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a‑15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Purchaser's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Purchaser's internal controls over
financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, as of the date hereof,
there are no facts that would reasonably be expected to prevent Purchaser's
outside auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial officer from
giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, without
qualification, when required.

Section 6.6 Broker's or Finder's Fee. No agent, broker, Person or firm acting
on behalf of Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser is, or shall be,
entitled to any fee, commission or broker's or finder's fees in connection
with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby from any of
the other parties hereto or from any Affiliate of the other parties hereto.

Section 6.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2014
there has not occurred a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. During the period
from December 31, 2014 to the date hereof, (a) other than in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the businesses of Purchaser and each of the
Subsidiaries of Purchaser have been conducted in all material respects in the
Ordinary Course of Business and (b) Purchaser has not taken any action or
event that would have required the Company's consent pursuant to Section 7.4.

Section 6.8 Financing. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Purchaser has delivered to the Company and each Seller true, correct and
complete copies of the duly executed debt commitment letter(s) and each
executed fee letter associated therewith (provided, that 

provisions in such fee letter(s) related solely to fees, "flex" terms and
economic terms (other than covenants) agreed to by the parties may be redacted
(none of which redacted provisions adversely affect the availability of, or
impose additional restrictions on the availability of, the Debt Financing at
the Closing)), dated as of the date hereof (such commitment letter(s),
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments thereto
and each such fee letter, collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter(s)"), from
Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch"), SunTrust Bank ("SunTrust"), SunTrust
Robinson Humphrey, Inc. ("STRH") and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. ("MUFG" and,
together with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, SunTrust and STRH, collectively,
the "Debt Financing Source(s)" providing the terms and conditions upon which
the Debt Financing Source(s) have committed to provide debt financing (the
"Debt Financing") up to $2,125,000,000. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Commitment Letter(s) in the form so delivered is, as to Purchaser and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto, valid, binding and
enforceable (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and to general principles of equity) obligations and in full
force and effect, such commitments have not been withdrawn, terminated,
rescinded or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, no such withdrawal,
termination, rescission, amendment or modification is contemplated or pending,
and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default, breach or
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other Person, under any
term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter(s). The Debt Commitment
Letter(s) (together with the fee letter(s) referred to therein) constitute the
entire and complete agreement between the parties thereto with respect to the
Debt Financing and there are not, and there are not contemplated to be, any
side letters or other contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Financing
other than those expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) and this
Agreement, and, except as set forth, described or provided for in the Debt
Commitment Letter(s), (i) there are no conditions precedent to the respective
obligations of the Debt Financing Source(s) to provide the full amount of the
Debt Financing, and (ii) there are no contractual contingencies or other
provisions under any agreement (including any side letters) relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which Purchaser is a party that
would permit the Debt Financing Source(s) to reduce the total amount of the
Debt Financing, respectively, or impose any additional conditions precedent to
the availability of the Debt Financing. Purchaser has fully paid any and all
commitment fees, if any, or other fees required by the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) to be paid as of the date hereof, and will pay in full any such
amounts due on or before the Closing Date, and Purchaser is unaware of any
fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that would reasonably be
expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter(s) inaccurate or that would reasonably be expected
to cause the Debt Commitment Letter(s) to be ineffective. Assuming the
conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 are satisfied at Closing,
Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the terms or 

conditions to the Debt Financing shall not be satisfied on a timely basis or
that the funding contemplated in the Debt Financing shall not be made
available to Purchaser on a timely basis in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At the time of Closing, assuming
the Debt Financing is funded, Purchaser shall have sufficient available funds
to pay the Final Aggregate Cash Consideration, the Payoff Indebtedness, the
Company Expenses and all other amounts to be paid or repaid by Purchaser under
this Agreement (whether payable on or after the Closing) and all of
Purchaser's and its Affiliates' fees and expenses associated with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof. Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that the obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement are not contingent or conditioned in any manner
or to any extent on the availability to Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of any
financing (including, any Debt Financing for, or related to, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement).

Section 6.9 Solvency. Purchaser is not entering the transactions contemplated
hereby with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. Immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties set forth in ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV and
ARTICLE V, the Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall be
Solvent and shall have adequate capital to carry on their respective
businesses.

Section 6.10 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no Action pending,
or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, threatened in writing, against Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than such Actions which, if determined
adversely to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, would not reasonably be
expected to result, individually or together with all other Actions arising
from similar facts or practices, in Liabilities to Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries in excess of $300,000 or any material non-monetary remedies). As
of the date hereof, (a) there is no pending Action and no Person has
threatened to commence any Action against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
that challenges, or that would have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal or otherwise interfering with, any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) there are no Orders outstanding against Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, as of the date hereof,
there are no audits or investigations by a Governmental Entity pending or
threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date
hereof, there is no action by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries pending, or
which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries has commenced preparations to
initiate, against any other Person.

Section 6.11 Compliance with Laws. Since October 18, 2013, (a) The businesses
of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have been conducted in compliance with Law
and any applicable Order in all material respects and (b) neither Purchaser
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from a
Governmental Entity with respect to any material failure to comply with any
provision of applicable Law or Order. 

Section 6.12 Investment Intent.

(a) Purchaser is acquiring the Blocker Units and the Company Units for its own
account, for investment purposes only, not as a nominee or agent, and not with
a view toward, or for sale in connection with, any distribution thereof, nor
with any present intention of distributions or selling the Blocker Units or
the Company Units, in violation of the federal securities Laws or any
applicable foreign or state securities Law. Purchaser does not presently have
any contract, undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any Person to sell,
transfer or grant participations to the Person, with respect to any of the
Blocker Units or the Company Units.

(b) Purchaser qualifies as an "accredited investor," as such term is defined
in Rule 501(a) promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act.

(c) Purchaser understands that the acquisition of the Blocker Units and the
Company Units to be acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
involves substantial risk. Purchaser and its officers have experience as an
investor in securities and equity interests of companies such as the ones
being transferred pursuant to this Agreement, and Purchaser can bear the
economic risk of its investment (which may be for an indefinite period) and
has such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that
Purchaser is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in
the Blocker Units and the Company Units to be acquired by it pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Purchaser understands that the Blocker Units and the Company Units to be
acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement have not been registered under the
Securities Act. Purchaser acknowledges that such securities may not be
transferred, sold, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any other
provision of applicable state securities Laws or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom. Purchaser acknowledges that there is no public market for
the Blocker Units and the Company Units and that there can be no assurance
that a public market shall develop.

Section 6.13 Acknowledgment by Purchaser. Purchaser has conducted to its
satisfaction its own independent investigation, verification, review and
analysis of the business, operations, assets, Liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, technology and prospects of the Blocker, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which investigation, verification,
review and analysis was conducted by Purchaser and its Affiliates and, to the
extent Purchaser deemed appropriate, by Purchaser's Representatives. Purchaser
acknowledges that it and its Representatives have been provided adequate
access to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Blocker, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such purpose. In entering into this
Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the
aforementioned investigation, verification, review and analysis and not on any
factual representations, projections, forecasts, opinions or other 

statements of the Sellers, the Blocker, the Company or any of their respective
Representatives (except the specific representations and warranties of Sellers
set forth in ARTICLE III, the specific representations and warranties of the
Blocker set forth in ARTICLE IV and the specific representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in ARTICLE V), and Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that:

(a) none of the Sellers, the Blocker, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or
any of their respective directors, officers, equity holders, members,
employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors or
Representatives makes or has made any oral or written representation or
warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of (i)
any of the information set forth in any presentations relating to the Blocker,
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries made available to Purchaser, its
Affiliates or its Representatives, in materials made available in any "data
room" (virtual or otherwise), including any cost estimates delivered or made
available, financial projections or other projections, in presentations by the
Sellers, management of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, in "break‑out"
discussions, in responses to questions submitted by or on behalf of Purchaser,
its Affiliates or its Representatives, whether orally or in writing, in
materials prepared by or on behalf of the Sellers, the Blocker or the Company,
or in any other form (such information, collectively, "Company Due Diligence
Materials"), or (ii) any information delivered or made available pursuant to
this Agreement, or (iii) the pro‑forma financial information, projections or
other forward‑looking statements of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
in each case in expectation or furtherance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and

(b) none of the Sellers, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, equity holders, members,
Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, advisors, Representatives or any
other Person shall have any Liability or responsibility whatsoever to
Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, agents or Representatives on any basis (including in contract or
tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any
information provided or made available, or statements made (including set
forth in management summaries relating to the Blocker or the Company provided
to Purchaser, in materials made available in any "data room" (virtual or
otherwise), in presentations by the Company's management or otherwise), to
Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, advisors, agents or Representatives (or any omissions therefrom).

Section 6.14 No Prior Agreements. There are no Contracts between Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the management of
the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, as of the date
hereof, that relate in any way to the Company or any Company Subsidiaries or
the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the employment agreements
with the Specified Employee. 

Section 6.15 Exclusivity of Representations. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, it is the explicit intent of the parties hereto, and the
parties hereto hereby agree, that the representations and warranties made by
the Purchaser in this ARTICLE VI (as modified by the Purchaser Disclosure
Letter) are the sole and exclusive representations and warranties made by the
Purchaser, or any other Person with respect to the Purchaser, including its

any certificate, instrument or document delivered pursuant hereto. Purchaser
hereby disclaims any other express or implied, written or oral,
representations or warranties with respect to the Purchaser, the businesses
and assets of Purchaser the Purchaser Common Stock and the transactions

forward‑looking prospects, risks or statements (financial or otherwise) of
Purchaser made, communicated or furnished (orally or in writing) to Sellers or
their Affiliates or their respective Representatives (including any opinion,
information, projection or advice in any management presentation provided to
Sellers and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives, but
excluding any representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement or any
documents contemplated hereby), and Purchaser hereby disclaims all Liability
and responsibility for any such information and statements. It is understood
that any Purchaser Due Diligence Materials made available to Sellers or their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives do not, directly or indirectly,
and shall not be deemed to, directly or indirectly, contain representations or
warranties of Purchaser or its Affiliates or its Representatives or any other
Person.

Closing, Sellers and the management of the Blocker, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions

Company and the Company Subsidiaries and notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no consent of Purchaser shall be required with respect

holding Purchaser Equity Securities or (ii) any cash dividend consistent with

or other reorganization (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, corporate
restructuring activities conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business solely
among wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Purchaser);

substantially all of the assets or equity securities of, or by any other
manner, any Person or other business organization, unit or division, other

to prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(e) authorize in writing any of, or commit or agree in writing to take any of,
the foregoing actions in the foregoing clauses (a) through (e).

Section 7.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. Except as otherwise set forth in Section
7.6 or Section 7.14, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and
to applicable legal requirements, each of Purchaser, the Blocker, the Company
and each Seller shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, and
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the 

transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the satisfaction of the
respective conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII and (ii) obtaining any
consents from third parties that are necessary or desirable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Purchaser, Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to amend or modify any
Contract or pay any fee to any third party for the purpose of obtaining any
consent or waiver of any third party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Without limiting the obligations of the Blocker, the
Company and each Seller pursuant to this Section 7.5 and the representations
and warranties in Section 3.2(b), Section 4.2(b) and Section 5.2(b), Purchaser
acknowledges that, except as contemplated by Section 8.2(d), obtaining
consents or waivers from parties to Contracts which the Blocker, the Company
or a Company Subsidiary is a party is not a condition to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.6 Antitrust Filings; Consents.

(a) Purchaser, the Blocker, the Sellers and the Company, shall: (i) as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement take all actions
necessary to file or cause to be filed the filings required of it or any of
its Affiliates under any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, which filings shall
include a request for early termination of the applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act, and in furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, shall
make all filings of any Notification and Report Form required under the HSR
Act as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed
between Purchaser and the Sellers, the Blocker, and the Company); (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required to obtain the
required consents from Antitrust Authorities, including antitrust clearance
under the HSR Act and under any other Antitrust Law, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to April 18, 2016 (and if the End Date is
extended in accordance with Section 11.1(c), from and after the time the End
Date is extended, prior to the End Date as so extended); and (iii) at the
earliest practicable and advisable date comply with any formal or informal
request for additional information or documentary material received by it or
any of its Affiliates from any Antitrust Authority. Purchaser, the Sellers,
the Blocker and the Company agree to cooperate in all respects and coordinate
and consult with each other in good faith in connection with any positions,
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals taken, made or submitted or to be taken, made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Laws. Each of Purchaser, the Sellers, the Blocker and the Company
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of any written communication
made to or received by any of Purchaser, any Seller, the Blocker or the
Company, as the case may be, from any Antitrust Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, subject to applicable Law, if
practicable, permit the other parties hereto to review in advance any proposed
substantive written communication to any such Antitrust Authority and
incorporate the other parties' 

reasonable comments, not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion with any such Antitrust Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults
with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Antitrust Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend, and
furnish the other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings and
written communications between them and their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand and any such Antitrust Authority or its
respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under
the HSR Act and under any such other applicable laws or regulations; provided,
however, that to the extent any Seller is required to file a Notification and
Report Form required under the HSR Act with respect to its acquisition of
Purchaser Common Stock, the Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of
all filing fees related to any such filing.

(c) Purchaser, the Sellers and the Company shall in good faith consult with
each other and coordinate with respect to the overall strategy relating to the
Antitrust Laws; provided, however, that subject in each case to the other
provisions of this Section 7.6, if there is a difference of opinion as to the
timing of actions under this Section 7.6 or the terms of any timing agreement
with any Antitrust Authority, Purchaser shall be entitled to make the final
decision with respect to such matters of timing after consultation with the
Company and consideration of any comments from the Company and its counsel in
good faith; provided further that in no event shall Purchaser be permitted to
agree with any Antitrust Authority to extend any waiting period beyond the End
Date as then in effect without the prior written consent of the Company.

(d) Purchaser, the Sellers, the Blocker, and the Company shall not, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, take any action
that could reasonably be expected to delay or make more difficult the
obtaining of clearance or expiration of the required waiting periods under the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, including acquiring or
agreeing to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
purchasing in any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation could reasonably be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any consents of any
Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii)
increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv)
otherwise delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

(e) In furtherance of and not in limitation to Section 7.6(a) and this Section
7.6(e), but subject to Section 7.6(g), each of Purchaser, and the Blocker, the
Company, and Sellers, shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required to cause the
expiration or termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws so as to enable the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to occur as promptly as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement (and in any event no later than the End Date then in effect),
including using its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or other
applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(f) Purchaser and the Blocker, the Company and the Sellers, shall, upon
request by the other and subject to applicable laws relating to the sharing of
information, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice,
submission or application made by or on behalf of Purchaser or the Blocker,
the Company and the Sellers, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
provisions of this Section 7.6 to the contrary, (x) materials provided to the
other party pursuant to this Section 7.6 may be redacted (A) to remove
references concerning the valuation of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and
(C) as necessary to address privilege or confidentiality concerns and (y) each
party shall have the right to designate any information provided to the other
party as subject to review by outside counsel only or by a clean team only
pursuant to and in accordance with the Clean Team Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Blocker, the Company
and the Sellers shall not, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
(1) offer to sell, divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to
acquire, or otherwise dispose of, any Subsidiary, operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers or assets of Purchaser, its Affiliates,
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or after the
Closing and regardless as to whether a third-party purchaser must be
identified or approved prior to the Closing (a "Divestiture"), (2) agree or
otherwise commit to undertake a Divestiture, (3) take or commit to take such
other actions that may limit Purchaser's, its Affiliates', the Company's or
the Company Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, one or more of its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines,
customers or assets (a "Restraint"), or (4) enter into any Order, consent
decree or other agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to
offer, negotiate, agree to, effect, commit to, or undertake any Divestiture or
Restraint, or enter into any Order, consent decree or other agreement to
effectuate any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.6.

Section 7.7 Employee Benefits. 

(a) Until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or such shorter period of
employment), Purchaser shall provide or cause the Company and/or the Company
Subsidiaries to provide to each person who is an employee of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (each a "Company
Employee") a salary or wage level, as applicable, at least equal to the salary
or wage level to which the individual was entitled immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement (or as adjusted where permitted under Section
7.3(b)(viii)). Until December 31, 2016 (or such shorter period of employment),
Purchaser shall provide to each Company Employee (i) a target annual cash
bonus opportunity (excluding equity compensation) at least equal to the target
annual cash bonus opportunity (excluding equity compensation) to which he or
she was entitled immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (or as
adjusted where permitted under Section 7.3(b)(viii)), and, with respect to
each Company Employee in the United States (collectively, the "U.S. Company
Employees"), (ii) generally applicable employee benefit plans that, in the
aggregate, are at least as favorable as the generally applicable employee
benefit plans available to such U.S. Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, provided that coverage subject to the Affordable Care Act may be
excepted from the comparison if and solely to the extent changes are required
for compliance with applicable Law. In addition, Purchaser or the Company
shall not cause the coverage set forth on Section 7.7(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter to be canceled effective before December 31, 2016, subject
to the conditions in that Section.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall cause
the Company and each Company Subsidiary to keep in effect until December 31,
2016, severance plans, practices and policies applicable to U.S. Company
Employees that are no less favorable than such plans, practices and policies
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the
date hereof and in which such U.S. Company Employees were eligible to
participate (the details of which are set forth on Section 7.7(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter) and will comply with respect to Canadian Law
concerning severance with respect to Company Employees working in Canada
("Canadian Company Employees"), and Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company to, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any severance,
termination or retention liabilities or obligations with respect to such
employees effective on and after the Closing Date. This Section 7.7(b) shall
not apply to any Company Employees with individual agreements with the Company
that provide for severance in lieu of the foregoing severance plans, practices
and policies, which such agreements shall be assumed and honored as set forth
in Section 7.7(e).

(c) For purposes of the first plan year ending after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Company to take commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) ensure that no limitations or exclusions as to pre‑existing conditions,
evidence of insurability or good health, waiting periods or actively‑at‑work
exclusions or other limitations or restrictions on coverage are applicable to
any U.S. Company Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any
health, dental or vision benefit plans in which such employees may be eligible
to participate and (ii) provide or cause to be provided that any costs or
expenses incurred by U.S. Company Employees (and their dependents 

or beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Closing Date shall be taken into
account for such plan year for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
co‑payment, and coinsurance under any such health, dental or vision benefit
plans.

(d) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy, allowance or practice,
including severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies, allowances or
practices, sponsored or maintained by the Company or the Purchaser, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause the Company to, grant, or cause to be granted to, all
U.S. Company Employees (and, where applicable, Canadian Company Employees)
from and after the Closing Date credit for all service with the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, and their respective predecessors, prior to the Closing
Date) for all purposes (including eligibility to participate, vesting credit,
eligibility to commence benefits, and level of benefits (subject, in
Purchaser's discretion, to the accrual or carryover caps that Purchaser
applies for vacation and paid time off); provided, however, that in the event
Purchaser applies such accrual and carryover caps in a manner that results in
any U.S. Company Employee's forfeiting any vacation or paid time off, he or
she has accrued as of the Closing that he or she is not permitted to utilize,
Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to, reimburse such
U.S. Company Employee in cash, for the value of such forfeited vacation and
paid time off), but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan) to the extent (i) such service was recognized under a comparable
plan, policy, allowance or practice of the Company and/or a Company Subsidiary
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) recognition of such service will not result
in any duplication of benefits.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall
cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, assume and honor, in
accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date (or as they may be amended, terminated, or replaced in accordance
with their terms, and, if required by bilateral agreements, the consent of the
covered Company Employee), each individual employment, severance and change in
control Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party.

(f) If requested by Purchaser in writing delivered to the Company not less
than fifteen (15) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt
resolutions as are necessary to terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company 401(k) Plans"),
effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. In addition, if the Company
401(k) Plans are terminated, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (not to include any required plan amendment) to provide for rollovers
of assets and 401(k) loans.

(g) Section 7.7 is included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective transferees and permitted assigns and does not and shall not
create any right in any Person, including any prior, current, or future
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, 

any participant in any Employee Benefit Plan or any beneficiary or trustee
thereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement (express or implied) (i) is
intended to require Purchaser to establish or maintain any specific Employee
Benefit Plan for any length of time, (ii) is intended to create an Employee
Benefit Plan or comparable plan maintained by Purchaser or amend any of the
foregoing, (iii) is intended to confer upon any individual any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time, or any right to a
particular term or condition of employment, or (iv) shall be construed to
indicate existence of employment relations between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any of its service providers (including contractors and
consultants). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
parties do not intend for this Section 7.7 to create any rights or obligations
except between the parties hereto. No prior, current or future employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, including any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any other Person not a party to this Agreement, shall be entitled
to assert any claim against Sellers, Purchaser, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates under this Section 7.7.

(h) With respect to any individual listed on Section 7.7(h) of the Company
Disclosure Letter whose employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
after the Closing ends on or before the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall notify Sellers' Designee or its designee, in writing, of
any such individual's termination of employment with Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates. Such notice will include a statement as to whether the
individual's ceasing to be employed was on grounds constituting (i) "Good
Reason" or "Without Cause" or "Disability" under the definitions specified on
Section 7.7(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter (without any obligation to
specify which definition applies), (ii) death, or (iii) on other grounds. Any
such notice shall be delivered to Sellers' Designee or its designee within
five (5) Business Days of the effective date of such individual's termination
of employment. Purchaser agrees to promptly respond to any reasonable request
from Sellers' Designee inquiring as to whether any individual on the list
remains employed.

Section 7.8 Indemnity; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Blocker and the Company to, ensure that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation existing immediately prior to the date hereof
in favor of any individual who, at or prior to the Closing Date, was a
director or officer of the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or
who, at the request of the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, with such individual's heirs,
executors or administrators, the "DandO Indemnified Persons") as provided in the
respective governing documents of the Blocker, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and any indemnification agreements listed in Section 7.8 of the
Company Disclosure Letter to which the Company or any 

Company Subsidiary is party or bound are fulfilled and honored in all
respects; provided, that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made
within such six (6)‑year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all
such claims.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Company to, provide or maintain in effect through the purchase
of "run‑off" coverage or otherwise, directors' and officers' and corporate
liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") covering those individuals who are
covered by the directors' and officers' and corporate liability insurance
policy or policies provided for directors and officers of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the "Existing Policy") on terms
comparable in all respects to the Existing Policy and such coverage shall
contain minimum aggregate limits of liability for directors' and officers' and
corporate liability insurance coverage for directors and officers of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with the amount of coverage at least
equal to that of the Existing Policies and deductibles no larger than those of
the Existing Policy; provided, however, that if such "run‑off" or other
coverage is not available at a cost not greater than three hundred percent
(300%) of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof under the Existing
Policy (the "Insurance Cap"), then Purchaser shall be required to obtain as
much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such
annual premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap. If any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation involving any DandO Indemnified Person in any
capacity is asserted or made within six (6) years of the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause coverage under any such DandO Insurance described in this
Section 7.8(b) to be continued beyond such six (6)‑year period in respect of
such claim until the final disposition of such claim, action, proceeding or
investigation.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Purchaser
and the Company contained in this Section 7.8 shall be binding upon the
successors and assigns of Purchaser and the Company. In the event Purchaser or
the Company, or any of their respective successors or assigns, (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers fifty
percent (50%) or more of its properties or assets to any Person (including by
liquidation, dissolution or assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar
action), then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, assume
and honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section
7.8.

(d) Each of Purchaser, the Blocker and the Company shall jointly and severally
be an indemnitor of first resort without regard to any rights a DandO
Indemnified Person may have against any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates or otherwise or any insurer providing insurance coverage under an
insurance policy issued to any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates,
other than the DandO Insurance (such Persons, the "Other Indemnitors").
Purchaser irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases the Other Indemnitors
from any and all claims (i) against the Other Indemnitors for contribution,
subrogation, indemnification or any other recovery of any kind in 

respect thereof, and (ii) that any DandO Indemnified Person must seek expense
advancement or reimbursement, or indemnification, from any Other Indemnitor
before the Blocker, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or Purchaser must
perform its expense advancement and reimbursement, and indemnification
obligations, under this Agreement. Purchaser hereby further agrees that no
advancement, indemnification or other payment by the Other Indemnitors on
behalf of a DandO Indemnified Person with respect to any claim for which a DandO
Indemnified Person has sought indemnification from Purchaser, the Blocker, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall affect the foregoing, and the Other
Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the
extent of such advancement, indemnification or other payment to all of the
rights of recovery of such DandO Indemnified Person against Purchaser, the
Blocker, the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) The obligations of Purchaser and the Company under this Section 7.8 shall
survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to affect adversely any DandO Indemnified Person to whom this Section 7.8
applies without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified Person (it being
expressly agreed that the DandO Indemnified Persons to whom this Section 7.8
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.8). The
provisions of this Section 7.8 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person, his, her or its heirs
and his or her Representatives, and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by Law, Contract or otherwise.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or
officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for
in this Section 7.8 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims
under such policies.

Section 7.9 Public Announcements. The initial press releases to be issued with
respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be in the form
mutually agreed by the parties. The parties agree that such press releases
will be issued promptly following execution of this Agreement. Each Seller,
the Blocker, the Company and Purchaser each shall (a) consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) provide to the
other parties for review a copy of any such press release or public statement,
and (c) not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation and review and the receipt of the prior consent of
(i) Purchaser, in the case of any press release or public statement by any
Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Blocker or the Company or (ii) the
Sellers, in the case of any press release or public statement by Purchaser, or
after the Closing, the Blocker or the Company, in each case, unless required
by applicable Law or regulations of any applicable stock exchange (provided
that, to the 

extent not prohibited by applicable Law, a party shall to the extent
reasonably practicable consult with the other parties prior to making any such
disclosure required by Law or regulations of any applicable stock exchange);
provided, however, that (x) following the initial press release, the foregoing
shall not restrict or prohibit the Company or Purchaser from making any
announcement through the Closing Date (after prior consultation with the other
to the extent practicable under the circumstances) to its employees, customers
and other business relations to the extent it determines in good faith that
such announcement is necessary or advisable, (y) any Affiliate of a Seller may
disclose the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any information
related thereto and any of the terms hereof to its actual or potential limited
partners or other investors in the Ordinary Course of Business, and (z)
nothing in this Section 7.9 shall prohibit any disclosure required under the
Credit Agreement or any other Contract to which the Blocker, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party.

Section 7.10 Notification of Certain Matters; Supplemental Disclosure.

(a) The Blocker, the Company and each Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly notify each other of (i) any material Actions in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced or, to the Knowledge
of the Blocker, Knowledge of the Company, the Knowledge of Sellers or the
Knowledge of Purchaser, as the case may be, threatened, against the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries, any Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, (ii)
any cancelation or termination by any of the Top Fleet Customers, Top
Merchants, Top Factoring Customers or Top Suppliers of its relationship with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the receipt of any written notice
from any such Person that any such Person may cancel, terminate or otherwise
materially and adversely modify its relationship with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or (iii) the occurrence or non‑occurrence of any fact or
event which would be reasonably expected to cause any condition set forth in
ARTICLE VIII not to be satisfied; provided, that a party's failure to give
notice of any such occurrence as required pursuant to this Section 7.10(a)
shall not be taken into account in determining whether the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VIII have been satisfied.

(b) Not less than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver to Purchaser a supplement to the Seller Disclosure Letter and
the Company and the Blocker shall deliver to Purchaser a supplement to the
Company Disclosure Letter, in each case disclosing any actions, events or
changes in circumstances arising after the date of this Agreement that, if
arising prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have
been disclosed pursuant to such party's representations or warranties;
provided, that failure to provide disclosure required pursuant to this Section
7.10(b) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE VIII have been satisfied; provided further, that such
supplemental disclosure shall not be deemed to (i) cure any breach of any
Fundamental Representation for purposes of ARTICLE X or (ii) except to the
extent such supplemental disclosure is contemplated by any 

particular representation or warranty, cure any breach of any representation
or warranty of the Sellers, the Blocker or Company set forth in this Agreement
for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII
have been satisfied.

Section 7.11 Preservation of Records.

(a) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such other
longer period as required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall preserve and
retain, and shall cause the Blocker, the Company, and each Company Subsidiary
to preserve and retain, all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human
resources and other books and records of the Blocker, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (including (i) any documents relating to any governmental
or non‑governmental claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations and
(ii) all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and other material records or
other documents relating to Taxes of the Company) relating to the conduct of
the business and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior

7.11(a) shall cease to apply in the event of a sale or disposition of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries by Purchaser.

(b) To the extent reasonably required in connection with any insurance claims
by, Actions or Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, compliance
with legal requirements by or the preparation of financial statements of any

with any other matter relating to or resulting from this Agreement (other than
in any matter relating to a potential or actual dispute arising out of this
Agreement), Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company to, reasonably
cooperate with such Seller or Sellers' Designee, as applicable, and its
counsel in the defense or contest, make available their personnel, and provide
such testimony and access to the Books and Records as shall be necessary or
reasonably requested in connection therewith, all at the sole cost and expense
of such Seller. Such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) To the extent reasonably required in connection with any insurance claims
by, Actions or Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, compliance
with legal requirements by, or the preparation of financial statements of the
Blocker, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or Purchaser or any of their

relating to a potential or actual dispute arising out of this Agreement), each
Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser and its counsel in the defense or
contest, make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access
to the books and records of such Seller as shall be necessary or reasonably
requested in connection therewith, all at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser. Such 

requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of any Seller or its Affiliates.

Section 7.12 Resignation of Members of Governing Bodies. At the written
request of Purchaser (which request shall be delivered at least three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing) with respect to any officer or member of
the board of managers, board of directors, executive committee or similar
governing body of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who was appointed by
a Seller, each Seller shall (i) cause any such Person who is an employee of
any Seller, or of any controlling Affiliate of any Seller, to tender his or
her resignation from such position effective as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Person who is not an
employee of any Seller to tender his or her resignation (or, if such Person
refuses to tender his or her resignation, to effect the removal of such
Person) from such position effective as of the Closing Date.

Section 7.13 Conflicts; Privileges. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that (x) the Blocker, the Company and each Seller has retained Cleary
Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP ("CGSH") to act as its counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) CGSH has not acted as counsel
for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and that no other party to this Agreement or Person has the status of a client
of CGSH for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof and
(z) CGSH intends to act as legal counsel to the Sellers (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers' Designee) and their Affiliates after the
Closing. Purchaser hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises
between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the
Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and any Seller, or any of
its Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Blocker, the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries), CGSH may represent any such Seller or any such
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such Seller or such
Affiliate may be directly adverse to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Blocker, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries), and even though CGSH may have represented the Blocker, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, the Blocker, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries, Purchaser, the Blocker and the Company
hereby waive, on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates, (a) any
claim they have or may have that CGSH has a conflict of interest in connection
with or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and (b)
agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Blocker,
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries) and the Blocker, the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries, or any Seller or Affiliate of any Seller, CGSH may
represent any such party in such dispute even though the interest of any such
party may be directly adverse to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries), the
Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries and even though CGSH may have
represented the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially 

related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Purchaser, the
Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. Purchaser further agrees
that, (i) as to all communications between CGSH and any Seller that relate in
any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney‑client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other
rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to such Seller and may be
controlled by such Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser,
the Blocker, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and (ii) as to all
communications prior to the Closing between CGSH and the Blocker or the
Company, or among CGSH, the Blocker, the Company and/or one or more Sellers,
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney‑client privilege, the expectation of client confidence and all other
rights to evidentiary privilege belong to Sellers and may be controlled by
Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Blocker, the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries. Each of Purchaser, the Blocker and the
Company acknowledges and agrees that from and after Closing (i) the Blocker,
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries (and their respective Affiliates) shall
not have access to any such communications or to the files of CGSH relating to
such engagement and (ii) CGSH shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney‑client communications or files to the Blocker, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates by reason of any attorney‑client
relationship between CGSH and the Blocker, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or otherwise. Purchaser agrees to take, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the
intent of this Section 7.13. The parties hereto further agree that CGSH and
its partners and employees are third‑party beneficiaries of this Section 7.13
and that this Section 7.13 may not be amended, waived or modified without the
prior written consent of CGSH.

Section 7.14 Financing.

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) on or
prior to the Closing Date. Such actions shall include: (i) maintaining in full
force and effect the Debt Commitment Letter(s) in the form provided to the
Company on or prior to the date hereof (provided that the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as set forth
below), (ii) satisfying on a timely basis (or obtaining the waiver of, taking
into account the expected timing of the Closing) all of the conditions
precedent and covenants to the Debt Financing applicable to Purchaser that are
to be satisfied by Purchaser, (iii) negotiating, executing and delivering
definitive documents ("Debt Financing Documents") that reflect the terms
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) (including, as necessary, agreeing
to any requested changes to the commitments thereunder in accordance with any
"flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter(s) or any related
fee letter), in each case which terms shall not in any respect expand on the
conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing at Closing or reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing available to be funded on the Closing
Date, 

and to the extent the Debt Financing Documents are executed and delivered
prior to the Closing, maintaining in full force and effect and enforcing the
Debt Financing Documents, (iv) drawing the full amount of the Debt Financing
needed to fund the transactions contemplated hereunder and (v) fully enforcing
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter(s) and the Debt Financing
Documents in order to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing.
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without
the prior written consent of the Company, take or fail to take any action or
enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to materially
impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Debt Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter(s). Purchaser shall comply with all of its
obligations under each of the Debt Financing Documents. Subject to Section
7.14(c), Purchaser shall not permit or consent to (x) any amendment,
supplement or modification to be made to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) if such
amendment, supplement or modification would (A) adversely change, expand or
impose new conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt Financing from
those set forth therein on the date hereof, (B) adversely change the timing of
the funding of the Debt Financing thereunder or reasonably be expected to
impair, delay or prevent the availability of all or a portion of the Debt
Financing or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (C) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions
existing on the date hereof)) or (D) otherwise adversely affect the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
timing of the Closing; (y) any waiver of any provision or remedy under the
Debt Commitment Letter(s) (other than a condition to funding in favor of the
lenders thereunder), or (z) early termination of the Debt Commitment
Letter(s). For purposes of this Agreement, references to the "Debt Commitment
Letter(s)" shall include such document(s) as permitted or required by this
Section 7.14 to be amended, modified, waived or substituted, in each case from
and after such amendment, modification, waiver or substitution. Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not conditioned or contingent upon receipt
of the Debt Financing and a failure of the Closing to occur because Purchaser
shall not have received the proceeds contemplated by the Debt Financing shall
constitute a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser. Purchaser shall keep the
Company fully informed, in all reasonable detail, of the status of its efforts
to arrange the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall provide the Company, upon
reasonable request, with copies of any Debt Financing Documents and such other
information and documentation regarding the Debt Financing as shall be
reasonably necessary to allow the Company to monitor the progress of such
financing activities.

(b) Purchaser shall apprise the Company of material developments relating to
the Debt Financing and shall give the Company notice of any material adverse
change with respect to such Debt Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall promptly (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days)
notify the Company in writing (i) of Purchaser's Knowledge 

of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) or Debt
Financing Documents, (ii) of the receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives of any notice or other communication from the Debt
Financing Source(s), any lender or any other Person with respect to any (A)
actual, threatened or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) or any Debt Financing Document or
any provision of the Debt Financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter(s) or Debt Financing Document (including any proposal by the
Debt Financing Source(s), lender or other Person to withdraw, terminate or
make a material change in the terms of (including the amount of Debt Financing
contemplated by) the Debt Commitment Letter(s)) or (B) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to Debt Commitment Letter(s) or any
Debt Financing Document if such dispute or disagreement would reasonably be
expected to affect the timely availability of, or amount of, the Debt
Financing, and (iii) of the termination or expiration of the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) or Debt Financing Documents for any reason. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the Company
delivers to Purchaser a written request, Purchaser shall provide any
information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any of the
circumstances referred to in this Section 7.14(b).

(c) In the event of any Financing Failure Event, Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange for
and obtain as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of any such
Financing Failure Event an alternative debt financing (an "Alternative
Financing"), including from alternative sources on whatever terms are then
available to Purchaser, whether or not such terms are more or less favorable
to Purchaser than the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter(s), in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and perform all
of its obligations hereunder, it being understood and agreed that if Purchaser
proceeds with any Alternative Financing, Purchaser shall be subject to the
same obligations with respect to such Alternative Financing as set forth in
this Agreement with respect to the Debt Financing. In the event that
Alternative Financing is obtained, Purchaser shall promptly provide the
Company with true, correct and complete copies of the new financing commitment
that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter"). In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained and an
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter is entered into, any reference in this
Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing", any
reference to "Debt Commitment Letter(s)" shall include the "Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter" and any references to "Debt Financing Documents"
shall include the definitive documentation relating to any such Alternative
Financing.

(d) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall
cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to cause the
respective officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting,
of the Company and the Company 

Subsidiaries to, provide to Purchaser, on a timely basis at Purchaser's sole
expense, all cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing as is customary and may be reasonably requested by Purchaser,
including:

the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to provide (x) pro forma financial statements or pro
forma adjustments reflecting the Debt Financing, Alternative Financing, or (y)
any description of all or any component of the Debt Financing, Alternative
Financing (all such information in this clause (i), collectively, the
"Required Information");

together with customary stock powers executed in blank, with respect to the
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries that are required by the Debt
Commitment Letter(s) to be delivered in order to perfect the security

Closing;

(iii) causing the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' senior officers to
participate, but only together with the senior officers of Purchaser and its

Commitment Letter(s), and reasonable assistance in preparing one or more

accurately reflected therein and the information relating to the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries included therein shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Company);

(iv) assisting Purchaser in preparing customary rating agency presentations in
connection with the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment

including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended;

provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide, or cause

that: (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary; (B) causes any representation or warranty in this
Agreement to be breached; (C) causes any closing condition set forth in
ARTICLE VIII to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of this
Agreement or any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

lapse of time, or both) under, the Company or the Company Subsidiary's
organizational documents, any applicable Laws, or any other Contract to which
the Company or the Company Subsidiary is a party thereto; or (E) requires the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers,
managers or employees to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any
agreement, document or instrument, including any Debt Financing Document (but
excluding the customary authorization letters described above), with respect
to the Debt Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing and the directors and managers of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to adopt resolutions
approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to which 

the Debt Financing is obtained, in each case which are effective prior to the

be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or incur any Liability
(including due to any act or omission by any Seller, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives) or expense in
connection with assisting Purchaser in arranging the Debt Financing or as a
result of any information provided by any Seller, the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates or Representatives in connection
therewith. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and the Company
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the debt financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter(s); provided, that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and on such other customary terms and
conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors,
employees, accountants, legal counsel and other Representatives shall be
required to take any action that would subject such Person to actual or
potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Debt Financing or their performance of their respective obligations
under this Section 7.14 and any information utilized in connection therewith.
Purchaser shall (1) promptly upon request by any Seller or the Company
reimburse each Seller and the Company for all reasonable and documented
out‑of‑pocket costs incurred in good faith by such Seller, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation (including those of
their accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
Representatives), including cooperation pursuant to Section 7.14(d) and (1)
indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, the Company, and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt

(other than to the extent related to information provided by the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained
in this Section 7.14, represent the sole obligation of any Seller, the
Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing.

(f) To the extent that this Section 7.14 requires the Company's cooperation
with respect to any of Purchaser's obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter(s) or relating to the Debt Financing, the Company shall be deemed to
have complied with this Section 7.14 for purposes of ARTICLE XI of this
Agreement if the Company has provided Purchaser with the assistance required
under this Section 7.14 with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter(s) and the
Debt Financing, in each case without giving effect to any Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter or 

Alternative Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition
set forth in Section 8.2(a), as it applies to the Company's obligations under
this Section 7.14, shall be deemed satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not
been obtained primarily as a result of the Company's Willful Breach of its
obligations under this Section 7.14.

Section 7.15 Aggregate Stock Consideration Amount. Purchaser undertakes from
the date of this Agreement until such time as the Aggregate Stock
Consideration shall have been issued to Sellers' Designee (on behalf of the

Common Stock to issue the Aggregate Stock Consideration to Sellers' Designee

provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

any dispositions or acquisitions of shares of Purchaser Common Stock

who will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
Purchaser, including Warburg Pincus and any director designated thereby, to be
exempt under Rule 16b‑3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.19 Purchaser Board of Directors. Prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall take all such actions as are necessary to appoint, and shall
appoint, effective as of the Closing, James C. Neary (or if he is unwilling or
unable to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of Purchaser, such other
Person as the Sellers' Designee may designate that is reasonably acceptable to
the Board of Directors of Purchaser) as a member of (A) the class of directors
elected to Purchaser's Board of Directors at the annual meeting of Purchaser's
stockholders most recently preceding the Closing and (B) the Compensation
Committee or the Corporate Governance Committee, as agreed by the Company and
Sellers' Designee in good faith, of the Purchaser's Board of Directors (which
designee shall, as a condition to joining any such committee, meet the
applicable "independence" requirements of the SEC and NYSE in the reasonable
determination of Purchaser's Board of Directors), in each case, to hold office
in accordance with Purchaser's certificate of incorporation 

and by‑laws, and, to the extent required, shall increase the size of
Purchaser's Board of Directors to permit such appointment. Such director shall
have agreed, as a condition to his appointment, to tender his resignation at
the request of Purchaser's Board of Directors by majority vote at any time
that the Purchaser Common Stock collectively held by Sellers and their
Affiliates has had a market value of less than $200 million (based on the
Purchaser Daily Closing Price) for at least twenty (20) consecutive trading
days ending on (and including) the date of such request. "Purchaser Daily
Closing Price" shall mean on any trading day, the closing-sale per share price
of Purchaser Common Stock as reported by the Wall Street Journal for such
trading day.

Section 7.20 FTC Notice. If, upon inquiry by the Company or its Counsel, the
FTC indicates that a notice of the proposed acquisition of the Company is
required pursuant to the FTC Order in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall provide such notice to the
FTC as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement (unless a later date is mutually agreed
between Purchaser and the Sellers, the Blocker, and the Company).

Section 7.21 Plant Closing and Mass Layoffs. For a period of ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company

Company to, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any Liability with
respect to the preceding sentence.

Section 7.22 Internal Restructuring. Prior to the Closing, Sellers, the
Blocker, the Promote Vehicle and the Company shall complete the Internal
Restructuring substantially as set forth on Annex C; provided that in
completing the Internal Restructuring, the Sellers, the Promote Vehicle and
the Company may make such changes to the steps set forth on Annex C so long as
such changes do not result in (i) the Blocker owning, directly or indirectly,
materially more of the equity interests of the Company than it would have
absent such changes or (ii) an adverse effect on the tax basis of the assets
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent relevant to the
taxation of the Blocker. At least thirty (30) days prior to the Internal
Restructuring, Sellers' Designee shall provide Purchaser with a copy of all
transaction documents related to the Internal Restructuring (a) to which the
Blocker, the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or (b) which modify
the direct or, to the extent material to Purchaser, beneficial ownership of
the Blocker, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, for review and comment and
shall consider in good faith any comments received from Purchaser within
fifteen (15) days of providing Purchaser with such draft. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties acknowledge that the ownership percentages set forth on
Annex C are based in part on an assumed market price per share of Purchaser
Common Stock which is subject to change and certain other assumptions set
forth therein. 

Section 7.23 Termination of Affiliate Arrangements. Sellers shall (i) cause
(A) any Contracts between the Blocker, the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any Seller or any controlling Affiliate of any Seller, on
the other hand, to be terminated as of the Closing Date and (B) all
obligations and Liabilities thereunder to be deemed to have been satisfied or
released and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts (A) to cause any Contracts
between the Blocker, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and any other Affiliate of any Seller, on the other hand, other than Contracts
to which only the Company and any Company Subsidiaries are party, to be
terminated as of the Closing Date and (B) to cause all obligations and
Liabilities thereunder to be deemed to have been satisfied or released.

Section 7.24 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing Date,
upon request of any party to this Agreement, each other party shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver all such other instruments and documents and shall
take such other actions as may be reasonably required to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
Purchaser shall not be required to pay any further consideration or amounts
therefor.

ARTICLE IX 
TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1 Tax Indemnification. Each Seller shall severally (and not
jointly), in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Seller Liability Share,
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and all cash
Taxes incurred or sustained by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after
the Closing Date as a result of the Internal Restructuring or any adverse
effect on items included in the calculation of the Company Tax Benefit Amount
to the extent there would be an adverse effect on the amount of the Company
Tax Benefit Amount taken into account in the Purchase Price if such amount
were recalculated after the adverse effect on such items.

Section 9.2 Tax Treatment of Transfers. Each of the Company, Sellers and
Purchaser agree to treat, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (i) the
transfer of Company Units by or caused by each of the Company Seller and GP
Seller as a sale of an interest in a partnership and (ii) the transfer of
Blocker Units by or caused by the Blocker Seller as a sale of an interest in a
corporation. 

The parties hereto further agree that, (A) for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, the transfer of the Company Units shall result in a termination of
the Company's treatment as a partnership for purposes of Section 708 of the
Code, (B) the taxable year of the Company shall close as of the end of the day
on the Closing Date, and (C) any business conducted by the Company following
the Closing Date shall be for the account of Purchaser. A closing of the books
method shall be used for purposes of determining Tax items (such as income,
gain, losses, and deductions) of the Company allocated between the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing
Date.

Section 9.3 Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.3(a), after the Closing,
Purchaser shall have the obligation and authority to file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns to be filed by or with respect to the income, assets,
properties, and operations of the Blocker, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or any successor thereto for any taxable year or other taxable
period. Sellers' Designee shall prepare and file or cause to be filed any Tax
Return for a Pre-Closing Period with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries relating to (i) income Taxes (but excluding any Tax Return of a
Company Subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes) or (ii) any other Taxes imposed on Sellers as a result of the
Company's treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal, state or local income
Tax purposes, which shall, for the avoidance of doubt, include the final U.S.
federal income Tax Return for the taxable year of the Company ending on the
Closing Date (the "Company's Final Federal Return"), but shall exclude any Tax
imposed under the Laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof. Any
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past practices of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (unless otherwise required by applicable
Laws or Section 9.7); provided, however, that the Company's Final Federal
Return shall be prepared by Sellers' Designee using a closing of the books
method in accordance with Section 9.2 hereof. Any Tax Returns prepared by
Sellers' Designee shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant schedules,
work papers, and other documentation then available) to Purchaser for
Purchaser's review and comment not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the
due date for the filing of such Tax Return; provided, however, that the
Company's Final Federal Return shall be provided to Purchaser for Purchaser's
review, comment and, solely to the extent set forth in the following sentence,
approval, no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date for purposes of
determining the Company Tax Benefits Amount. Sellers' Designee shall consider
in good faith any comments to such Tax Returns provided by Purchaser;
provided, however, that the Company's Final Federal Return shall be subject to
the Purchaser's approval with respect to those items relating to the
determination of the Company Tax Benefits Amount. Purchaser and Sellers'
Designee shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding the
Company's Final Federal Return for purposes of determining the Company Tax
Benefits Amount; provided, however, that if any such dispute is not resolved
by the Purchaser and Sellers' Designee cooperating in good faith within
fifteen (15) days, the resolution of such dispute shall be submitted to the
Neutral 

Referee for resolution in accordance with Section 2.3(c), including the
payment of expenses by each party in accordance with Section 2.3(c)(iv). For
the avoidance of doubt, if any dispute regarding the Company's Final Federal
Return prevents the Purchaser from delivering a complete and/or final Closing
Statement pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, the Purchaser shall not be deemed to
have failed to timely deliver the Closing Statement required by Section 2.3.

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall (or shall cause or
permit the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to) amend, refile or otherwise
modify, or, subject to Section 9.4, consent to any settlement or payment
involving a Tax Matter with respect to, any Tax Return relating in whole or in
part to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period or with respect to any Overlap Period, if such amendment,
refiling or other modification or consent to any settlement or payment may
cause an adverse Tax consequence to Sellers' Tax liability, without the
written consent of Sellers' Designee, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.4 Controversies.

(a) Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers' Designee upon receipt by
Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser (including the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) of written notice or other communication
of any Tax Matter which relates to income Taxes of a Pre-Closing Period of the
Company or Company Subsidiaries (other than a Company Subsidiary that is
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and other than
Tax Matters relating to Taxes imposed under the Laws of Canada or any
political subdivision thereof) ("Seller Tax Matter"). Sellers' Designee, at
its sole expense, shall have the authority to represent the interests of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Seller Tax Matter
before any Tax authority or any other Governmental Entity and shall have the
right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of such Seller
Tax Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing Tax Returns and
contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, such Seller Tax Matter; provided, that neither Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Tax Matter that adversely affects or may adversely affect
the Tax liability of Purchaser, the Blocker, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the foregoing, without the prior written
consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Sellers shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Seller Tax Matter which
Sellers may control pursuant to this section. Sellers shall, in good faith,
allow Purchaser to make comments to Sellers, regarding the conduct of or
positions taken in any such proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall be entitled to participate in any
Tax Matter relating to the deductibility of Company Expenses that were
included in the calculation of the Company Tax Benefits Amount and allocated
to the Blocker. 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.4(a), or if Sellers do not elect
to control a proceeding pursuant to Section 9.4(a), Purchaser shall have the
sole right to control any audit or examination by any Tax authority, initiate
any claim for refund, amend any Tax Return, and contest, resolve, settle and
defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency
or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to, the income, assets or
operations of the Blocker, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for
all taxable periods; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not, and shall
cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any
settlement of any contest or otherwise compromise any issue with respect to
the portion of the Overlap Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date that
could increase the Tax liability of Sellers without the prior written consent
of Sellers' Designee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

Section 9.5 Post-Closing Access and Cooperation.

(a) After the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers' Designee and each Seller, on the
other hand, shall furnish or cause to be delivered to each other, upon
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
(including access to books, records, work papers and Tax Returns for Pre-
Closing Periods) relating to the Blocker, Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as is reasonably necessary for the preparation of any Tax Return including,
for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's review and approval of the Company's
Final Federal Return as set forth under Section 9.3 hereof, claim for refund
or audit, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any proposed Tax adjustment. Upon reasonable notice and during
regular business hours, Sellers' Designee and Purchaser shall make their, or
shall cause the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to make
their employees and facilities available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide reasonable explanation of any documents or information provided
hereunder; provided, that such assistance shall not unreasonably disrupt the
operations of Sellers' Designee, Purchaser, the Company or such Company
Subsidiary, as applicable, and any recipient of such assistance shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any such disruption.

(b) Any request for information or documents pursuant to this Section 9.5
shall be made by the requesting party in writing. The other party hereto shall
promptly (and in no event later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the
request) provide the requested information. The requesting party shall
indemnify the other party for any out of pocket expenses incurred by such
party in this Section 9.5. Any information obtained under this Section 9.5
shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise reasonably may be necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting any Tax audit, dispute or contest.

Section 9.6 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Sellers, the Blocker, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall cause the termination prior to the
Closing Date of all Tax sharing 

and indemnity agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving
the Blocker, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and any Person
other than the Blocker, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and, after
the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Blocker, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

Section 9.7 Elections. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries not to, without the
prior consent of Sellers (which may, in their sole and absolute discretion,
withhold such consent), make, cause or permit to be made any Tax election or
adopt or change any method of accounting, in each case that may adversely
affect Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (other than a Company Subsidiary that is treated as a corporation
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or otherwise adversely affect the Tax
liability of Sellers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers
agree that (i) the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries that is
treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall make an
election under Section 754 of the Code (x) on the Company's Final Federal
Return and the final U.S. federal income Tax Return for each Company
Subsidiary for the taxable year of such entity ending on the Closing Date and
(x) at the request of Purchaser, on any U.S. federal income Tax Return
required to be filed as a result of a termination of such entity's treatment
as a partnership for purposes of Section 708 of the Code prior to the Closing
Date as a result of the Internal Restructuring, and (ii) this Section 9.7
shall not affect the ability of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to,
without the consent of Sellers, make, cause or permit to be made any Tax
election or adopt or change any method of accounting, in relation to Taxes
imposed under the Laws of Canada or any political subdivision thereof.

Section 9.8 Transfer Taxes. Purchaser on the one hand and Sellers on the other
hand shall share equally any stamp, transfer, documentary, sales and use,
value added, registration and other such taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement or any
other transaction contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes").
Unless required by applicable Law, the Purchaser shall be responsible for
preparing and timely filing any Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer
Taxes, and shall present such Tax Returns to the Sellers' Designee for is
review and comment no later than then (10) days before such Tax Returns are
required to be filed, and Sellers shall, after the filing of such tax Return,
promptly remit to Purchaser its share of any such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser
and Sellers' Designee shall cooperate to procure any stock transfer stamps
required by, and properly file on a timely basis all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to, any of the Transfer Taxes.

Section 9.9 Survival. All obligations under this ARTICLE IX shall survive the
Closing Date and continue until 30 days following the expiration of the
statute of limitations on assessment of the relevant Tax, unless a claim for
indemnification under this ARTICLE IX has been made within such period in
which case the provisions of this ARTICLE IX shall continue in respect of 

such claim until final resolution thereof and the discharge of any liability
determined by such resolution.

Section 9.10 Cap. The maximum amount that Purchaser may recover from all
Sellers in the aggregate under Section 9.1 shall be limited to the pro rata
Transaction Consideration payable to the Blocker Sellers.

resolution of the matter covered by such notice and the discharge of any
liability determined by such resolution and (ii) any Claim for Fraud arising
in connection with the representations and warranties made in this Agreement
shall survive until the applicable statute of limitations has expired.

Section 10.3 Limitations on Recovery.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) in no event shall the aggregate liability of any Seller pursuant to this
ARTICLE X exceed the Seller Consideration of such Seller; and

(ii) each Seller shall be solely responsible for any Damages resulting from
the breach of any representation or warranty made solely by such Seller in
this Agreement.

(b) Order of Recourse, Insurance Efforts and Setoff. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

(i) Definitions. The following terms shall have the following meanings:

| 
---|--- 

A.

|

"Available Recourse Funds" means any portion of the Rep and Warranty Insurance
Amount that: (A) could reasonably be expected to provide coverage for the
particular matter at issue; and (B) remains available under the Rep and
Warranty Insurance Policy. 

| 
---|--- 

B.

|

"Potentially Uninsured Damages" means any Damages: (A) for which Purchaser
seeks indemnification, reimbursement or compensation pursuant to ARTICLE X;
(B) for which Purchaser has made a claim under the Rep and Warranty Insurance
Policy in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof; and (C) with
respect to which the Rep and Warranty Insurer has delivered or caused to be
delivered a written notice denying that such Damages are covered by the Rep
and Warranty Insurance Policy (which written notice has been delivered to
Sellers' Designee reasonably promptly following receipt thereof); provided,
however, that such Damages shall cease to be Potentially Uninsured Damages
upon the Rep and Warranty Insurer delivering a written notice to Purchaser
accepting or it is otherwise determined, through Order or other means legally
binding the Rep and Warranty Insurer that such Damages are covered by the Rep
and Warranty Insurance Policy. 

(ii) Order of Recourse.

| 
---|--- 

A.

|

If any Purchaser Indemnified Party has (or claims to have) Damages for which
any of the Sellers may be liable to a Purchaser Indemnified Party under
ARTICLE X and such Damages may be insured (in whole or in part) by the Rep and
Warranty Insurance Policy, then: 

| 
---|--- 

B.

|

prior to seeking indemnification for such Damages from any Seller, such
Purchaser Indemnified Party (or Purchaser, on such Purchaser Indemnified
Party's behalf) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue insurance
for such Damages against the Rep and Warranty Insurance Policy until such
Damages become Potentially Uninsured Damages; provided, however, that to the
extent that such Purchaser Indemnified Party reasonably, and in good faith,
seeks indemnification for Damages in excess of the Available Recourse Funds,
then such Purchaser Indemnified Party may simultaneously seek Damages in an
amount equal to the total claimed Damages minus 

the Available Recourse Funds from the Sellers pursuant to ARTICLE X;

| 
---|--- 

C.

|

upon such Damages becoming Potentially Uninsured Damages, such Purchaser
Indemnified Party (or Purchaser, on such Purchaser Indemnified Party's behalf)
may seek indemnification from the Sellers pursuant to ARTICLE X (but without
limiting the obligation of the Purchaser Indemnified Party to use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue such insurance; provided that such commercially
reasonable efforts shall not require the initiation of litigation or other
dispute resolution procedures); and 

| 
---|--- 

D.

|

upon any such Damages that are Potentially Uninsured Damages ceasing to be
Potentially Uninsured Damages, such Purchaser Indemnified Party (and
Purchaser, to the extent Purchaser is acting on behalf of such Purchaser
Indemnified Party) shall immediately cease seeking indemnification for such
Damages from the Sellers, and shall instead use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue insurance for such Damages against the Rep and Warranty
Insurance Policy and shall refund to Sellers any amounts previously paid by
Sellers in respect of such Damages in accordance with Section 10.3(b)(iii). 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the amount of Damages that any Indemnified Party may recover from Sellers for
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE X shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds (including proceeds paid pursuant to any representations
and warranties insurance policy), indemnification payments and other third-
party recoveries actually recovered by any Indemnified Party. In the event any
Indemnified Party is potentially entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity
payments or any third-party recoveries in respect of any Damages for which
such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE
X, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
or receive such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that
any such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries are recovered by the Indemnified Party, subsequent to receipt by
such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect of
the Claims to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other
third-party recoveries relate, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay the
amount of such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries to the Indemnifying Party. 

(iv) The rights to indemnification set forth in this ARTICLE X shall not be
affected by (a) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any
Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, or (b) any waiver by any Indemnified Party of any
closing condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties
or the performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants, it being
agreed that each party, in entering into this Agreement, has bargained for the
accuracy of, or compliance with, each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement of the other parties contained herein.

(v) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Designee
with a copy of the Rep and Warranty Insurance Policy and, thereafter, shall
reasonably promptly provide the Sellers' Designee with copies of any
amendments or modifications to the Rep and Warranty Insurance.

Section 10.4 Notice of Claims.

(a) Any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party seeking
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall give (a) to
Purchaser, in the case of indemnification sought by any Seller Indemnified
Party, or (b) to Sellers' Designee in the case of indemnification sought by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party, a written notice (a "Claim Notice")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise, or that could
reasonably be expected to give rise, to the Claim for indemnification
hereunder that is the subject of the Claim Notice. The Claim Notice shall
include an estimate of the amount and the method of computation of the amount
of Damages arising in connection with such Claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement upon which such Claim is based and all material
documentation relevant to the Claim (to the extent not previously provided
under this Section 10.4). A Claim Notice shall be given promptly following the
claimant's determination that facts or events are reasonably expected to give
rise to a Claim for indemnification hereunder.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 10.4 shall
not apply in the case of a Claim Notice provided in connection with a Claim by
a third party made against an Indemnified Party, which Claims shall be
governed by Section 10.5.

Section 10.5 Third Party Claims. In the event that an Indemnified Party
becomes aware of a third party Claim which such Indemnified Party believes may
result in a Claim for indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE X (a "Third
Party Claim"), the following shall apply: 

(a) Such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of
such Third Party Claim (the "Third Party Claim Notice") within the limitation
period provided for in Section 10.2. The Third Party Claim Notice shall (if
and to the extent then known) describe in reasonable detail the facts giving
rise or that could reasonably be expected to give rise to the Claim for
indemnification hereunder that is the subject of the Third Party Claim Notice,
the amount and the method of computation of the amount of Damages arising in
connection with such Claim, a reference to the provision of this Agreement
upon which such Claim is based and all material documentation relevant to the
Claim described in the Third Party Claim Notice (to the extent not previously
provided under this Section 10.5). A Third Party Claim Notice shall be given
promptly following the claimant's determination of facts or events that are
reasonably expected to give rise to a Claim for indemnification hereunder;
provided that in respect of any Action by or against a third party as to which
indemnification will be sought, notice shall be given promptly following
receipt of notice of the assertion or commencement of such Action or receipt
of a written notice threatening the assertion of the same. No delay in
notifying such Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement shall affect an Indemnified Party's rights, unless
such Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) Subject to Section 10.5(c), the Indemnifying Party at its sole expense may
assume the defense thereof by advising the Indemnified Party in writing that
it will undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing
and at its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof and in which event
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith;
provided, that the Indemnified Party may participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party and paid at its own
expense; provided, further, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for
such Indemnified Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses
of one counsel and one local counsel, if applicable, to such Indemnified Party
in connection with such defense.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to enter into any compromise
or settlement that is dispositive of the matter involved; provided, however,
that except for the settlement of a Third Party Claim that involves (a) no
obligation of any Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof other than the
payment of money for which the Indemnifying Party is fully liable pursuant to
this ARTICLE X and (b) a release from all liability in respect of such Third
Party Claim in favor of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, the
Indemnifying Party shall not settle, consent to entry of any judgment with
respect to or otherwise compromise any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party.

(d) The party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this
Section 10.5 shall keep the other party reasonably advised of the status of
such Third Party Claim 

and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made
by the other party with respect thereto.

Section 10.6 Form of Indemnity Payments. The Sellers may elect, at their sole
discretion, to satisfy any obligations to make any payments to any Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under this ARTICLE X by delivering to such Purchaser
Indemnified Parties a portion of the Aggregate Stock Consideration of a value
equal to the amount required to be paid in accordance with this ARTICLE X,
based on a per share price equal to the average, rounded to the nearest one
ten-thousandth, of the closing-sale per share price of Purchaser Common Stock
on the NYSE as reported by the Wall Street Journal for each of the five full
trading days ending on (and including) the third Business Day preceding the
date of such delivery.

Section 10.7 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, the remedies in
this ARTICLE X shall be the exclusive remedies of the parties with respect to
any and all matters covered by this Agreement, other than (a) the covenants,
obligations and other agreements contained in this Agreement that are to be
performed in whole or in part after the Closing, (b) the remedies of specific
performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, as provided in Section
12.12 with respect to such covenants, obligations and agreements, (c) all
matters relating to Taxes, which will be governed by ARTICLE IX, (d) the
Investor Rights Agreement and (e) the Principal Member Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.7, except as set
forth in Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 which shall be applicable to such
claims, no party shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes of
action or remedies against another Person if and to the extent Fraud is proven
on the part of such Person with respect to any of the representations and
warranties made herein by such Person or in any schedule, exhibit or
certificate delivered hereto.

Section 10.8 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payments or deliveries of
Purchaser Common Stock made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement
(with the exception of payments made to indemnify Purchaser in respect of any
liability under Section 116 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any applicable
analogous provisions under the Laws of any province of Canada) shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Transaction Consideration for Tax purposes to
the extent permitted by Law.

Section 10.9 Power of Sellers' Designee. Without limiting the foregoing, for
purposes of each of Section 10.4 and Section 10.5, (i) if any or all Sellers
comprise the Indemnifying Party, any references to the Indemnifying Party
(except provisions relating to an obligation to make any payments) shall be
deemed to refer to the Sellers' Designee, and (ii) if any or all Sellers
comprise the Indemnified Party, any references to the Indemnified Party
(except provisions relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers' Designee. 

ARTICLE XI 
TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Sellers' Designee and Purchaser;

(b) by Sellers' Designee, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, if
any court or other Governmental Entity shall have issued, enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced any Law or Order (that is final and non‑appealable and
has not been vacated, withdrawn or overturned) permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 11.1(b) shall not be available to the party seeking to terminate
if such party is in breach of its representations or warranties or obligations
under this Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth
in ARTICLE VIII;

(c) by Sellers' Designee, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to 11:59 p.m. New York City
Time on April 18, 2016 (as such date may be automatically extended pursuant to
this Section 11.1(c), the "End Date"); provided, however that if at such time
the conditions set forth Section 8.1(a) (as a result of a judgment, decree,
order, restraint or injunction arising under any Antitrust Law) or Section
8.1(b) shall not have been satisfied, the End Date shall automatically be
extended to 11:59 p.m. New York City Time on July 18, 2016 and, solely in the
case of such extension, from and after such extension, any reference to the
End Date in any other provision of this Agreement shall be a reference to the
End Date as so extended; provided that no party may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1(c) if the failure of such party to perform or
comply with any of its covenants or obligations under this Agreement has been
the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to have
occurred on or before the End Date; provided, further, that Purchaser shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.1(c) for an additional 90 days following the End Date in the event that (i)
Sellers have initiated proceedings for specific enforcement of this Agreement
to the extent permitted by Section 12.12 prior to the End Date and (ii) such
proceedings are still pending; and provided, further, that in the event that
the Marketing Period has commenced, but Closing has not yet occurred, then the
End Date shall automatically be extended to the date that is two Business Days
following the then scheduled end date for the Marketing Period;

(d) by Sellers' Designee, if: (i) any of the representations and warranties of
Purchaser contained in ARTICLE VI shall fail to be true and correct or (ii)
there shall be a breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser
in this Agreement that, in either case of clause (i) or (ii), (A) would result
in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 

8.3(b) and (B) is not curable or, if curable, is not cured upon the occurrence
of the earlier of (1) the thirtieth (30th) day after written notice thereof
specifying such breach in reasonable detail is given by Sellers' Designee to
Purchaser and (2) the day that is five (5) Business Days prior to the End
Date; provided, that Sellers' Designee may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1(d) if the Company, Blocker or any Seller is in
breach of its representations or warranties or obligations under this
Agreement, which breach would result in the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b);

(e) by Purchaser, if: (i) any of the representations and warranties of any
Seller contained in ARTICLE III, or the representations and warranties of the
Blocker contained in ARTICLE IV or the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in ARTICLE V shall fail to be true and correct or (ii) there
shall be a breach by any Seller, the Blocker or the Company of any covenant or
agreement of any Seller, the Blocker or the Company in this Agreement that, in
either case of clause (i) or (ii), (A) would result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(b) and (B) is not curable
or, if curable, is not cured upon the occurrence of the earlier of (1) the
thirtieth (30th) day after written notice thereof specifying such breach in
reasonable detail is given by Purchaser to such Seller, the Blocker or the
Company and (2) the day that is five (5) Business Days prior to the End Date;
provided, that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.1(e) if Purchaser is in breach of its representations or warranties
or obligations under this Agreement, which breach would result in the failure
of a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b); or

(f) by Sellers' Designee, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section
8.1 and Section 8.2 have been satisfied or waived at the time the Closing was
required to occur pursuant to Section 2.4 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions
are reasonably capable of being satisfied), (ii) Sellers' Designee has
irrevocably confirmed by notice to Purchaser that all conditions set forth in
Section 8.3 have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied) or that it is willing to waive any
unsatisfied conditions in Section 8.3 and (iii) Purchaser has failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the end of the
second Business Day following the delivery of such notice.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of clause (b)
through (f) of this Section 11.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other parties hereto in accordance with Section 12.3 specifying the
provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected
with any notice of termination delivered by Sellers' Designee being deemed a
notice of termination by and on behalf of each other Seller, the Blocker and
the Company. 

Section 11.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement (i) by Sellers' Designee
or by Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.1(c) (if at the time of such
termination Sellers' Designee was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(f)) or (ii) by Seller's Designee
pursuant to Section 11.1(d) or Section 11.1(f), Purchaser shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to Sellers, as Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy, a termination
fee in the amount of forty-five million Dollars ($45,000,000) (the "Financing
Termination Payment") without offset or deduction of any kind, concurrently
with such termination (in the case of termination by Purchaser) or within two
(2) Business Days following such termination (in the case of termination by
Sellers' Designee) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to the
last sentence of Section 11.2(f), if the Financing Termination Payment is paid
following the termination of this Agreement, such payment shall constitute
liquidated damages and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Seller Related Parties against Purchaser or any of its direct or indirect,
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the "Purchaser Related Parties") for all Damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated under the circumstances contemplated by Section 11.1(d) or Section
11.1(f), and none of the Purchaser Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) In the event that (i)(x)(1) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or
Sellers' Designee pursuant to and in accordance with Section 11.1(c) (in the
case of termination by Purchaser, only under circumstances in which the
Sellers' Designee has a concurrent right to terminate pursuant to Section
11.1(c)) or (2) this Agreement is terminated by Sellers' Designee pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 11.1(d) as a result of a breach of Section 7.6,
(y) at the time of such termination the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(c)
and Section 8.2 would have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by the
taking of an act or delivery of a document at the Closing but subject to such
conditions being capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date
of termination) and (z) the condition set forth in (1) Section 8.1(a) has not
been satisfied as a result of a Law or Order arising under any Antitrust Law
or (2) the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(b) have not been satisfied or
(ii)(x) this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser or Sellers' Designee
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 11.1(b), (y) at the time of such
termination the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(c) and Section 8.2 would
have been satisfied if the Closing were to have occurred (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by the taking of an act or
delivery of a document at the Closing but subject to such conditions being
capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of termination),
and (z) at the time of such termination, the condition set forth in Section
8.1(a) has not been satisfied as a result of a Law or Order arising under any
Antitrust 

Law, then concurrently with such termination (in the case of termination by
Purchaser) or within two (2) Business Days following such termination (in the
case of termination by Sellers' Designee), Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid to Sellers' Designee, as the Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy, a
termination fee in the amount of seventy million Dollars ($70,000,000) (the
"Regulatory Termination Payment" and each of the Financing Termination Payment
and the Regulatory Termination Payment, a "Termination Payment"), by wire
transfer of same day funds; provided, however, that the Regulatory Termination
Payment shall not be payable if (i) the sole cause of the condition set forth
in Section 8.1(b) not being satisfied is that the waiting period under the HSR
Act related to any filing by any Seller with respect to its acquisition of
Purchaser Common Stock has not expired or been terminated and (ii) the failure
of such waiting period to expire or terminate did not result from a breach of
this Agreement by Purchaser.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of a Termination Payment,
the Purchaser Related Parties shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever
and Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no remedies whatsoever against the
Purchaser Related Parties; provided, however, that the Termination Payment
shall only be payable in accordance with the terms of this Section 11.2.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no personal
liability whatsoever will attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by
any former, current or future director, officer, agent or employee of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, nor any former, current or future direct or
indirect holder of any equity interests or securities of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (whether such holder is a limited or general partner, member,
stockholder or otherwise), whether by the enforcement of any judgment or
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law.

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 11.2
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to promptly pay a Termination
Payment if and when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, Sellers'
Designee commences an Action that results in a judgment against Purchaser for
the Termination Payment, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers' Designee, together
with the Termination Payment, (i) interest on the Termination Payment (or any
unpaid portion thereof) from the date of termination of this Agreement at a
rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date of termination and (ii) any
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses of
enforcement) incurred by Sellers' Designee in connection with any such Action.

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall a party be
required to pay the Financing Termination Payment or the Regulatory
Termination Payment on more than one occasion or in combination with one
another. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, 

if both a Financing Termination Payment and a Regulatory Termination Payment
are payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.2(a) and Section 11.2(b),
Purchaser shall be required to pay the Regulatory Termination Payment.

(f) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.1 by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Sellers' Designee, on the other
hand, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other parties
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall be terminated and become void and have no effect, and
there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of any Seller, Purchaser,
the Blocker or the Company, except that Section 7.2 (Confidentiality), Section
7.9 (Public Announcements), Section 7.13 (Conflicts; Privileges), Section
7.14(e) (Financing), this Section 11.2, the relevant defined terms in ARTICLE
I and ARTICLE XII shall survive any termination of this Agreement (and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to
the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that upon such termination,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be automatically amended without any
further action by the parties thereto to extend the term of the
Confidentiality Agreement for a period of two (2) years following the date of
such termination). Nothing in this Section 11.2 shall relieve or release any
party to this Agreement of any liability or damages arising out of such
party's Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement, except that
Purchaser shall be relieved of any further liability on account of a Willful
Breach if (and only if) Sellers' Designee has elected to receive, and
Purchaser has paid to Sellers' Designee, a Termination Payment.

ARTICLE XII

contrary, any waiver to any provision that inures to the benefit of, and is

whatsoever (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by

Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers and directors, (solely in their respective
capacities as equityholders, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, and directors
of Purchaser, the Blocker or the Company, as the case may be), and each of
their respective successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and forever

capacity as an equityholder of the Company or the Blocker) and each of its
past, present or future direct or indirect equityholders, partners, members,
Affiliates or any of their respective direct or indirect officers, managers,
directors, employees, counsel and agents (solely in their respective
capacities as past, present or future direct or indirect equityholders,
partners, members, Affiliates or officers, managers, directors, employees,
counsel and agents of a direct or indirect equityholder of the Company or the
Blocker) (each, a "Seller Releasee") of, from and against any and all Actions,

of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, which such Purchaser

equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, officers, directors, and each of
their respective successors and assigns retain, and do not release, their
rights and interests under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or the Investor Rights

released hereunder.

hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section 12.6 shall be
void. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are

and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any amendment or

AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER(S) OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD
TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES THEREOF. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN
THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND ANY APPELLATE COURT
THEREOF SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN

PARTY TO BRING, ANY SUCH CLAIM, SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT.

Section 12.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
contained in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory
policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions
contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term, provision, covenant or restriction or any
portion thereof had never been contained herein. Upon such a determination,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible
in a reasonably acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 12.12 Remedies.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached
and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event.
Accordingly, it is acknowledged and agreed by the parties hereto that each
party shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages,
including an injunction or injunctions or Orders for specific performance, to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including any Order
sought by any Seller to cause Purchaser to perform its agreements and
covenants contained in this Agreement to effect the Closing pursuant to
ARTICLE II hereof), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity as a remedy for any such 

breach or threatened breach except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2 and
this Section 12.12. Each party further agrees that no other party hereto or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 12.12(a), and each party hereto (i)
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument and (ii) agrees, subject to
the immediately succeeding sentence, to cooperate fully in any attempt by any
other party hereto in obtaining such equitable relief. Each party agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief in respect of a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement when available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the
grounds that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or that such
injunctive, specific performance or other equitable relief is not an
appropriate remedy at law or in equity. It is acknowledged and agreed that, in
the event of a failure of Purchaser to enforce the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter(s), Sellers shall be entitled to specific performance to
cause Purchaser to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter(s) (or any
financing agreements related thereto or to the Alternative Financing)
including by requiring Purchaser to bring an Action against the Debt Financing
Sources if the conditions to consummation of the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter have been satisfied and remain satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Seller Related
Party shall be entitled to specifically enforce the respective obligations of
the Purchaser to conduct the Closing or cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated unless: (i) all the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 would have been satisfied if the Closing
were to have occurred at the time the Closing was required to occur pursuant
to Section 2.4 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing (or, in
the case Alternative Financing has been obtained in accordance with Section
7.14, such Alternative Financing) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or would be funded in accordance with the terms thereof if the Closing
were to have occurred at such time, and (iii) the Sellers' Designee has
irrevocably confirmed to Purchaser in writing that if the Debt Financing (or
any Alternative Financing, if it has been obtained in accordance with Section
7.14) were funded, it would take such actions that are within its control to
cause the Closing to occur. The parties hereto agree that (i) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this Section 12.12(a), a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may
be available to a party under this Agreement and (ii) nothing set forth in
this Section 12.12 shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding
for specific performance under this Section 12.12 prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under ARTICLE XI (and pursuing monetary
damages, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, after such
termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to
this Section 12.12 or anything set forth in this Section 12.12 restrict or
limit any party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of ARTICLE XI or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may
be available then or thereafter. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection
with any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement
in this Agreement or the failure of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or
alleged to have been made in connection herewith, in each case, other than in
a circumstance in which the Sellers' Designee is permitted to receive a
Termination Payment pursuant to Section 11.2, the parties agrees that the
maximum aggregate monetary liability of Purchaser, if any, shall be limited to
an amount equal to the amount of the Financing Termination Payment, and in no
event shall any Seller Related Party seek to recover any money damages in
excess of such amount; provided that such limitation shall not apply in the
event of any Willful Breach by Purchaser of its covenants or obligations under
this Agreement unless Sellers' Designee has elected to receive, and Purchaser
has paid to Sellers' Designee, a Termination Payment following the termination
of this Agreement; provided further that Purchaser shall be obligated for any
of its indemnification obligations contained in ARTICLE X.

Section 12.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, AND AGREES TO CAUSE ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES
TO WAIVE, ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
DEBT FINANCING OR ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER(S),
ANY COMMITMENT LETTERS IN RESPECT OF ANY ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF).

Section 12.14 Non-Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, none of the Seller Related Parties shall have
any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source Related Party in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing, any Alternative Financing
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following consummation of
the Closing, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the
Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. No Debt Financing
Source Related Party shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive
or indirect damages or damages of a tortuous nature.

Section 12.15 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and have participated jointly in the drafting of this Agreement and,
therefore, waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

Section 12.16 Interpretation. The Disclosure Letters relate to and qualify
certain of the representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the
parties hereto in this Agreement and 

the Disclosure Letters are not intended to broaden or constitute, and shall
not be construed or otherwise be deemed to broaden or constitute, any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of any party hereto or any
other Person except to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement.
Matters reflected in the Disclosure Letters are not necessarily limited to
matters required by this Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Letters.
To the extent any such additional matters are included in the Disclosure
Letters, such additional matters are included for informational purposes and
do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. In no event
shall any disclosure of any such additional matters be deemed or interpreted
to broaden or otherwise amend any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations in this Agreement. To the extent that the Disclosure
Letters include brief descriptions or summaries of certain agreements and
instruments, such descriptions do not purport to be comprehensive, and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of the documents and
instruments described. Headings and subheadings have been inserted in the
Disclosure Letters for convenience of reference only and shall to no extent
have the effect of amending or changing the express description thereof as set
forth in this Agreement. Disclosure of any fact or item in this Agreement or
any Disclosure Letters referenced by a particular Section in this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to every other Section in
this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure that such disclosure would apply to such other Sections. Any
matter, condition or set of facts which is more specifically (rather than
generally or by implication) covered in any of the representations and
warranties of ARTICLE IV, ARTICLE V and ARTICLE VI shall be solely governed by
such more specific representation and warranty without reference to or
inclusion within a more generalized representation and warranty that but for
this sentence could be applicable to such matter, condition or set of facts.
No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in this Agreement or
the Disclosure Letters, Schedules, Annexes or Exhibits attached hereto shall
be construed as an admission, representation or indication that such item or
other matter is "material" or would have a Company Material Adverse Effect, a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, that such item or other matter would have a
material adverse effect on the ability of a Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, or that such item or other matter is required to be so
referred to or so disclosed. Each party may, at its option, include in its
Disclosure Letter items that are not material in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar amounts,
shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that such items
are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further
the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise. The
specification of any dollar amount or the inclusion of any item in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Letters, Schedules, Annexes or Exhibits attached hereto is not intended to
imply that those amounts, or higher or lower amounts, or the items so
included, or other items, are or are not required to be disclosed (including
whether such amounts or items are required to be disclosed as material or
threatened) or are within or outside of the Ordinary Course of Business, and
no party hereto shall use the fact of the setting of the 

amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in this Agreement or the
Disclosure Letters, Schedules, Annexes or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described or included in this Agreement or in any section of the
Disclosure Letters, Schedules, Annexes or Exhibits is or is not required to be
disclosed (including whether the amount or items are required to be disclosed
as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business for purposes of this Agreement. When used in reference to the
Blocker, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, the term "material"
shall be measured against the Blocker, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The information contained in this Agreement
and in the Disclosure Letters, Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement. No disclosure in any
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an admission by any Person to any
other Person of any matter whatsoever (including with respect to any possible
breach or violation of any Law, Order or Contract) and nothing in any
Disclosure Letter shall constitute an admission of any Liability or obligation
of any Person to any other Person or shall confer or give any Person any
remedy, claim, Liability, reimbursement, cause of action or any other right.
The parties hereto do not assume any responsibility to any Person that is not
a party to this Agreement for the accuracy of any information set forth in the
Disclosure Letters. The information set forth in the Disclosure Letters was
not prepared or disclosed with a view to its potential disclosure to others.
Subject to applicable Law, such information is disclosed in confidence for the
purposes contemplated in this Agreement and is subject to the confidentiality
provisions of any other agreements, including the Confidentiality Agreement,
entered into by the parties hereto or their Affiliates. Moreover, in
disclosing the information in the Disclosure Letters, each party hereto
expressly does not waive any attorney‑client privilege associated with such
information or any protection afforded by the work‑product doctrine with
respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed therein. Any attachments
to the Disclosure Letters form an integral part of the Disclosure Letters and
are incorporated by reference for all purposes as if set forth in the
Disclosure Letters.
