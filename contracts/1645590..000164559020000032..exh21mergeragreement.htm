1.3Effect on Capital Stock, Options, Warrants and RSUs

(a)Treatment of Company Capital Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants and
Company RSUs. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any party hereto, Company Stockholder, Company Optionholder, Company
Warrantholder, Company RSU Holder or any other Person:

(i)Company Capital Stock. Each share of Company Capital Stock held by a
Converting Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, on an
as-converted to Company Common Stock basis and after giving effect to any
exercise of Company Options or Company Warrants and settlement of Company RSUs
prior to the Effective Time, including any such settlement pursuant to Section
1.3(a)(iv), but excluding any Dissenting Shares and shares that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock) shall be extinguished and cancelled and
converted automatically into, and represent only, the right to receive,
without interest and less any applicable and required Tax withholding, (A) an
amount in cash equal to the Closing Per Share Consideration and (B) the Future
Per Share Consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of Article VIII.

(ii)Company Options.

(A)Each Vested Company Option that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to Section 1.6)
shall be terminated and cancelled at the Effective Time and shall not be
assumed by Acquirer. Upon cancellation thereof, each Vested Company Option
shall be converted into and represent the right to receive, without interest,
with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Vested
Company Option, (1) the Closing Per Option Consideration, and (2) the Future
Per Option Consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of Article VIII.
The amount of cash each Converting Holder holding Vested Company Options is entitled to receive
for such Vested Company Options shall be rounded down to the nearest cent and
will be reduced by any applicable payroll, income tax or other withholding
Taxes. Any Vested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that has a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the
Per Share Consideration shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof or payment of any cash or other property or consideration
therefor. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no
portion of the Future Per Option Consideration with respect to a Vested
Company Option shall be payable after the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date (unless otherwise permitted by Section 409A of the Code).

(B)Each Unvested Company Option held by a Continuing Employee that is
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than Performance Options, shall, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, be converted into and become an option
with respect to Acquirer Common Stock, and Acquirer shall assume each such
Unvested Company Option, in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity
Plans and/or stock option agreement by which it is evidenced (including the
vesting schedule and any vesting acceleration for each such Unvested Company
Option, to the extent applicable), except that from and after the Effective
Time: (1) Acquirer and its compensation committee shall be substituted for the
Company and the Board, or such committee of the Board delegated authorization
for, administering such Company Equity Plans, (2) each Unvested Company Option
assumed by Acquirer pursuant to the terms herein shall not include an "early
exercise" provision, regardless of whether the original Unvested Company
Option included an "early exercise" provision, (3) each Unvested Company
Option assumed by Acquirer may be exercised solely for shares of Acquirer
Common Stock (or cash, if so provided under the terms of such Unvested Company
Option or required or necessary for compliance reasons under Applicable Law),
(4) the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock subject to each Unvested
Company Option assumed by Acquirer shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole share and (5) the per share exercise price under each such
Unvested Company Option assumed by Acquirer shall be adjusted by dividing the
per share exercise price under each such Unvested Company Option by the
Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent; provided that with respect
to any Unvested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that has a per share exercise price equal to or exceeding the Per Share
Consideration, such Unvested Company Option shall not be assumed by Acquirer
and shall automatically terminate as of the Effective Time. In addition, it is
intended that each such Unvested Company Option that is an "incentive stock
option" immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an incentive
stock option under Section 422 of the Code and along with each nonqualified
stock option shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code and
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, so as not to
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option, within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations under
Section 409A of the Code, or otherwise result in adverse tax treatment or
penalties under Section 424 of the Code or Section 409A of the Code, and
clauses (4) and (5) of the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a)(ii)(B) shall
be modified to the extent necessary to ensure such compliance.

(C)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Acquirer will not assume
(1) Unvested Company Options held by Non-Continuing Employees or (2) Unvested
Company Options that are Performance Options. All such Unvested Company
Options that are unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time without any present or future
right to receive any portion of the Total Consideration.

(iii)Company Warrants. Each Company Warrant that is unexpired, unexercised and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be terminated and
cancelled at the Effective Time and shall not be assumed by Acquirer. Upon
cancellation thereof, each Company Warrant shall be converted into and
represent the right to receive, without interest, with respect to each share
of Company Capital Stock underlying such Company Warrant, (A) an amount in
cash equal to the Closing Per Warrant Consideration, and (B) the Future Per
Warrant Consideration, subject to the terms and conditions of Article VIII.
The amount of cash each Converting Holder holding Company Warrants is entitled
to receive for such Company Warrants shall be rounded down to the nearest cent
and will be reduced by any applicable payroll, income tax or other withholding
Taxes. Any Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that have an exercise price exceeding the Per Share Consideration shall
be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any
cash or other property or consideration therefor.

(iv)Company RSUs.

(A)Company RSUs other than Excess Promised Option RSUs. Each Company RSU
(excluding Excess Promised Option RSUs, which shall be treated as set forth
below) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with its terms and shall
be settled immediately upon such vesting. Each share of Company Common Stock
received in settlement of a Company RSU shall be treated as an outstanding
share of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
for purposes of this Agreement, including Section 1.3(a)(i). Any amounts due
in respect of such Company RSUs, including any applicable and required income
or employment Tax withholding, shall be automatically deducted without further
action of the Company RSU Holder from amounts otherwise payable to such
Company RSU Holder on the Closing Date. All such Company RSUs shall be taxed
in full at the time of such settlement.

(B)Excess Promised Option RSUs. Each Excess Promised Option RSU held by a
Continuing Employee that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, be converted into and become a restricted stock unit with respect
to Acquirer Common Stock, and Acquirer shall assume each such Excess Promised
Option RSU, in accordance with the terms of the Company's 2014 Equity
Incentive Plan and/or restricted stock unit agreement by which it is evidenced
(including the vesting schedule and any vesting acceleration for each such
Excess Promised Option RSU, to the extent applicable), except that from and
after the Effective Time: (i) Acquirer and its compensation committee shall be
substituted for the Company and the Board, or such committee of the Board
delegated authorization for, administering such Company Equity Plans, (ii)
each Excess Promised Option RSU assumed by Acquirer pursuant to the terms
herein may be settled solely in shares of Acquirer Common Stock, and (iii) the
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock subject to each Excess Promised
Option RSU assumed by Acquirer shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Excess Promised Option RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Acquirer will not assume Excess Promised Option RSUs held by
Non-Continuing Employees. All such Excess Promised Option RSUs held by Non-
Continuing Employees, if any, that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished at
the Effective Time without any present or future right to receive any portion
of the Total Consideration.

(b)Treatment of Retention RSUs. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of any party hereto, Retention RSU Holder or any other
Person, each Retention RSU held by a Continuing Employee that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, be converted into and become a
restricted stock unit with respect to Acquirer Common Stock, and Acquirer
shall assume each such Retention RSU, in accordance with the terms of the
Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and/or restricted stock unit agreement by
which it is evidenced (including the vesting schedule and any vesting
acceleration for each such Retention RSU, to the extent applicable), except
that from and after the Effective Time: (i) Acquirer and its compensation
committee shall be substituted for the Company and the Board, or such
committee of the Board delegated authorization for, administering such Company
Equity Plans, (ii) each Retention RSU assumed by Acquirer pursuant to the
terms herein may be settled solely in shares of Acquirer Common Stock, and
(iii) the number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock subject to each Retention
RSU assumed by Acquirer shall be equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each such Retention RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest
whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Acquirer will
not assume Retention RSUs held by Non-Continuing Employees. All such Retention
RSUs held by Non-Continuing Employees that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective
Time without any present or future right to receive any consideration. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consideration payable in respect of the Retention RSUs
shall not be deemed a portion of the Total Consideration and shall have no
impact on the calculation of the Per Share Consideration, Per Option
Consideration or Per Warrant Consideration.

(c)Treatment of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or payment of any cash or other
property or consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(d)Treatment of Merger Sub Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquirer, Merger Sub or any
other Person, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (and the
shares of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub
capital stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporation's capital stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after
the Effective Time). From and after the Effective Time, each certificate
evidencing ownership of a number of shares of Merger Sub capital stock will
evidence ownership of such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(e)Adjustments. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Capital
Stock or Acquirer Common Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to
the Effective Time, all references herein to specified numbers of shares of
any class or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that
are based upon numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby,
shall be equitably adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

(f)Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Closing Per Share Consideration and the Future Per Share Consideration but
shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
the DGCL or the California Corporations Code, as applicable ("CCC"). Each
holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the DGCL or CCC, to the extent
applicable, becomes entitled to payment thereunder for such shares shall
receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL or CCC, to the extent
applicable (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the Effective Time,
any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any
such shares shall immediately be deemed to have converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Closing Per Share Consideration and the
Future Per Share Consideration as if such shares never had been Dissenting
Shares, and Acquirer shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver to the holder
thereof, subject to compliance with Section 1.4, the applicable portion of the
Closing Payment as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The
Company or the Stockholders' Agent shall provide to Acquirer (i) prompt notice
of any demands for appraisal or purchase received by the Company or the
Stockholders' Agent, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
related to such demands served pursuant to the DGCL or CCC, to the extent
applicable, and received by the Company and (ii) the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL or
CCC, to the extent applicable. The Company (prior to the Effective Time) or
the Stockholders' Agent (after the Effective Time), as applicable, shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Acquirer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or as otherwise required under
the DGCL or CCC, to the extent applicable, voluntarily make any payment or
offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares. Subject to Section 8.2,
the payout of consideration under this Agreement to the Converting Holders
(other than in respect of Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated as
provided in this Section 1.3(f) and under the DGCL or CCC, to the extent
applicable) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of
appraisal rights or dissenters' rights under the DGCL or CCC, to the extent
applicable, by any other Company Stockholder.

(g)Rights Not Transferable. The rights of the Company Securityholders under
this Agreement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to
each such Company Securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason,
other than by operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution
without action taken by or on behalf of such Company Securityholder. Any
attempted transfer of such right by any holder thereof (other than as
permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void.

(h)No Interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
except as provided in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the cash amounts in
the Escrow Fund, no interest shall accumulate on any cash payable in
connection with the consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions.

1.4Payment Procedures

(a)Closing Payment Fund. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) after the Effective Time, Acquirer shall cause to
be deposited with Citibank, N.A. or other bank or trust company as Acquirer
and the Company may mutually agree (the "Paying Agent") in accordance with the
paying agent agreement between the Paying Agent and Acquirer, for the benefit of (i) the Company Stockholders, (ii) Company Optionholders holding
Vested Company Options and (iii) holders of outstanding Company Warrants, in
each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, cash in an amount
equal to (A) the Closing Payment minus (B) the aggregate Closing Per Option
Consideration payable to holders of Vested Company Options, who are subject to
income or employment Tax withholding by Acquirer or the Company (which will be
paid in accordance with Section 1.4(c)(i)) (the "Closing Payment Fund"). Any
earnings from investment of the Closing Payment Fund accruing pending
disbursement shall be the sole and exclusive property of Acquirer and no part
of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of any Converting Holders.

(b)Surrender of Certificates.

(i)As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) after the Effective Time, to the extent not previously delivered,
Acquirer shall, or shall cause the Paying Agent to, mail or e-mail a letter of
transmittal in customary form together with instructions for use thereof in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit H (the "Letter of Transmittal") to every
holder of record of Company Capital Stock that was issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (to their addresses set forth opposite
such holder's name on the Spreadsheet). The Letter of Transmittal shall
specify that delivery of the certificates or instruments that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding Company Capital
Stock (the "Certificates"), if any, shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt thereof by the Paying
Agent (or, in the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
compliance with Section 1.4(b)(iii)), together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal, duly executed on behalf of each Person
effecting the surrender of such Certificates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any Company Stockholder holding shares
in book-entry form only, as set forth on the Spreadsheet (the "Book-Entry
Shares") shall not be required to deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent to
receive his, her or its portion of the Closing Payment.

(ii)Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and any other documentation required thereby
(including any required tax forms), together with, in the case of shares of
Company Capital Stock that are not Book-Entry Shares, a Certificate, (A) such
Certificate, if applicable, shall be cancelled and (B) as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of such delivery, the holder of record of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive from the Paying
Agent (by check or wire transfer of same-day funds) such holder's portion of
the Closing Payment (less any applicable Tax withholding).

(iii)If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by a Converting Holder claiming such
document to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent,
the payment of any reasonable fees and the posting by such Converting Holder
of a bond in such reasonable amounts as the Paying Agent may require as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
document, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed document such Converting Holder's portion of the Closing Payment.

(c)Surrender of Company Options.

(i)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any
event on or prior to the earlier of 30 days following the Closing and December
31st of the year of the Closing), the Surviving Corporation, at the direction
of Acquirer, shall cause the aggregate Closing Per Option Consideration in respect of Vested Company Options held by Company
Optionholders who are subject to income or employment Tax withholding by
Acquirer or the Company to be paid to such Company Optionholders through the
Surviving Corporation's payroll system and in accordance with standard payroll
practices (including withholding for applicable Taxes).

(ii)As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, to the extent not previously
delivered, Acquirer shall, or shall cause the Paying Agent to, mail or e-mail,
to each holder of Vested Company Options as of the Effective Time, who is not
subject to income or employment Tax withholding by Acquirer or the Company and
who is to receive his or her portion of the Closing Payment from the Paying
Agent, a Letter of Transmittal to the address set forth opposite such holder's
name on the Spreadsheet. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of
delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal and any other documentation required thereby (including any
required tax forms), the holder of record of such Vested Company Options shall
be entitled to receive from the Paying Agent (by check or wire transfer of
same-day funds) such holder's portion of the Closing Payment (less any
applicable Tax withholding).

(d)Surrender of Company Warrants. As soon as reasonably practicable after (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the Effective Time, to the
extent not previously delivered, Acquirer shall, or shall cause the Paying
Agent to, to each holder of Company Warrants as of the Effective Time a Letter
of Transmittal to the address set forth opposite such holder's name on the
Spreadsheet. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of delivery to
the Paying Agent of a properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and any other documentation required thereby (including any
required tax forms), the holder of record of such Company Warrants shall be
entitled to receive from the Paying Agent (by check or wire transfer of same-
day funds) such holder's portion of the Closing Payment (less any applicable
Tax withholding).

(e)Escrow Amount. Acquirer shall deposit the Escrow Amount with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to Section 8.1. The Escrow Fund shall constitute partial
security for the benefit of Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other
Indemnified Person) with respect to any indemnification obligations of the
Converting Holders under Article VIII, and shall be held and distributed in
accordance with Section 8.1. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall constitute, among other
things, approval of the deposit of the Escrow Amount and the appointment of
the Stockholders' Agent. The Parties agree that, for Tax reporting purposes,
(1) the Acquirer shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Fund, and all
interest and other income earned on the Escrow Fund shall be reported as
having been earned by Acquirer, whether or not such income was disbursed
during such calendar year until the distribution of the Escrow Amount (or
portions thereof) is determined, and (2) (a) the Escrow Amount (other than the
portion deposited with respect to holders of Vested Company Options) shall
qualify for installment sale reporting under Section 453 of the Code and (b)
the portion of the Escrow Amount deposited with respect to holders of Vested
Company Options shall not be compensation or wages, or subject to withholding
as such, unless and until such amount (or any part thereof) is paid to the
former holders of such Vested Company Options, and no party hereto shall take
any action or filing position inconsistent with such characterizations. At the
end of September 2020 and each calendar quarter thereafter, and immediately
before the final distribution of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall
promptly transfer to Acquirer by wire transfer of immediately available funds
an amount equal to the product of 21% multiplied by the amount of accrued
interest or income earned on the Escrow Fund since the last payment date under
this Section 1.4(e). (f)Expense Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other
provisions of this Article I, Acquirer shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) the amount of the Expense Fund with the Stockholders' Agent
pursuant to Section 8.7(d). The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of
the Merger by the Company Stockholders shall constitute, among other things,
approval of the deposit of the Expense Fund by the Converting Holders. The
parties agree that, for Tax reporting purposes, the Converting Holders shall
be treated as the owner of the Expense Fund and the Expense Fund shall not
earn any interest or other income.

(g)Transfers of Ownership. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.3(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate, Book-Entry Shares, Company Option or Company Warrant surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the payment
thereof that such Certificate, Book-Entry Shares, Company Option or Company
Warrant shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Acquirer or
any agent designated by Acquirer any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment of cash in any name other than that of the registered
holder of such Certificate, Book-Entry Shares, Company Option or Company
Warrant, or established to the satisfaction of Acquirer or any agent
designated by Acquirer that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(h)Distribution of Future Payments. After the Closing, if and only if an
amount is released from the Escrow Fund or the Expense Fund pursuant to
Article VIII, in each case, to the Converting Holders, then Acquirer, the
Escrow Agent or the Stockholders' Agent, as applicable, shall deposit with the
Paying Agent such released amount in accordance with the paying agent
agreement, for payment through the Paying Agent for further distribution to
the Converting Holders (or, in the case of former Company Optionholders
holding Vested Company Options who are subject to income or employment Tax
withholding by Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation, through Acquirer's or
the Surviving Corporation's payroll system) in accordance with each Converting
Holder's Pro Rata Share. Any earnings from investment of such released amounts
accruing pending disbursement shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Acquirer and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of the
Converting Holders.

(i)Unclaimed Consideration. Each holder of a Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or
document or instrument representing a Company Option or Company Warrant who
has not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures set forth in and
contemplated by this Section 1.4 shall look only to Acquirer (subject to
abandoned property, escheat and similar Applicable Law) for such holder's
claim, only as a general unsecured creditor of Acquirer, to any portion of the
Total Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such
Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or document or instrument representing a
Company Option or Company Warrant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if any Certificate has not been surrendered or Letter of
Transmittal has not been delivered in accordance with the terms of this
Section 1.4 prior to the earlier of (1) the first anniversary of the Effective
Time and (2) such date on which the applicable portion of the Closing Payment
payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) in respect of such Certificate, Book-Entry
Shares or document or instrument representing a Company Option or Company
Warrant would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity, any amounts payable in respect of such Certificate, Book-
Entry Shares or document or instrument representing a Company Option or
Company Warrant shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Acquirer, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto. (j)No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.4,
no party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Applicable Law.

1.5No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock, Company Options,
Company Warrants, Company RSUs or Retention RSUs

exchange of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares, Vested Company Options,
Company RSUs (other than Excess Promised Option RSUs) and Company Warrants in
accordance with this Agreement shall be paid or payable in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or issuable pursuant to such Vested

transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock, Vested Company Options, Company RSUs (other than Excess

Certificate, Book-Entry Shares or document or instrument representing a Vested
Company Option, a Company RSU (other than Excess Promised Option RSUs) or a
Company Warrant is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such
Certificate, Book-Entry Shares, document or instrument (and the underlying
shares of Company Common Stock, Vested Company Options, Company RSUs (other
than Excess Promised Option RSUs) and Company Warrants) shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

(b)The conversion into stock options with respect to Acquirer Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(ii)(B) shall be in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock issuable pursuant to
Unvested Company Options, and the conversion into restricted stock units with
respect to Acquirer Common Stock pursuant to Sections 1.3(a)(iv)(B) and 1.3(b)
shall be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Capital Stock issuable pursuant to Retention RSUs and Excess Promised
Option RSUs, if any, respectively, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of any Unvested
Company Option, Excess Promised Option RSU or Retention RSU that was issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the

Option, Excess Promised Option RSU or Retention RSU is presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, such document or instrument (and the
underlying Unvested Company Option, Excess Promised Option RSUs or Retention
RSUs) shall be cancelled and converted as provided in Section 1.3(b).

Acquirer shall provide proof of such deducted and withheld amounts to such
Persons.

1.10Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. If, at any time after the
Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and possession of, all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action

regarding the matter disclosed), the Company represents and warrants to
Acquirer as follows:

activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary to the Business of
the Company or its applicable Subsidiary, except where the failure to be so

with any other such failures, would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. Schedule 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets

Company Balance Sheet Date and before the Closing Date (i) arose or shall
arise in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
(ii) represented or shall represent bona fide claims against debtors for sales
and other charges. As of the Agreement Date, the Company has not received any
written notice from any debtor that such debtor does not intend to pay any
Accounts Receivable. As of the Agreement Date, none of the Accounts Receivable

of the assets of Company and the Subsidiaries and (iv) that the amount
recorded for assets on the books and records of the Company is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences. None of the Company, the Subsidiaries, the
Board, the Company\'s independent auditors or any officer of the Company, and,
to the actual knowledge (without any duty of inquiry) of the Company, any
other Representative of the Company or any Subsidiary, has identified or been
made aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Company\'s
management or other current or former employees, consultants or directors of
the Company or any Subsidiary who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the Company or the
Subsidiaries, or any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing. None

methodologies or methods of the Company or any Subsidiary or its internal
accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in the Company\'s financial

Company or any Subsidiary has reported in writing to the Board or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of the
Company\'s internal controls that would reasonably be expected to materially
and adversely affect the Company\'s ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data. There has been no material change in the Company
accounting policies between January 1, 2017 and the Agreement Date, except as
described in the Financial Statements. 2.5Absence of Changes. Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, (a) through the

(f), (p) and (q), actions in the ordinary course of business consistent with

a vesting arrangement or to other unvested property issued by the Company or
any Subsidiary to any of their respective current or former employees, non-
employee directors, consultants or other service providers. No payment to any
Company Securityholder of any amount payable pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) or
Section 1.3(a)(iii) will result in compensation or other income to any Company
Securityholder with respect to which Acquirer or the Company would be required
to deduct or withhold any Taxes. (w)Schedule 2.12(w) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all "nonqualified
deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code)
to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party. Each such nonqualified
deferred compensation plan to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
complies with the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of Section
409A(a) of the Code by its terms and has been operated in accordance with such
requirements. No event has occurred that would be treated by Section 409A(b)
of the Code as a transfer of property for purposes of Section 83 of the Code.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is under any obligation to pay, or pay
a gross-up bonus for, any Taxes under Section 409A of the Code.

(x)The Company has made available to Acquirer copies of all valuation reports
prepared for the Company by an independent valuation firm to determine the
fair market value of the stock of the Company for purposes of setting the
exercise price of stock options granted by the Company for purposes of
Sections 409A and 422 of the Code. The exercise price of all Company Options
is at least equal to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on the
date such Company Options were granted, and none of the Company, any
Subsidiary or Acquirer has incurred or will incur any Liability or obligation
to withhold Taxes under Section 409A of the Code upon the vesting of any
Company Options. All Company Options constitute "service recipient stock" (as
defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)) with respect to the
grantor thereof.

(y)The Company and each Subsidiary is in material compliance with Applicable
transfer pricing Laws and regulations, including the maintenance of
documentation sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Section
6662(e)(3)(B)(i)(II) of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign Applicable Law). The Company and its Subsidiaries are
in material compliance with all applicable country-by-country reporting
requirements under Section 1.6038-4 of the Treasury Regulations and any
similar provision of non-U.S. law.

(z)No independent contractor was or will be considered as an employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary by an applicable Tax Authority and/or Company
Employee Plan.

(aa)Except as set forth on Schedule 2.12(aa) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
current or former employee, non-employee director, consultant or other service
provider of the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to which the
Company and/or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company and/or any
Subsidiary or their respective assets is bound that, considered individually
or considered collectively with any other such agreements, plans, arrangements
or other Contracts, will, or would reasonably be expected to, as a result of
the Transactions (whether alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events), give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any
amount that would reasonably be expected to be non-deductible under Section
162 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law) or be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision
of state, local or foreign Tax law). Schedule 2.12(aa) of the Company
Disclosure Letter lists each Person (whether United States or foreign) who as
of the Closing will be, with respect to the Company, a "disqualified
individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined as of the Agreement Date.
No security of the Company or any Company Securityholder is readily tradable
on an established securities market or otherwise (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder) such that
the Company is ineligible to seek shareholder approval in a manner that
complies with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has ever had any obligation to report, to withhold or to pay (or
pay a gross-up bonus for) any excise Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code. (ab)Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has at any time been subject to (i)
a digital tax or other similar Tax in France, the United Kingdom or any other
jurisdiction which has enacted comparable legislation or (ii) the UK diverted
profits tax other similar Tax in any other jurisdiction which has enacted
comparable legislation, and no amounts received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in respect of the enjoyment or exercise of rights in respect of
intangible property is subject to Tax in the United Kingdom under the UK rules
on offshore payments in respect of intangible property or in any other
jurisdiction which has enacted comparable legislation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.12, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary makes any representation or warranty as to the
amount, condition or availability for use in any Post-Closing Tax Period, of
any net operating loss, tax credit carryforward or similar Tax attribute of
the Company or any Subsidiary.

2.13Employee Benefit Plans.

(a)Schedule 2.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists, with respect to
the Company, any Subsidiary and any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) that is treated as a single employer with the Company (an "ERISA
Affiliate") within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code,
(i) all "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (ii)
each loan to an employee, (iii) all stock option, stock purchase, phantom
stock, stock appreciation right, restricted stock unit, supplemental

employee relocation, cafeteria plan benefit (Section 125 of the Code),
dependent care (Section 129 of the Code), life insurance or accident insurance
plans, programs or arrangements, (iv) all bonus, pension, profit sharing,
savings, severance, retirement, deferred compensation or incentive plans
(including cash incentive plans), programs or arrangements, (v) all other
material fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements and (vi)
all employment, individual consulting, retention, change of control or
employee or executive compensation or severance agreements, written or
otherwise, as to which any unsatisfied obligations of the Company or any
Subsidiary remain for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former
employee, non-employee director, consultant or other service provider of the
Company or any Subsidiary, provided that for purposes of this clause (vi), the
Company shall not be required to separately list each of its and each
Subsidiary's individual standard offer letters that are currently in effect
that is on an employment agreement form already provided to Acquirer and set
forth on Schedule 2.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (all of the
foregoing described in clauses (i) through (vi), collectively, including any
Foreign Plans, the "Company Employee Plans").

(b)The Company has made available to Acquirer a true, correct and complete
copy of all material Company Employee Plans and related plan documents
(including trust documents, insurance policies or Contracts, employee
booklets, summary plan descriptions, summary of material modifications and
other authorizing documents, and any material employee communications relating
thereto) and has, with respect to each Company Employee Plan that is subject
to ERISA reporting requirements, made available to Acquirer true, correct and
complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for the last three plan years.
Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either obtained from the IRS a favorable determination letter as to
its qualified status under the Code, including all amendments to the Code
effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation, or has been
established under a standardized prototype plan for which an IRS opinion
letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting
employer. The Company has made available to Acquirer a true, correct and
complete copy of the most recent (as of the Agreement Date) IRS determination
or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan, and nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified
status of any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. All
individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Company Employee Plan, are
entitled to participate in any Company Employee Plan, are currently
participating in such Company Employee Plan or have been offered an
opportunity to do so and have declined in writing. All assets of any Company
Employee Plan that is a retirement plan consist solely of cash and actively
traded securities.

(c)Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary sponsors or maintains any self-
funded employee benefit plan, including any plan to which a stop-loss policy
applies. None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides post-
termination medical or other post-termination welfare benefits to any person,
and the Company has no obligation and has made no promise to provide such
benefits, other than as required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") or similar Applicable Law and
the Company and, to the extent applicable, each Subsidiary has, since January
1, 2015, complied in all material respects with the requirements of COBRA and
any applicable local country equivalent. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has any obligations to provide subsidized coverage under COBRA or
similar Applicable Law equivalent with respect to any former employees or
qualifying beneficiaries thereunder. Since January 1, 2015, there has been no
"prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code and not exempt under Section 408 of ERISA and
regulatory guidance thereunder) with respect to any Company Employee Plan.
Since January 1, 2015, (i) each Company Employee Plan has been administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations
(including ERISA and the Code), and (ii) the Company, each Subsidiary and each
ERISA Affiliate has performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by it under, is not in default under or in violation
of, and has no knowledge of any default or violation by any other party to,
any of the Company Employee Plans. None of the Company, any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate is subject to any Liability or penalty under Sections 4976
through 4980 of the Code, Section 4980B through 4980H of the Code or Title I
of ERISA with respect to any Company Employee Plans. All contributions
required to be made by the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to
any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before their due dates and a
reasonable amount has been accrued for contributions to each Company Employee
Plan for the current plan years (and no further contributions will be due or
will have accrued thereunder as of the Closing Date, other than contributions
accrued in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice after
the Company Balance Sheet Date as a result of the operations of the Company or
any Subsidiary after the Company Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with
respect to each Company Employee Plan intended to include a Code Section
401(k) arrangement, the Company, each Subsidiary and each of the ERISA
Affiliates have at all times made timely deposits of employee salary reduction
contributions and participant loan repayments, as determined pursuant to
regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor. No Company
Employee Plan is covered by, and none of the Company, any Subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate has incurred or expects to incur any Liability under Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Each Company Employee Plan
can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time
in accordance with its terms, without liability to Acquirer (other than
ordinary and reasonable administrative expenses typically incurred in a
termination event). With respect to each Company Employee Plan, since January
1, 2015, the Company, each applicable Subsidiary and any applicable ERISA
Affiliate have prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite
governmental reports (which were true, correct and complete as of the date
filed), including any required audit reports, and have properly and timely
filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required
to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Employee
Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding, action, litigation or claim has been
brought, or to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened in writing, against or with respect to any such Company
Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States
Department of Labor.

(d)There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company, any Subsidiary or other ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Company Employee Plan that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent full fiscal
year included in the Financial Statements.

(e)None of the Company, any Subsidiary or any current or former ERISA
Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to, or
has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or contributed
to, or has incurred or expects to incur any Liability with respect to any
pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is subject to
Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

(f)None of the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate is a party to,
or has made any contribution to, or has been required to make any contribution
to or otherwise incurred any obligation or Liability under, any "multiemployer
plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, any "multiple
employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the Code or local
country equivalent or any "multiple employer welfare plan" as such term is
defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA or similar Applicable Law.

(g)None of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Transactions, any termination of employment or service and
any other event in connection therewith or subsequent thereto will,
individually or together or with the occurrence of some other event (whether
contingent or otherwise), (i) result in any material payment or benefit
(including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due or payable, or required to be provided, to any current
or former employee, non-employee director, consultant or other service
provider of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) materially increase the amount
or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be
provided to any current or former employee, non-employee director, consultant
or other service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such
benefit or compensation, (iv) increase the amount of compensation due to any
current or former employee, non-employee director, consultant or other service
provider of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (v) result in the forgiveness in
whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the Company or any
Subsidiary to any current or former employee, non-employee director,
consultant or other service provider of the Company or any Subsidiary. No
amount paid or payable or benefit provided or to be provided by the Company or
any Subsidiary in connection with the Transactions, whether alone or in
combination with another event, will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or Section 4999 of the Code or will
not be deductible by the Company by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

(h)To the extent permitted to be disclosed pursuant to Applicable Law, each
Company Employee Plan maintained or contributed to by the Company or any
Subsidiary under the Applicable Law of a relevant jurisdiction outside of the
United States or covering employees of the Company working outside of the
United States (each such plan, a "Foreign Plan") is listed in Schedule 2.13(h)
of the Company Disclosure Letter. With respect to each Foreign Plan, (i) the
Company, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate has materially complied with
all applicable reporting and notice requirements, and such Foreign Plan has
obtained from the Governmental Entity having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Plan any required determinations
that such Foreign Plan is in compliance in all material respects with
Applicable Law, if such determinations are required in order to give effect to
such Foreign Plan, (ii) the consummation of the Transactions will not by
itself create or otherwise result in any liability with respect to such
Foreign Plan, (iii) except as required by Applicable Law, no condition exists
that would prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from terminating or amending
any Foreign Plan at any time for any reason in accordance with the terms of
each such Foreign Plan without the payment of any fees, costs or expenses
(other than the payment of benefits accrued on the Company Balance Sheet and
any normal and reasonable expenses typically incurred in a termination event).
No Foreign Plan has unfunded Liabilities that will not be offset by insurance
or that are not fully accrued on the financial statements of the Company. No
employee of the Company or any Subsidiary who is domiciled or, to the
knowledge of the Company, would properly be categorized as domiciled outside
of the United States (or any of their dependents) is entitled to any pension,
superannuation, retirement (including on early retirement) or death benefits
(including in the form of a lump sum) that become payable before their normal
retirement age as stated in their contract of employment or an applicable
Foreign Plan.

meetings or access to electronic files) that would not be subject to such
logistical restrictions or limitations) to afford Acquirer and its
Representatives reasonable access during business hours to (A) the Company's

legal privilege or (z) would be in violation of Applicable Law or regulations
of any Governmental Entity (including the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws) or

Company shall inform Acquirer of the general nature of the access or
information being withheld and, upon Acquirer's request, reasonably cooperate
with Acquirer to provide such access or information, in whole or in part, in a
manner that would not result in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing
clauses (x), (y) and (z). (b)Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, for the duration of the Pre-
Closing Period, the Company shall confer from time to time as reasonably

the Closing Payment to the Company promptly upon receipt thereof and (ii) in
consideration for such assignment and promise to pay, the Hughes Promissory

were waived under the corresponding Company Employee Plans in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) each Continuing Employee shall
receive credit for purposes of severance benefits, for purposes of eligibility
for any vacation, sick, and personal time off plans or programs and for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under a US 401(k) plan of Acquirer, the
Surviving Corporation or a relevant subsidiary, in each case for years of
service with the Company prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that (y)
such credit was recognized for the same purposes under the analogous Company
Employee Plan in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (z) such
credit does not result in the duplication of benefits or compensation for the
same period of service, and (iii) Acquirer shall cause each Continuing
Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such
Continuing Employee under any similar Company Employee Plan for the plan year
that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan maintained by

such entity), as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date

individual's offer letter. Each Promised Option RSU shall be converted into
restricted stock units with respect to Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.3(a)(iv)(B) and shall be settled in Acquirer Common Stock within 30
days following the date on which it vests pursuant to the foregoing schedule.

Promised Option RSU granted pursuant thereto is granted in lieu of and in full
satisfaction of any rights to any options promised by the Company to the

RSUs shall vest upon each quarterly anniversary of the Anniversary Date, until
the entire award of Retention RSUs shall have become fully vested by the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Retention
RSUs for the Holdback Participant shall be subject to the vesting schedule set

the foregoing schedule. The Post-Closing Cash Retention Awards shall vest
according to the same schedule as the Post-Closing Acquiror RSUs or a shorter
schedule as mutually agreed by Acquirer and the Company's Chief Executive
Officer.

(i)Nothing in this Section 5.9 or Section 5.10, whether express or implied,
shall (x) create any rights to continued employment or service, any term or
condition of employment or service with the Acquirer or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates or in any way prohibit Acquirer, its
Affiliates, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
of the foregoing from terminating the employment or service of any Continuing
Employee or any other Person at any time and for any or no reason, (y) be
construed as an establishment, termination or amendment of any Company
Employee Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
contract, agreement or arrangement, or prohibit Acquirer, its Affiliates, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
establishing, amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan or any other
benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, contract, agreement or
arrangement or (z) grant any rights or remedies whatsoever, including any
third party beneficiary rights, by reason of this Section 5.9 to any Person
other than the parties.

5.10.Termination of Benefit Plans.

(a)Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Company
shall terminate any Company Employee Plans intended to include a Section
401(k) arrangement (unless and to the extent that Acquirer provides written notice to the Company no
later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such plans shall
not be terminated). The Company shall provide Acquirer with evidence that such
Company Employee Plan(s) have been terminated (effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board
or any applicable committee thereof. The form and substance of such
resolutions shall be subject to the reasonable review of Acquirer. The Company
also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company
Employee Plan(s) as Acquirer may reasonably require. In the event that
termination of the Company's 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to
trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees (not in the
ordinary course of plan termination), then the Company shall reasonably
estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in
writing to Acquirer, which charges and/or fees shall be deemed Transaction
Expenses hereunder.

(b)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will make all required contributions
and pay all premiums required under each Company Benefit Plan which are due on
or before the Closing Date.

5.11.Company Closing Financial Certificate. The Company shall prepare and
deliver to Acquirer a draft of the Company Closing Financial Certificate not
later than six (6) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and a final version
of the Company Closing Financial Certificate to Acquirer not later than four
(4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In the event that Acquirer
notifies the Company that there are or may be errors in the drafts of the
Company Closing Financial Certificate, Acquirer and the Company shall discuss
such errors in good faith and the Company shall correct such errors to
Acquirer's reasonable satisfaction prior to delivering the final versions of
the same in accordance with this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing
or Section 5.7, the Company shall provide to Acquirer, together with the
Company Closing Financial Certificate, such supporting documentation,
information and calculations as are reasonably necessary for Acquirer to
verify and determine the calculations, amounts and other matters set forth in
the Company Closing Financial Certificate.

5.12.Tax Matters.

(a)Each of Acquirer, the Stockholders' Agent, the Company Securityholders and
the Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by any of the others, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any
Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon request therefor) the provision of records and information
reasonably relevant to any such Legal Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Acquirer, the Company, the
Stockholders' Agent and the Company Securityholders agree to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Tax Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have no obligation to prepare or file any Tax
Returns.

(b)The Company shall cause each Company Securityholder to further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the Transactions). (c)Acquirer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, any Tax Return required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect
to the Company and the Subsidiaries for a Taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period"). Such
Tax Returns, to the extent relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, except where otherwise required by Applicable Law
or, in respect of transactions between the Company and the Subsidiaries, where
required to conform to any updated transfer pricing analysis completed prior
to the due date of such Tax Return in a manner fully compliant with Applicable
Law relating to transfer pricing; provided that if such transfer pricing
analysis provides a range of margins, Acquirer shall use a margin which is not
higher than the middle of such range. The Company shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, any Tax Return required to be
filed before the Closing Date with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
the past practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries, as applicable, except
where otherwise required by Applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have no obligation to prepare or file any Tax
Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

(d)Without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Agent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or as required by
Applicable Law, Acquirer shall not, and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries not to make or change any Tax election or file an amended Tax
Return, in each case to the extent such Tax election or Tax Return is with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, that Acquirer may, and may
cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to, file an amended Tax Return in order
to utilize a carryback of an item from a Taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning on or after the day after the Closing Date (each a "Post-Closing Tax
Period"), to the extent such amended Tax Return would not reasonably be

Subsidiaries or the Company Securityholders. No election under Section 338 or
Section 336 of the Code shall be filed with respect to the Transactions.

(e)Acquirer shall with reasonable promptness notify the Stockholders' Agent
upon the receipt of any notice, or becoming aware, of any audit or other
similar examination with respect to Taxes for which the Converting Holders

Contest"). Acquirer shall control, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
control, the conduct of any Tax Contest; provided that if the Converting
Holders may be required to pay for any Indemnifiable Damages resulting from
such Tax Contest, Acquirer shall keep the Stockholders' Agent reasonably
informed of the progress of such Tax Contest to the extent it relates to a

Contest without first consulting with the Stockholders' Agent. Acquirer shall
consider the Stockholders' Agent comments to the Tax Contest in good faith.

Acquirer, along with the assumptions used to make the calculations and the
data necessary for Acquirer to confirm the accuracy of the calculations, (ii)
promptly seek via a parachute payment waiver, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Parachute Payment Waiver") the consent of
the recipient of any such payment that would otherwise be due and owing that
entitlement to such payment shall be waived, absent 280G Stockholder Approval
(as defined below) and (iii) promptly (and in any case prior to the Closing Date) cause all such payments to be adequately
disclosed to, and obtain the vote (whether of approval or disapproval) of, the

a manner reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer. Acquirer shall have the right to
reasonably review and approve any disclosure required by clause (iii) of the
first sentence of this Section 5.13 before such disclosure is made. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Acquirer notification and
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer that (i) the 280G
Stockholder Approval was obtained or (ii) the 280G Stockholder Approval was
not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall

Agreements. The Company shall seek and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts (including through the exercise of all available drag along or similar

Company Stockholders, Company Optionholders and Company Warrantholders,
respectively (other than those Company Stockholders who have already executed
and delivered a Written Consent).

5.15.Prohibited and Restricted Parties. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall cooperate in good faith with Acquirer to determine if any of the
Company's or Subsidiary's customers, partners, suppliers or employees are
Prohibited and Restricted Parties and if it is determined that the Company or
any Subsidiary is conducting business with any Prohibited and Restricted
Party, the Company or Subsidiary shall use reasonable best efforts to
terminate such business prior to the Closing.

5.16.Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a)If the Merger is consummated, for six years following the Closing, Acquirer
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor the obligations of
the Company to its officers and directors determined as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the "Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant to an
indemnification agreement with the Company (each, a "DandO Indemnification
Agreement") and pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (the
"Indemnity Provisions"), in each case, in effect as of the Agreement Date,
with respect to claims arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time that are asserted after the Effective Time.

(b)Acquirer acknowledges and agrees that the Company intends to, on or prior
to the Closing, purchase tail insurance coverage for the Company Indemnified
Parties (the "DandO Tail Policy"), which shall provide the Company Indemnified
Parties with coverage for six years following the Closing Date in an amount
not less than the existing coverage and that shall have other terms not
materially less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage maintained by the Company as of the
Agreement Date. Acquirer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the
DandO Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date.

indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have against Acquirer
or the Surviving Corporation first arising after the earlier of the Closing
Date and the termination of this Agreement by contract or otherwise, (iv)
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Acquirer and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, (v) shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Company Indemnified Party

Damages with respect to such matters without regard to the Threshold, subject
in all cases to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII.

in the first two sentences of Section 2.1(a) (Organization), Section 2.2
(Capital Structure), Section 2.3(a) (Authority and Enforceability), Section
2.12 (Taxes) (other than the Specified Tax Representations), the last sentence

(Transaction Fees), or (B) the Company in any certificate delivered to
Acquirer pursuant to this Agreement that are within the scope of those covered
by the foregoing Sections (collectively, the "Special Representations") to be
true and correct as aforesaid.

(c)In the case of any claims for Indemnifiable Damages if and to the extent
resulting, directly or indirectly, from the failure of any of the Special
Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or the matters listed in clauses (ii) through (viii) of
Section 8.2(a) (collectively, "Special Claims"), after Indemnified Persons
have exhausted or made claims upon all amounts of cash held in the Escrow Fund
(after taking into account all other claims for indemnification, compensation
and reimbursement from the Escrow Fund made by Indemnified Persons) which will
be the first source of recovery for all Indemnifiable Damages hereunder, or
following the applicable Escrow Release Date or the depletion of the Escrow
Fund, each Converting Holder shall have liability pursuant to the terms and
conditions of this Article VIII for such Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of
the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages if and to the extent resulting,
directly or indirectly, therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, (i) the total liability of a Converting Holder for Special
Claims (in addition to claims that were otherwise made against the Escrow
Fund) shall be limited to the aggregate amount of cash received by such
Converting Holder pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger (it being
understood that amounts deposited into the Escrow Fund and the Expense Fund
shall be deemed received by the Converting Holders for purposes of calculation
of the total liability hereunder) and (ii) any limitation of liability with
respect to an Converting Holder in this Section 8.3(c) shall not apply in the
case of Fraud actually committed by such Converting Holder under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which such Converting Holder is
a party.

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

i.no Converting Holder (based upon such Converting Holder's position as an
officer, director, employee or agent of the Company or otherwise) shall have
(a) any right of indemnification, contribution or right of advancement from
Acquirer, the Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnified Person or (b) any
right of subrogation against the Company or the Surviving Corporation, in the
case of both (a) and (b), with respect to its Pro Rata Share of the
Indemnifiable Damages claimed by an Indemnified Person by reason of any of the
matters set forth in Section 8.2(a);

ii.the rights and remedies of the Indemnified Persons after the Effective Time
shall not be limited by (A) any investigation by or on behalf of, or
disclosure to (other than any disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter with
respect to clause (i) of Section 8.2(a), subject to any limitations expressly
set forth in the opening paragraph of Article II), any Indemnified Person at
or prior to the Effective Time regarding any failure, breach or other event or
circumstance or (B) any waiver of any condition to the Closing related
thereto;

iii.if an Indemnified Person's claim under this Article VIII may be properly
characterized in multiple ways in accordance with this Article VIII such that
such claim may or may not be subject to different limitations depending on
such characterization, then such Indemnified Person shall have the right to
characterize such claim in a manner that maximizes the recovery and time to
assert such claim permitted in accordance with this Article VIII; provided
that an Indemnified Person shall not be entitled to double recovery for any
Indemnifiable Damages even though such Indemnifiable Damages may have resulted
from the breach of one or more representations, warranties or covenants in
this Agreement;

iv.no Converting Holder shall be liable for any Indemnifiable Damages
resulting from any reduction in amount or unavailability of any net operating
loss, tax credit or other tax attribute of the Company arising from (A) a
breach by Acquirer or Merger Sub of a provision in this Agreement or (B) any
action taken after the Effective Time by the Acquirer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation); and v.no amount of Taxes (other than income, franchise or other similar Taxes
imposed on net or gross income, profits or gains of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) shall be subject to indemnification under clauses (i) and (vi)
of Section 8.2(a) unless and until the total amount of all such Taxes exceeds
an amount equal the Pre-Closing Operating Tax Amount; provided that there will
be no indemnification under this Agreement for Taxes that could have been
reduced (to the extent of such reduction) or avoided by utilizing the
Company's net operating losses, capital losses or any other of its tax
attributes (for clarity, not including any net operating losses, capital
losses or any other of its tax attributes arising in a Post-Closing Tax
Period).

(e)All Indemnifiable Damages shall be calculated net of the amount of any
actual recoveries actually received by an Indemnified Person from an unrelated
third party insurer prior to the Escrow Release Date under any existing
insurance policies and contractual indemnification or contribution provisions
(in each case, calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves,
expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or retrospectively rated premiums
(as determined in good faith by an Indemnified Person) incurred or paid to
procure such recoveries) in respect of any Indemnifiable Damages suffered,
paid, sustained or incurred by any Indemnified Person; provided that no
Indemnified Person shall have any obligation to seek to obtain or continue to
pursue any such recoveries. If an Indemnified Person actually receives any
amounts under applicable insurance policies or third party indemnification or
reimbursement payments subsequent to its receipt of an indemnification payment
by the Converting Holders (including via the Escrow Fund), then such
Indemnified Person will, without duplication, promptly reimburse the
Converting Holders (including via the Escrow Fund) for any payment made by
such Converting Holders (including via the Escrow Fund) up to the amount
actually received by the Indemnified Person (net of any actual collection
costs and reserves, expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or
retrospectively rated premiums (as determined in good faith by an Indemnified
Person) incurred or paid to procure such recoveries).

8.4.Period for Claims. Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.4, the
period (the "Claims Period") during which claims may be made for Indemnifiable
Damages if and to the extent resulting, directly or indirectly, from:

(a)the matters listed in Section 8.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to any of
the Special Representations), Section 8.2(a)(ii), Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section
8.2(a)(iv) and/or Section 8.2(a)(v) shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on the Escrow Release Date;

(b)the matter listed in Section 8.2(a)(viii) shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at such time as the Stockholders' Agent has fully satisfied its
obligations in its capacity as such;

(c)the matters listed in Section 8.2(a)(i) (solely with respect to any of the
Special Representations), Section 8.2(a)(vi), Section 8.2(a)(vii) and/or
Section 8.2(a)(ix) shall commence at the Closing and terminate at 11:59 p.m.
Pacific time on the date that is 30 days following the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable to the underlying matter for which recovery
of Indemnifiable Damages is being sought pursuant to this Article VIII.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnification claim is properly
asserted in writing pursuant to this Article VIII prior to the expiration date
of the applicable Claims Period (as provided in this Section 8.4), the right
to bring such claim shall survive beyond expiration of the applicable Claims
Period provided for above, but only for the purpose of the resolution of such
claim pursuant to Article VIII, in accordance with Title 10, Section 8106(c)
of the Delaware Code. 8.5.Claims.

(a)From time to time during the Claims Period, Acquirer may deliver to the
Stockholders' Agent one or more certificates signed by any officer of Acquirer
(each, a "Claim Certificate"):

i.stating that an Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved or accrued
(in accordance with GAAP), or in good faith believes that it is reasonably
likely to incur, pay, reserve or accrue (in accordance with GAAP),
Indemnifiable Damages (or that with respect to any Tax matters, that any Tax
Authority is reasonably likely to raise such matter in audit of Acquirer or
its subsidiaries, that could give rise to Indemnifiable Damages);

ii.stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the
maximum amount believed by Acquirer in good faith to be incurred, paid,
reserved, accrued or demanded by a third party); and (iii) specifying in
reasonable detail (based upon the information then possessed by Acquirer) the
individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages included in the amount so
stated and the nature of the claim to which such Indemnifiable Damages are
related.

(b)Such Claim Certificate (i) need only specify such information to the
knowledge of such officer of Acquirer as of the date thereof, (ii) shall not
limit any of the rights or remedies of any Indemnified Person with respect to
the underlying facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such Claim
Certificate and (iii) may be updated and amended from time to time by Acquirer
by delivering any updated or amended Claim Certificate, so long as the
delivery of the original Claim Certificate and any update or amendment thereto
that expands the nature of the claims is made within the applicable Claims
Period and in all cases such update or amendment relates to the underlying
facts and circumstances specifically set forth in such original Claims
Certificate; provided that all claims for Indemnifiable Damages properly set
forth in a Claim Certificate or any update or amendment thereto shall remain
outstanding until such claims have been resolved or satisfied pursuant to this
Article VIII, notwithstanding the expiration of such Claims Period. No delay
in providing such Claim Certificate within the applicable Claims Period shall
affect an Indemnified Person's rights hereunder, unless (and then only to the
extent that) the Stockholders' Agent or the Converting Holders are materially
prejudiced thereby.

8.6.Resolution of Objections to Claims.

(a)If the Stockholders' Agent does not contest, by written notice to Acquirer,
any claim or claims by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within the
30-day period following receipt of such Claim Certificate, then the Escrow
Agent shall, upon Acquirer's direction, distribute to Acquirer an amount of
cash from the Escrow Fund having a total value equal to the amount of any
Indemnifiable Damages corresponding to such claim or claims as set forth in
such Claim Certificate.

(b)If the Stockholders' Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by
Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within the 30-day period set forth in
Section 8.6(a), Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent shall attempt in good
faith for 45 days after Acquirer's receipt of such written objection to
resolve such objection. If Acquirer and the Stockholders' Agent shall so
agree, a joint written instruction setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared, signed by both parties and delivered to the Escrow Agent. Upon receipt of such instruction, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute to Acquirer an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms of such joint written instruction.

(c)If no such agreement can be reached during the 45-day period for good faith
negotiation set forth in Section 8.6(b), but in any event upon the expiration
of such 45-day period, either Acquirer or the Stockholders' Agent may bring
suit in accordance with the terms of Section 9.12 to resolve the matter.

(d)Any portion of the Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent following the
Escrow Release Date shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the Paying Agent for
further distribution to the Acquirer or the Converting Holders (or, in the
case of Company Optionholders who are subject to income or employment Tax
withholding by Acquirer or the Surviving Corporation, through Acquirer's or
the Surviving Corporation's payroll system) in accordance with each such
Converting Holder's Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount, as applied to such
portion of the Escrow Fund, in each case, within five (5) Business Days
following resolution of such claims in accordance with Section 8.1(d).

8.7.Stockholders' Agent.

(a)At the Closing, and by virtue of the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Converting Holders and without any further action of any of
the Converting Holders or the Company, Fortis Advisors LLC shall be
constituted and appointed as the Stockholders' Agent. The Stockholders' Agent
shall be the exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the
Converting Holders to: (i) execute, as the Stockholders' Agent, this Agreement
and any agreement or instrument entered into or delivered in connection with
the Transactions, (ii) give and receive notices, instructions and
communications permitted or required under this Agreement, or any other
agreement, document or instrument entered into or executed in connection
herewith, for and on behalf of any Converting Holder, to or from Acquirer (on
behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person) relating to this Agreement
or any of the Transactions and any other matters contemplated by this
Agreement or by such other agreement, document or instrument (except to the
extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or
communication shall be given or received by each Converting Holder
individually), (iii) review, negotiate and agree to and authorize Acquirer to
reclaim an amount of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims
asserted by Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Indemnified Person,
including by not objecting to such claims) pursuant to this Article VIII, (iv)
object to such claims pursuant to Section 8.6, (v) consent or agree to,
negotiate, enter into, or, if applicable, contest, prosecute or defend,
settlements and compromises of, and comply with Orders of courts with respect
to, such claims, resolve any such claims, take any actions in connection with
the resolution of any dispute relating hereto or to the Transactions by
settlement or otherwise, and take or forego any or all actions permitted or
required of any Converting Holder or necessary in the judgment of the
Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing and all of the
other terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement, (vi) consult with
legal counsel, independent public accountants and other experts selected by
it, solely at the cost and expense of the Converting Holders, (vii) consent or
agree to any amendment to this Agreement or to waive any terms and conditions
of this Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Converting Holders
(other than with respect to the payment of the Closing Payment) in accordance
with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein, and (viii) take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement, in each case without having to seek
or obtain the consent of any Person under any circumstance. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Stockholders' Agent shall have no obligation to act on
behalf of the Converting Holders, except as expressly provided herein, in the
Escrow Agreement and in the Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement, and for
purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Stockholders' Agent in any ancillary
agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure Letter. Acquirer,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (including after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to rely on the appointment
of Fortis Advisors LLC as the Stockholders' Agent and treat such Stockholders'
Agent as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact and exclusive agent of each
Converting Holder and has having the duties, power and authority provided for
in this Section 8.7. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification
granted to the Stockholders' Agent Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Converting Holder and shall be binding on any
successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Converting Holder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in
the Escrow Fund. The Converting Holders shall be bound by all actions taken
and documents executed by the Stockholders' Agent in connection with this
Article VIII, and Acquirer and other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
rely exclusively on any action or decision of the Stockholders' Agent. The
Person serving as the Stockholders' Agent may be removed or replaced from time
to time, or if such Person resigns from its position as the Stockholders'
Agent, then a successor may be appointed, by the holders of a majority in
interest of the aggregate amount of cash then held in the Escrow Fund (or, in
the event that there is no cash then held in the Escrow Fund by the Converting
Holders collectively having an Pro Rata Share greater than 50%) upon not less
than 30 days' prior written notice to Acquirer. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholders'
Agent or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. No bond shall be
required of the Stockholders' Agent.

(b)Certain Converting Holders have entered into an engagement agreement (the
"Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement") with the Stockholders' Agent to
provide direction to the Stockholders' Agent in connection with its services
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Stockholders' Agent
Engagement Agreement (such Converting Holders, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory
Group"). Neither the Stockholders' Agent nor its members, managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory
Group (collectively, the "Stockholders' Agent Group"), shall be liable to any
Converting Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement or under the Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement as the
Stockholders' Agent while acting in good faith (and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good
faith) and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Converting
Holders shall severally but not jointly indemnify and defend the Stockholders'
Agent Group and hold it harmless against any loss, Liability, claim, damage,
fee, cost, judgment, fine, amount paid in settlement or expense incurred
without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders' Agent and arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, under the Escrow
Agreement or under the Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement, including all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal
costs, costs of skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery
from insurers reasonably incurred by the Stockholders' Agent (collectively,
the "Stockholders' Agent Expenses"). If not paid directly to the Stockholders'
Agent by the Converting Holders, such Stockholders' Agent Expenses may be
recovered by the Stockholders' Agent, first, from the Expense Fund, and
second, from the portion of the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the
Converting Holders (and not distributed or distributable to an Indemnified
Person or subject to a pending indemnification claim of an Indemnified Person)
on or after the Escrow Release Date pursuant to the terms hereof, at the time
of distribution, and such recovery will be made from the Converting Holders
according to their respective Pro Rata Shares of such losses, Liabilities or
expenses. The Converting Holders acknowledge that the Stockholders' Agent
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the
Stockholders' Agent shall not be required to take any action unless the
Stockholders' Agent has been provided with funds, security or indemnities
which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the Stockholders' Agent
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the
Stockholders' Agent in performing such actions.

(c)After the Closing, any notice or communication given or received by, and
any decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the
Stockholders' Agent that is within the scope of the Stockholders' Agent's
authority under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholders'
Agent Engagement Agreement shall constitute a notice or communication to or
by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the
Converting Holders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Converting Holder and their successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified
in writing by each such Converting Holder, and all defenses which may be
available to any Converting Holder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action
of the Stockholders' Agent taken in good faith under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Stockholders' Agent Engagement Agreement are waived.
Each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon any such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as
being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of, each and every such Converting Holder. Acquirer,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act
within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution
or instruction of the Stockholders' Agent. The Stockholders' Agent shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature
believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has
proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Converting Holder or
other party.

(d)At or promptly following the Effective Time, the Acquirer will wire to the
Stockholders' Agent $500,000 (the "Expense Fund"), which will be used (i) for
the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders' Agent for,
any Stockholders' Agent Expenses incurred pursuant to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement or (ii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group. The
Stockholders' Agent is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or liability for
any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result of its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders' Agent is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no Tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The
Converting Holders will not receive any interest on the Expense Fund and
assign to the Stockholders' Agent any such interest. Subject to Advisory Group
approval, the Stockholders' Agent may contribute funds to the Expense Fund
from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Converting Holders. In
any event no later than contemporaneously with or as soon as practicable
following the earlier of the Escrow Release Date and the completion of the
Stockholders' Agent's responsibilities, the Stockholders' Agent will deliver
the balance of the Expense Fund (the "Expense Fund Surplus") to the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for further distribution to
the Converting Holders in accordance with each such Converting Holder's Pro
Rata Share, as applied to such portion of the Expense Fund. For Tax purposes,
the Expense Fund will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Converting Holders at the time of Closing. 8.8.Third-Party Claims. In the event an Indemnified Person becomes aware of a
claim by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim") that such Indemnified Person in
good faith believes may result in a claim for Indemnifiable Damages by or on
behalf of an Indemnified Person, Acquirer (on behalf of such Indemnified
Person) shall promptly notify the Stockholders' Agent of such Third-Party
Claim (provided that any delay or failure in so notifying the Stockholders'
Agent of such Third-Party Claim shall not limit or relieve the Converting
Holders of their obligations under this Article VIII, except to the extent, if
at all, that the defense of such Third-Party Claim is materially prejudiced by
reason of such delay or failure), and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide copies of any notice or documentation submitted by the
third party making such Third-Party Claim, if any, as soon as reasonably
practicable after receipt of such documentation or notice. Acquirer shall, in
its sole discretion, conduct and control the defense of such Third-Party
Claim; provided that the Stockholders' Agent, at the expense of the Converting
Holders, shall be entitled to participate in (but not to determine the conduct
of) the defense of such Third-Party Claim and engage separate counsel, and
Acquirer shall keep Stockholders' Agent reasonably informed concerning the
progress of such Third-Party Claim. If permitted by the relevant tribunal, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to receive copies of all pleadings,
notices and material communications with respect to such Third-Party Claim to
the extent that receipt of such documents does not affect any privilege
relating to any Indemnified Person, subject to execution by the Stockholders'
Agent of a customary non-disclosure agreement with Acquirer (and, if required,
such third party) to the extent that such materials contain confidential or
proprietary information. The applicable Indemnified Person shall not be
entitled to be indemnified or held harmless under Section 8.2(a) for such
Third-Party Claim if it shall settle such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders' Agent, unless the Indemnified Person has
sought such consent and such consent has been unreasonably withheld or
delayed, it being agreed that the Stockholders' Agent shall not unreasonably
withhold or delay such consent.

8.9.Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Acquirer, the Stockholders' Agent
and the Converting Holders agree to treat (and cause their respective
Affiliates to treat) any payment received by the Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article VIII as adjustments to the Total Consideration for all Tax
purposes to the extent permitted by Applicable Law.

8.10.Sole and Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, other than with
respect to claims for Fraud (subject to Sections 8.3(a), (b) and (c) and
Section 8.4 of this Agreement), non-monetary specific performance or other
non-monetary equitable relief: (a) this Article VIII shall constitute the sole
and exclusive recourse and remedy of the Indemnified Persons for recovery of
Indemnifiable Damages arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the other Transactions against the Converting Holders, (b) the only
legal action that may be asserted by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person
with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be a contract action
to recover Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to a claim made under this Article
VIII and (c) no legal action based upon predecessor or successor liability,
contribution, tort, strict liability or any statute, regulation or ordinance
may be maintained by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person with respect to
any matter that is the subject of this Article VIII; provided, that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the rights or remedies of Acquirer or any other Indemnified Person
in connection with any breach or misrepresentation by any Company
Securityholder in any Transaction Document to which such Company
Securityholder is a party, but only to the extent that the applicable
Indemnified Person does not otherwise have recourse for the underlying subject
matter of such breach or misrepresentation as an indemnified matter under this
Article VIII. ARTICLE IX.

Company until the expiration of the applicable Claims Period as set forth
herein. If the Merger is consummated, the Specified Tax Representations and
the representations and warranties made by Acquirer herein and in the other

be of no further force or effect as of the Closing, except to the extent such
covenants, agreements and obligations provide that they are to be performed

Article VIII in respect of any claim based upon any breach of a covenant,
agreement or obligation shall be affected by the expiration of such covenant,
agreement or obligation.

and (c) and Section 8.4 of this Agreement).

direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Acquirer without the prior
consent of any other party hereto; provided that notwithstanding any such
assignment, Acquirer and/or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall remain liable for

be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns.

application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably necessary to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.10.Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, including Section 8.10 and Section 7.2, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and

such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy and nothing herein shall be deemed a
waiver by any party hereto of any right to specific performance or injunctive
relief. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 8.3(b), the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,

Delaware.

9.12.Jurisdiction and Venue; Consent to Service of Process. The parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States of America located within

of the provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, hereby waive, and
agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or other Legal
Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or other Legal Proceeding may
not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof
may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties irrevocably and unconditionally
agree that all claims with respect to such action, suit or other Legal
Proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Delaware Court of Chancery or,
to the extent required by Applicable Law, the federal court located within the
State of Delaware. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and
agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action, suit or Proceeding in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

9.14.Rules of Construction. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement, each Schedule
and each Exhibit attached hereto, the application of any Applicable Law or
rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

9.15.Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege. If the Stockholders' Agent so desires,
acting on behalf of the Converting Holders and without the need for any
consent or waiver by the Company, Acquirer (provided Fenwick is not then
actively representing Acquirer (and for this purpose Fenwick's representation
of the Company prior to Closing shall not (by virtue of the Company being a
subsidiary of the Acquirer post-Closing) be deemed to be representing Acquirer
post-Closing)), or Merger Sub, Fenwick and West LLP ("Fenwick") shall be
permitted to represent the Converting Holders (through the Stockholders'
Agent) after the Closing in connection with any dispute relating to this
Agreement and/or any of the Transactions. Acquirer, Merger Sub and the Company
further agree that, as to all communications among Fenwick and the
Stockholders' Agent and the Converting Holders and their respective Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") to the extent relating to
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions (but not communications between the Company
and Fenwick relating to the general business matters of the Company), the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs
solely to the Seller Group and may be controlled only by the Seller Group and
shall not pass to or be claimed, or deemed waived, by Acquirer, Merger Sub or
the Company. This right to the attorney-client privilege shall exist even if
such communications may exist on the Company's computer system or in documents
in the Company's possession. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises between Acquirer and its subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation), and a Person other than a party to this Agreement
after the Closing, Acquirer and its subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation), shall be entitled to access such materials and assert (but not
waive) the attorney-client privilege.
