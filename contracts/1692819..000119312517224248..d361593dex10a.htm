to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of each of the grantors of the Easements to the assignment thereof to Buyer, but as of the date hereof, such consents have not been obtained. Accordingly, with respect to each Easement,
until such consent is obtained, Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive license and privilege to access, use and otherwise enjoy the benefits of the Licensor&#146;s rights under each Easement in furtherance of Licensee&#146;s
ownership, operation, repair, maintenance, replacement and removal of the pipelines for the provision of natural gas to the Facility, all as contemplated by this Agreement and the APA, to the fullest extent such rights may be exercised by any other

the rights and benefits of ownership thereof, in trust for the benefit of Licensee until such time as the applicable consent is obtained. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding Liabilities (as
defined in the APA) for the use of each Easement to the extent Licensee would have been responsible therefor if a consent to assign any such Easement had been obtained and full legal and/or equitable title in and to such Easement was assigned to
Licensee. Further, Licensee shall at all times comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Easements relating to the use thereof (as though it were the grantee thereunder) and neither Party shall take any action to terminate any
Easement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement is not intended to and does not grant or create an easement, servitude or other real property interest, but creates a license only, and Licensee acknowledges that
Licensee does not and shall not claim at any time any real property interest or estate of any kind or extent whatsoever in the Easements by virtue of this Agreement or Licensee&#146;s use or occupancy of the Easements. In connection with the
foregoing, the Parties further acknowledge that in no event shall the relationship between Licensor and Licensee be deemed to be a so-called landlord-tenant relationship and that in no event shall Licensee be entitled to avail itself of any rights
afforded to tenants under the laws of the state in which the Easements are located. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;1.02 <U>Term</U>. The License to

only if the Parties have obtained the consent of the grantor of any Easement to the assignment thereof to the Licensee (or, if sooner, any unassigned Easement has expired by its terms) then this Agreement and the License herein granted shall be
terminated with respect to any such Easement, without further action by any Party, but this Agreement shall in all events remain in full force and effect until Licensor has obtained grantor consent to the assignment of the last such Easement or the
last such unassigned Easement has expired by it terms. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>ARTICLE 2 </B></P>
