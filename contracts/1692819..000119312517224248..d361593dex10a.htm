any lawful arrangement reasonably requested by Buyer to provide that Buyer
shall receive the interest of Seller, in the benefits under any such Permit
or Contract, including sublicensing, subcontracting or performance by Seller
as agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall undertake to pay or
satisfy the corresponding Liabilities for the enjoyment of such benefit to
the extent Buyer would have been responsible therefor hereunder if such
Consent had been obtained prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall pay and
discharge any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs of Seller
in connection with its cooperation with Buyer pursuant to this _Section
2.06_, including any and all payments made by Seller or any of its Affiliates

to reimburse Seller with respect to costs or payments of Seller or its
Affiliates incurred in connection with its cooperation or obtaining any such
Consents under this _Section 2.06_ in excess of $100,000 in the aggregate
unless Buyer shall have provided prior written consent with respect to such
costs or expenses.

SECTION 2.07  _Purchase Price_.

(a) For and in consideration of the Acquired Assets, in addition to the
assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer agrees to pay to Seller

_minus_  (C) the Closing Date Net Indebtedness Amount, and _plus_ (D) the

"); _plus_ (ii) the Earnout Amount after the Closing, as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 2.11_ (the sum of the amounts described in the immediately preceding
clauses (i) and (ii), being referred to herein as the " _Purchase Price_ ").
The Closing Purchase Price and all components thereof shall be calculated in
accordance with the definitions thereof and, to the extent applicable, the
methodology set forth on _Schedule C_.

 

(b) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller

payment of the Estimated Closing Date Payment.

 

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller an amount
equal to the Estimated Closing Date Payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of Seller as delivered pursuant to _Section
2.07(b)_.

7 SECTION 2.10 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(a) After the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other
and provide each other with such access to the books, records and relevant
employees of the other as they may reasonably request in connection with the
matters addressed in this _Section 2.10_; _provided_ , _however_ , that none
of Seller or any of its Affiliates will be required to grant access or make
available its Tax Returns (except for Tax Returns for Property Taxes to the
extent related to the Acquired Assets) for any purpose, including in
connection with any proceeding or other dispute pursuant to this _Section
2.10_. Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a statement (the " _Buyer s Statement_") setting forth its calculation
of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Date
Net Indebtedness Amount and the resulting Closing Purchase Price, together
with reasonable supporting information and calculations.

(b) If Seller objects to any matter set forth on Buyers Statement, then it
shall provide Buyer written notice thereof within thirty (30) days after
receiving the Buyers Statement; _provided_ , that Seller and Buyer shall be
deemed to have agreed upon all items and amounts that are not disputed by
Seller in such written notice. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any
matter set forth on Buyers Statement disputed by Seller in accordance with
this  _Section 2.10(b)_, within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
Closing Date, the Parties shall refer such dispute to a division of KPMG LLP
that does not currently provide services to any Party or, if such division of
KPMG LLP declines to act as provided in this _Section 2.10(b)_, a firm of
independent public accountants, mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (KPMG
LLP or such agreed independent public accountants, as applicable, the "
_Independent Accountants_ "), and the Parties shall cause such firm to make a
final and binding determination as to only those matters in dispute with
respect to this _Section 2.10(b)_ on a timely basis, and, in any event,
within thirty (30) days following its appointment, and shall cause such firm
promptly to notify the Parties in writing of its resolution. In making such
determination, such firm shall (i) limit its review to matters specifically
set forth in Sellers dispute notice delivered pursuant to this _Section
2.10(b)_ as disputed items (other than matters subsequently resolved), (ii)
limit its review to whether the calculation of any such item is in accordance
with this  _Article 2_ , and (iii) not assign to any such disputed item a
value higher than or lower than the values set forth in the Buyers Statement
or such dispute notice. The Parties shall not authorize the Independent
Accountants to modify or amend any term or provision of this Agreement or
modify items previously agreed among the Parties. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall be liable for and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by
the Independent Accountants. If Seller does not object to any matter set
forth on Buyers Statement within the time period and in the manner set forth
in the first sentence of this _Section 2.10(b)_ or if Seller accepts the
Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount, the Closing Date Net Indebtedness
Amount, and the resulting Closing Purchase Price set forth on Buyers
Statement, then such Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Net
Indebtedness Amount and Closing Purchase Price shall become final, binding
and non-appealable upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

(c) If the Closing Purchase Price, as finally determined as provided in
_Section 2.10(b)_ (as agreed between Buyer and Seller or as determined by the
Independent Accountants), (i) exceeds the Estimated Closing Date Payment, then
Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller an amount equal to the amount
of such excess, within five (5) Business Days after such amounts are agreed or
determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Seller, or (ii) is less than the
Estimated Closing Date Payment, then Seller shall pay Buyer (or its designee
as designated in writing by Buyer) an amount equal to the amount of any such
shortfall, within five (5) Business Days after such amounts are agreed
or determined pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Buyer, or (iii) is equal to the
Estimated Closing Date Payment, then no payment shall be made pursuant to
this  _Section 2.10_.

 



8 (d) The Parties agree that the provisions of this _Section 2.10_ and the
dispute resolution process contemplated hereby are intended solely to adjust
for changes in the Closing Purchase Price (as finally determined in _Section
2.10(b)_) as compared to the Estimated Closing Date Payment.

 

SECTION 2.11 _Earnout_.

 

(a) Until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing, no later than the tenth
(10th) day of each calendar month, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in
cash to the account set forth on _Section 2.11(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter (or to such other account as may be specified by Seller from time to
time) (the " _Designated Account_ ") equal to the Monthly Earnout Amount for
the immediately preceding calendar month. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Monthly Earnout Amount is independent of any performance at the Facility and
shall be due and payable regardless of the operating capacity, operating
condition or actual operation of the Facility, or the actual purchase of
natural gas or sale of power by the Facility.

(b) Concurrently with, or prior to, each payment described in _Section
2.11(a)_, Buyer shall deliver to Seller its good faith calculation of the
Monthly Earnout Amount for the immediately preceding month, which such
calculation shall be presented in the form attached as _Exhibit E_ (each, a "
_Monthly Earnout Statement_ "). If Seller objects to any matter set forth in
the Monthly Earnout Statement, then it shall provide Buyer written notice
thereof (an " _Objection Notice_ ") within ten (10) days after receipt
thereof; _provided_ , that Seller and Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed
upon all items and amounts in the Monthly Earnout Statement that are not
disputed by Seller in such written notice. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
agree on any matter set forth in such Objection Notice in accordance with this
_Section 2.11(b)_ within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Objection
Notice, the Parties shall submit such dispute to the Independent Accountants,
shall cause such firm to make a final and binding determination as to only
those matters in dispute on a timely basis, and, in any event, within thirty
(30) days following its appointment, and shall cause such firm promptly to
notify the Parties in writing of its resolution. In making such determination,
such firm shall (i) limit its review to matters specifically set forth in such
Objection Notice as disputed items (other than matters subsequently
resolved), and (ii) not assign to any such disputed item a value higher than
or lower than the values set forth in the Monthly Earnout Statement or such
Objection Notice. The Parties shall not authorize the Independent Accountants
to modify or amend any term or provision of this Agreement or modify items
previously agreed among the Parties. Each of Seller and Buyer shall be liable
for and pay one-half of the fees and other costs charged by the Independent
Accountants in connection with any dispute under this _Section 2.11(b)_. If
(A) Seller does not object to any amounts set forth in a Monthly Earnout
Statement within the time period and in the manner set forth in the
first sentence of this _Section 2.11(b)_, (B) Seller consents in writing to
any of the amounts set forth therein, (C) any amounts are agreed to in writing
by the Parties or (D) the Independent Accountants have made a final
and binding determination of any amounts in accordance with this _Section
2.11(b)_, then such amounts shall become final, binding and non-appealable
upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

 



9 (c) If ERCOT posts any correction to any Day-Ahead Market price, the Parties
shall adjust the Monthly Earnout Amount for any calendar month affected by
such correction. If any such correction results in an increase in any Monthly
Earnout Amount, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such increase (i)
before the Monthly Earnout Amount for such amount is paid, by increasing such
Monthly Earnout Amount when paid or (ii) after the Monthly Earnout Amount for
such amount is paid, by payment in cash by Buyer to Seller to the Designated
Account simultaneously with the next succeeding Monthly Earnout Amount or, if
there are no further Monthly Earnout Amounts due, within ten (10) Business
Days after such correction is posted. If any such correction results in a
decrease in any Monthly Earnout Amount (A) before the Monthly Earnout Amount
for such month is paid, Buyer shall decrease the payment to Seller by an
amount equal to such decrease or (B) after the Monthly Earnout Amount for such
month is paid, (1) to the extent the amount of such decrease is less than or
equal to the next succeeding Monthly Earnout Amount, Buyer shall reduce the
next succeeding Monthly Earnout Amount by an amount equal to such decrease,
(2) to the extent the amount of such decrease is more than the
next succeeding Monthly Earnout Amount, Buyer shall reduce the next
succeeding Monthly Earnout Amount to zero and Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the excess of such decrease over such Monthly Earnout Amount
within ten (10) Business Days after such correction is posted, or (3) if
there are no further Monthly Earnout Amounts due, Seller shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to such decrease within ten (10) Business Days after such
correction is posted.

 

(d) If the Permian Gas Index, the Waha Gas Index or the Odessa Market Price
(each, an " _Index_ ") is temporarily unavailable for any reason, including
the unavailability of the specified service or publication reporting such
Index, then the Parties shall use good faith efforts to find a suitable
replacement index for such temporary period. If any Index is unavailable for
a period of one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days or more or ceases
to be published, then the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to promptly
select a suitable replacement publication or reference price that is generally
accepted in the energy industry. If the Parties are unable to agree on a
replacement publication(s) or reference price within a thirty (30)-day period,
then either Party may refer the matter to the Independent Accountants on terms
that the Independent Accountants shall provide a substitute market
publication(s) or reference price or a combination thereof to be the new Index
for calculation of the Gas Cost or Power Price, as applicable.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall be permitted to transfer its rights and obligations pursuant to
this _Section 2.11_, so long as such transfer complies with applicable Law.

SECTION 2.12 _Tax Treatment_. The Parties agree to report the transactions on
all applicable federal and state Income Tax Returns consistent with the final
Allocation determined pursuant to _Section 5.03(e)_, taking into account
(solely for such purposes) as purchase price on a "closed transaction" method
the risk-adjusted present value of any payments to be made by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to _Section 2.11_. To the extent any payment made by Buyer pursuant
to _Section 2.11_ exceeds or was not otherwise taken into account in
determining such present value, such payment shall be treated as additional
consideration for federal income and other applicable Tax purposes.

existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each
other jurisdiction where the actions required to be performed by it hereunder

jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.02 _Authorization_. Seller has all requisite power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership
action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has been, and on the Closing Date

delivered by Seller shall constitute, (assuming the due execution and delivery
by each other Party) a valid and legally binding obligation of Seller,

SECTION 3.03 _Governmental Consents; Litigation_. No consent, approval,
license, permit, order or authorization (each, a " _Consent_ ") of, or
registration, declaration or filing (each, a " _Filing_ ") with, any
Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by Seller which has not
been obtained or made by Seller in connection with the execution and delivery

by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, other than (a)
the Sellers Required Consents set forth in _Section 3.03_ of the Seller

the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder. No legal action, suit,
arbitration, governmental investigation or other legal, judicial or
administrative proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, against Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to Seller or any
of its Affiliates, in each case, that (a) challenges the validity or
enforceability of Sellers obligations under this Agreement, (b) would be
materially adverse to the ability of Seller to perform its obligations
hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder, or (c)
would be material to the ownership or operation of the Facility.

 



11 SECTION 3.04 _Noncontravention_. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Seller does not, and, subject
to Seller obtaining the Sellers Required Consents, the consummation by Seller

violate or result in any breach of (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) any provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of Seller, (ii)

or (b) result in the imposition or creation of any Lien upon, or with respect
to, any material Acquired Assets; except, in the case of clauses
(a)(ii), (a)(iii) or (b), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, (1)
be material to the ownership or operation of the Facility or (2) reasonably be
expected to result in a material adverse effect on Sellers ability to perform
its obligations hereunder or thereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder.

28 SECTION 5.03 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by Seller
related to the Facility or the Acquired Assets, and Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and shall file all Tax Returns required to be filed by
Buyer related to the Facility or the Acquired Assets.

 

(b) _Tax Contests_. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon
receiving notice from a Taxing Authority after the Closing of any audit,
assessment, litigation, contest or other proceeding relating to Taxes (a "
_Tax Contest_ ") for which Seller would reasonably be expected to be liable
under _Article 8_ or any other provision of this Agreement or under
Law, including Taxes for any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period, and shall
promptly deliver to Seller copies of all correspondence received from a Taxing
Authority in connection with any such Tax Contest. Seller shall have the right
to control the conduct of any Tax Contest relating solely to Taxes for which
Seller (or their direct or indirect equity owners) would be responsible,
including pursuant to _Article 8_ ; _provided_ , that Buyer, at its own
expense, shall be entitled to participate in the conduct of any such Tax
Contest, Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding developments in
such Tax Contest and Seller shall not settle any such Tax Contest that would
be binding on Buyer or that involves any Taxes for which Buyer would be
responsible (whether under _Article 8_ or under applicable Law) without
Buyers prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Buyer shall control the conduct of any other Tax Contest with
respect to the Facility or the Acquired Assets; _provided_ , that if Seller
would reasonably be expected to be responsible for a portion of the Taxes that
would result from such Tax Contest, then Seller, at its own expense, shall
be entitled to participate in the conduct of any such Tax Contest, Buyer
shall keep Seller reasonably informed regarding developments in such Tax
Contest and Buyer shall not settle any such Tax Contest without Sellers prior
written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. To
the extent of any conflict between _Section 8.03_ and this _Section
5.03(b)_, the provisions of this _Section 5.03(b)_ shall control.

 

(c) _Cooperation_. Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.03_,
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns and
any Tax Contest or other proceeding with respect to such Tax Returns or with
respect to Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon a Partys request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, Tax
Contest or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The requesting Party shall reimburse the
cooperating Parties for all reasonable costs and documented, out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by such cooperating Parties.

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise required by Law, Buyer shall file
all Tax Returns required to be filed in respect of Transfer Taxes imposed on
or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay all
Transfer Taxes owing with respect to such returns. The Parties
shall cooperate with each other in connection with the filing of any Tax
Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, including joining in the execution of any
such Tax Return or

 



29  other documentation where necessary. Buyer and Seller shall, upon request of
the other Party, use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any person as may be necessary to
mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax, including by qualifying for
the occasional sale exemption or any other exemption available under
applicable Law. Buyer and Seller intend that the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement will qualify as an "occasional sale" for Texas sales tax
purposes, and will be exempt from such tax pursuant to Texas Tax Code Section
151.304. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a
duly executed Texas Comptroller Form 01-917, Statement of Occasional Sale,
with respect to such transaction. If required by Law to file or pay any
Transfer Tax described in this _Section 5.03(d)_, Seller shall timely pay
such Transfer Tax and provide to Buyer copies of all such filed Tax Returns
relating to Transfer Taxes and reasonable evidence that all such Transfer
Taxes have been timely paid. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the payment of
such Transfer Taxes within ten (10) days of its receipt of such reasonable
evidence.

(e) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Not later than sixty (60) Business Days after
the final determination of Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller an allocation schedule, in the form
set forth in _Section 5.03(e)_ of the Buyer Disclosure Letter, setting
forth Buyers determination of the allocation of the Purchase Price and
assumed (or deemed assumed) obligations to the extent properly taken into
account under the Code among the Assumed Assets that complies with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Allocation_ "). Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any
disputes relating to the Allocation within thirty (30) days. If Seller and
Buyer are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved
promptly by the Independent Accountants, the costs of which shall be borne
equally by Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in a manner consistent with
Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the allocable Purchase
Price or any other amounts constituting consideration for federal Income Tax
purposes pursuant to this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, report consistently with the Allocation in all
Tax Returns, including on Form 8594, and none of the Parties shall take any
position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as
adjusted, in each case, unless required to do so by a final determination as
defined in Section 1313 of the Code or with the written consent of the other
Parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Each of Seller and Buyer agrees to promptly advise the other regarding the
existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to the
Allocation; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.03_ shall require
any of the Parties to litigate before any court, or prevent any of the
Parties from settling in good faith, any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Taxing Authority challenging the Allocation.

 

(f) _Withholding_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Law. If Buyer
determines that any deduction or withholding is required in respect of
a payment pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide notice to Seller at least four (4) Business Days
prior to the date on which such payment is to be made, with a written
explanation substantiating the requirement to withhold. To the extent amounts
are deducted or withheld in accordance with this _Section 5.03(f)_ and
remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the deduction or withholding was made.

 



30 (g) _Parties  Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
(including  _Section 5.03(c)_ and _Section 5.09_), neither Buyer nor its
Affiliates shall have the right at any time to examine the Tax Returns, Tax
work papers, financial statements or books and records of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the non-Income Tax Returns of Seller), and neither
Seller nor its Affiliates shall have the right at any time to examine the Tax
Returns, Tax work papers, financial statements or books and records of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates (other than the non-Income Tax Returns of Buyer), in
each case, including in connection with any Third Party Claim, Tax Contest,
Claim or other dispute (whether among the Parties or involving third parties)
or otherwise.

 

(h) _Apportionment_. For purposes of this Agreement, Liability for any Taxes
of Seller with respect to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned to Seller
for any Pre-Closing Period and to Buyer thereafter. Liability for Property
Taxes with respect to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned to the Pre-
Closing Period on a per diem basis. Liability for Taxes other than
Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable during the Pre-Closing Period if the relevant taxable
period took into account only the Pre-Closing Period on an "interim closing of
the books" method similar to that described in the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 706 of the Code.

SECTION 5.04  _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement, dated as of
December 2, 2016, between Vista Energy Corp. and Koch Energy Holdings, LLC
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated
herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall (i) terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the
Facility and (ii) notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to
the contrary, the obligations of Vista Energy Corp and its Affiliates,
including Buyer, under paragraph 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be
deemed to survive and be in full force and effect (other than in respect of
Continuing Employees) until the date that is two (2) years after the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer acknowledges that any and all other
information provided to it by Seller, any Affiliate of Seller or any
Representative of Seller shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing Date.

 

(b) None of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall make any public announcement or issue any
public communication (including announcements or communications to Plant
Employees and interviews with the media) regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or any matter related to the foregoing,
without first obtaining the prior consent of Seller or Buyer, as applicable
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except if such
announcement or other communication is (i) required by applicable Law or legal
process (including rules of any national securities exchange), in which case
Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall use their best effort to coordinate or
communicate such

 



31  announcement or communication with Seller or Buyer, as applicable, prior to
announcement or issuance (ii) consistent with previous releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties (or
individually, if approved by the other Party) or (iii) made by a Party or its
Affiliates to their respective Affiliates or Representatives, provided that
(A) they are advised of the confidential nature thereof and agree to hold
such information in confidence in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement (and such Party shall be liable for all non-permitted
disclosures by its Affiliates or Representatives) and (B) nothing herein
shall permit a Party, and no Party shall be permitted, to disclose or
disseminate this Agreement to any Person other than their respective
Affiliates and (on a need to know basis) professional advisors and such
Affiliates directors, officers or employees.

SECTION 5.05 _Post-Closing Books and Records_. Buyer shall retain, for at
least seven (7) years after the Closing Date, all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the Facility, the Acquired Assets and Assumed
Liabilities that relate to the period prior to the Closing Date, except for
Tax Returns and supporting documentation relating to the Facility, the
Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities which shall be retained until sixty
(60) days after the date required by applicable Law, and to make the same
available after the Closing Date for inspection and copying by Seller,
at Sellers cost and expense and during regular business hours without
significant disruption to the Facility and upon reasonable request and upon
reasonable advance notice. If Buyer wishes to destroy such books, records and
other documents during such period, Buyer shall give notice of such proposed
destruction to Seller, and upon notice from Seller received within ninety (90)
days of its notice of destruction, at Sellers sole cost and expense, transfer
such books and records to Seller or its designated Affiliate at Sellers
expense.

SECTION 5.06 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
including the provisions of _Section 9.02(a)_, whether or not the Closing
takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring
such costs and expenses, including any fees, expenses or other payments
incurred or owed by a Party to any brokers, financial or legal advisors or
comparable other persons retained or employed by such Party in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 5.07 _Employee Matters; Continuing Employees_.

 

(a) _Continuing Employees_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall deliver, in writing, an offer of employment (on terms
and conditions consistent with this _Section 5.07_) to all then current Plant
Employees to commence such employment immediately after the Closing, other
than any Plant Employees who have been identified as Affected Employees
pursuant to clause (a) of such definition as of such time); _provided_ , that
each such offer shall be subject to the applicable Plant Employees continued
employment with Seller until immediately prior to the Closing and to Buyers
customary pre-employment/post-offer procedures and qualifications; _provided_
_further_ that, with respect to each Plant Employee who is not actively
employed as of immediately prior to the Closing due to a leave of
absence (each, an " _Inactive Plant Employee_ "), any such offer shall (i) be
contingent on (A) such Plant Employee presenting himself or herself to Buyer
for active employment during the six-month period immediately following
the Closing (or such longer period as specified by applicable Law), and
presenting reasonable evidence to Buyer of such readiness for active
employment and

 



32  (B) the circumstances being such that Seller would have been required to re-
employ or continue to employ such Plant Employee in accordance with applicable
Law and its applicable policies, practices and procedures in effect on the
date hereof, if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not
occurred, and (ii) be effective on the date that such Plant Employee presents
himself or herself to Buyer for active employment. Seller will provide Buyer
with a then-current list of Inactive Plant Employees within five (5) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date indicating the last potential date of return.
For all purposes of the remainder of this  _Section 5.07_, with respect to
any Inactive Plant Employee, the date that such Inactive Plant Employee
commences employment with Buyer or the time of such commencement of employment
shall be substituted for the terms "Closing Date" or "Closing", respectively,
wherever such term appears. Each such offer of employment shall be consistent
with the obligations of Buyer set forth in this _Section 5.07_. Such
individuals who accept such offer by the Closing Date are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Continuing Employees_." Effective as of the Closing,
Seller shall terminate the employment of each Plant Employee who satisfies
Buyers pre-employment/post-offer procedures and qualifications (other than
any Plant Employee who has been identified as an Affected Employee pursuant to
clause (a) of such definition).

 

(b) _Seller Benefit Plans_. As of the Closing Date, in no event shall any
Continuing Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under any Seller
Benefit Plan with respect to services rendered or compensation paid on or
after the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, Seller and its
Affiliates shall retain sponsorship of all the Seller Benefit Plans and shall
retain and hold Buyer harmless and indemnify Buyer with respect to all
commitments, Liabilities and obligations thereunder, whether arising before,
on or after the Closing, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
have any responsibility for any such Seller Benefit Plans or commitments,
Liabilities or obligations. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall
cause the account balances of the Continuing Employees in each Seller Benefit
Plan that is a 401(k) plan and the benefits of the Continuing Employees in
each Seller Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or a
nonqualified retirement plan to be fully vested.

 

(c) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits_. For a one (1)-year period
following the Closing, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
compensation (including salary, cash bonus, commissions and other incentives)
and benefits to each Continuing Employee that are substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer during such period; _provided_ that the annual
base pay provided to each Continuing Employee during such one (1)-year period
shall be no less than the annual base pay provided by Seller to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall have any responsibility for any bonuses or incentive
payments payable under the Seller Benefit Plans or payable with respect to any
period prior to the Closing.

 

(d) _Severance_. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this _Section
5.07_, for a one (1)-year period following the Closing, for any termination
of employment by Buyer other than for cause (as determined in Buyers
reasonable discretion), Buyer shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that include at least two
weeks of base pay for every year of service with Seller (or any Affiliate
thereof) and any respective predecessor, subject to a maximum of fifty-two
(52) weeks of base pay per Continuing Employee.

 



33 (e) _Benefit Continuation for Continuing Employees_. Buyer shall waive or
cause to be waived all limitations as to preexisting conditions or waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Continuing Employee under any employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof in which Continuing Employees
participate (or are eligible to participate) that are "welfare benefit plans"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) to the same extent that such conditions
and waiting periods were satisfied or waived under the comparable Seller
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, Buyer shall
provide or cause to be provided each Continuing Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid during the plan year commencing immediately
prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable copayments, deductibles
or other out-of-pocket requirements under any such welfare benefit plans for
such plan year, subject to the provision by Seller or Sellers
insurance carrier to Buyer of valid evidence of such amounts in the format
requested by Buyer.

(f) _Service Credit for Continuing Employees_. Buyer shall provide, or cause
to be provided, to each Continuing Employee credit for all service prior to
the Closing Date, to the same extent as such service was credited under the
comparable Seller Benefit Plan, for all purposes under Buyers severance and
paid time off plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that it results in the duplication of benefits. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Continuing Employees shall not receive credit
for service prior to the Closing Date for purposes of any of Buyers pension
or retiree welfare plans.

(g) _Responsibility for Welfare Plan Claims_. With respect to each Continuing
Employee (including any beneficiary or the dependent thereof), Seller shall
retain all Liabilities and obligations for any medical, dental, health,
accident or disability claim to the extent that such Liability or obligation
relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported or paid) prior to the
Closing Date and Buyer and its Affiliates shall be liable for any such claim
incurred on or following the Closing Date. For purposes of this  _Section
5.07(g)_, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred when (i) with respect to
medical, dental and health related benefits, the medical, dental or health
related services giving rise to such claim are performed, (ii) with respect
to disability and workmens compensation benefits, the injury, sickness or
other event giving rise to the claim for such benefits occurs, and (iii) with
respect to accident or life insurance, the accident or death occurs.

 

(h) _Workforce Matters_. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid at the Closing to
Seller an amount equal to the aggregate severance costs for (i) any Affected
Employee under clause (a) of the definition thereof and (ii) any other Plant
Employee to whom Buyer and its Affiliates fail to offer employment, including
as a result of such employees failure to satisfy Buyers customary pre-
employment qualifications and procedures, in each case whose employment is
terminated by Seller as of the Closing; provided that, in the case of clauses
(i) and (ii), the amount of severance costs payable by Buyer per employee
shall be equal to two weeks base pay for each year of such employees
service, subject to a maximum of 52 weeks base pay per employee. For the
avoidance of doubt, no severance payments will be made to (A) any
Plant Employee who rejects an offer of employment made by Buyer in accordance
with this _Section 5.07_ or (B) any Inactive Plant Employee who does not
receive an offer of employment because any of the contingencies for such offer
described in _Section 5.07(a)(i)_ are not satisfied.

 



34 (i) _COBRA Liabilities_. Seller shall be responsible for providing notices and
coverage under COBRA to any Plant Employee (and his or her qualified
beneficiaries) as to whom a "qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4980B of
the Code) has occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including qualifying
events that occur in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). Buyer shall be responsible for providing notices and coverage
under COBRA to any Continuing Employee (and his or her qualified
beneficiaries) whose "qualifying event" occurs after the Closing Date.

(j) _WARN Act_. Buyer shall be responsible and assume all liability for all
notices or payments due to any Affected Employees under the WARN Act, or to
any Plant Employee who becomes entitled to receive notice as required under
the WARN Act on account of the aggregation of "employment losses" (as defined
in the WARN Act) that occur prior to the Closing with "employment losses"
that occur following the Closing, and all notices, payments, fines or
assessments due to any Governmental Entity, pursuant to any applicable Law
with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of employees by Buyer or
its Affiliates after the Closing Date, including the WARN Act. Seller shall be
responsible for and shall indemnify Buyer with respect to all such notices,
payments, fines or assessments due to any Plant Employees other than Affected
Employees under the WARN Act or any such other applicable Law that are
triggered solely by the actions of Seller prior to the Closing. As of the
Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer a list of any "employment losses"
experienced by any Plant Employees during the ninety (90)-day period prior to
the Closing. Such list shall include, with respect to each such Plant
Employee, the date of the employment loss and the applicable site of
employment.

 

(k) _Vacation_. Seller shall pay to each Continuing Employee all amounts in
respect of vacation days and other paid time off accrued but not taken by
such Continuing Employee on or prior to the Closing. Buyer shall have no
obligation to honor such accrued vacation days or paid time off after the
Closing. Following the Closing, the Continuing Employees eligibility for
vacation and other paid time off shall be determined under Buyers vacation
and paid time off policies.

(l) _Employment Tax Reporting Responsibility_. Seller and Buyer hereby agree
to follow the standard procedure for employment tax reporting as provided in
Section 4 of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, I.R.B. 2004-35. Accordingly, Seller shall
have employment tax reporting responsibilities for the wages and other
compensation it pays to Plant Employees and Buyer shall have employment tax
reporting responsibilities for the wages and other compensation it pays to
Plant Employees.

 

(m) _Third-Party Rights_. The provisions of this _Section 5.07_ are for the
sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed
or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Plant Employee), other than
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of
Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this
Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

 



35 SECTION 5.08 _Further Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts (except where a different efforts
standard is specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case such
different standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in an expeditious manner and to cause any of the conditions to such Partys
obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in _Article 6_
to be satisfied. 

(b) The Parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to

date of this Agreement) making all notices or filings necessary to obtain the
Consents listed in _Sections 6.02(e)_ and _6.02(f)_ of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter, (ii)(A) preparing and filing as soon as practicable (and
in any event, for the HSR Act, within five (5) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement) all other such Filings or Consents with or from any
Governmental Entity or other Person that are required to be filed or obtained
prior to Closing in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
(B) assuring that all such Filings are in material compliance with the
requirements of applicable regulatory laws, and (C) subject to applicable
legal limitations making available to the other Party such information as the
other Party may reasonably request in order to complete the Filings or to
respond to information requests by any relevant Governmental Entity or
members of its staff, (iii) subject to applicable legal limitations and the
instructions of any Governmental Entity or members of its staff, keeping each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated thereby, including but not limited to promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications, filings
or correspondence between the Parties, or any of their respective
subsidiaries, and any Person or Governmental Entity (or members of their
respective staffs) with respect to the transactions, (iv) responding to and
complying with, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any request for
information or documentary material regarding the transactions from any
relevant Governmental Entity or members of its staff (including responding to
any "second request" for additional information or documentary material under
the HSR Act as promptly as reasonably practicable), (v) using their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the prompt expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period and clearance or approval by any
relevant Governmental Entity, including defense against, and the resolution
of, any objections or challenges, in court or otherwise, by any relevant
Governmental Entity preventing consummation of the transactions, (vi) using
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions necessary
to cause all conditions set forth in _Article 6_ to be satisfied as soon as
practicable, (vii) executing and delivering any additional instruments
necessary to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and (viii) using
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby. Prior to 

 



36  communicating any information to any Person or Governmental Entity (or
members of their respective staffs) in oral or written form, each party shall
permit counsel for the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and
provide comments thereon, and consider in good faith the views of the other
party in connection with, any proposed communication to any Person or
Governmental Entity (or members of their respective staffs) to the extent
permitted by Law. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees not to participate in any
meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Person or
Governmental Entity (or members of their respective staffs) in connection with
the proposed transaction unless it consults with the other party in advance
and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate
and advisable under the circumstances.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall
contest, at its cost and expense, any challenge to this Agreement by any
Governmental Entity, including contesting through a litigation proceeding
initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, or
the PUCT to enjoin the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer shall
control all aspects of said litigation for the Parties, provided that, except
as set forth in _Section 5.08(d)_ with respect to any Subsequent Transaction
and Subsequent Transaction Plan, Buyer shall afford Seller with reasonable
advance written notice of any such contest or litigation, an opportunity to
participate in the development and formulation of the legal strategy of such
contest or litigation, an opportunity to participate in all associated
proceedings, and Buyer shall consider in good faith Sellers views and
opinions in all material respects related to such matters (provided that,
Buyer shall retain full discretion and authority with respect to the aspects
of any such litigation).

 

(d) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.08(d)_, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall have no obligation hereunder to commit to any divestitures,
licenses, hold separate or similar arrangements, conduct of business
restrictions or other actions or non-actions with respect to their respective
assets and businesses (or with respect to the Facility, Acquired Assets
or Assumed Liabilities) as a condition to obtaining the Consents required to
be obtained from any Governmental Entity. If, prior to the Closing, Buyer or
any of its Affiliates enters into any agreement or similar arrangement in
which Buyer and/or any Affiliate would acquire, directly or indirectly, one
or more other power generation facilities in ERCOT (a " _Subsequent
Transaction_ ") such that Buyer and its Affiliates would own and control
installed generating capacity in ERCOT in an amount that exceeds the
Generating Capacity Threshold upon the closing of such Subsequent Transaction
(when taking into consideration the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement), then within twenty (20) Business Days from the entry into a
definitive agreement related to such Subsequent Transaction, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall propose, and promptly seek approval of, a plan, commitment or
arrangement that would reduce Buyers and its Affiliates installed
generating capacity in ERCOT below the Generating Capacity Threshold (a "
_Subsequent Transaction Plan_ "), that would permit (i) Buyer and its
Affiliates to close on such Subsequent Transaction and (ii) the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in the manner contemplated
by this Agreement, without any modification to the terms or conditions of this
Agreement. Upon the approval or acceptance of such Subsequent Transaction Plan
by the PUCT, Buyer and its Affiliates shall implement and comply with such
plan as promptly as reasonably practicable. Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably
informed of the status of the preparation, submission and implementation of
any Subsequent Transaction Plan. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be deemed to
have satisfied the covenants and agreements contained in this _Section
5.08(d)_ for all purposes (including for purposes of _Article 8_ ) upon the
Closing.

 



37 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller or any of its Affiliates to
incur any expense or Liability (other than costs and expenses of Sellers
attorneys and other advisors), enter into any new commitment or agreement or
agree to any modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain the
Required Consents or any approvals or waivers of parties to Contracts with
Seller and, subject to _Section 2.06_ (with respect to seeking any Consent
other than a Required Consent or any other Consent, approval or waiver from a
Governmental Entity), all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (other than costs
and expenses of Sellers attorneys and other advisors) associated with
obtaining any such Required Consents or approvals or waivers, including any
Consent or waiver fees, if any, that may be required or payable, shall be
paid solely by Buyer.

(f) Each Party shall (i) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
made to, or received by such Party from, any Governmental Entity or members
of its staff regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for
additional information and documentary material received from any
Governmental Entity or members of its staff, (iii) except as required by
applicable Law, and except with written consent of the other Party, not enter
into any agreement with any Governmental Entity agreeing not to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) promptly inform the
other Party of any communication made to, or received by such Party from, any
Governmental Entity or members of its staff regarding any
Environmental, Health and Safety Law.

(g) Subject to the compliance of the Parties with this _Section 5.08_,
neither Party shall have any liability whatsoever to the other Party arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents or make any Filings,
or because of the termination of, or default under, any Contract, in each case
to the extent such Consents, Filings or Contracts are listed on _Section
3.03_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter or _Section 4.03_ of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter.

 

(h) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the request of
either Seller or Buyer, each of the Parties will do, execute, acknowledge and
deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers,
conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or
appropriate to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(i) The Parties will cooperate and negotiate in good faith to agree to the
terms of a confirmation to the existing ISDA Master Agreement between KES and
Luminant Energy Company LLC, dated July 21, 2015 (the " _Gas Supply Agreement_
") within thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the failure of the Parties to enter into the Gas Supply
Agreement shall not affect the Parties conditions set forth in _Sections
6.02(a)_ or _6.03(a)_.

 



38 SECTION 5.09 _Post-Closing Cooperation_. After Closing, upon prior reasonable
written request, each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other in furnishing records, information, oral or written
testimony, oral or written attestations and certifications, and other
assistance in connection with transition matters, any required post-Closing
filings with Governmental Entities, and any inquiries or proceedings involving
Seller, but excluding any proceedings arising from disputes among the Parties.
Each such requesting Party shall reimburse such cooperating Party for any
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by such cooperating Party
as a result of any such requested cooperation.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Risk of Loss_. Buyer shall solely bear the risk of loss with
respect to the Acquired Assets for any event or occurrence after the Closing.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.10_, during the Interim
Period all risk of loss or damage to the property or assets of Seller shall,
as between Buyer and Seller, be borne by Seller. If during the Interim Period
the property or assets of Seller are damaged by fire, equipment breakage or
other casualty (each such event, an " _Event of Loss_ "), or are taken by a
Governmental Entity by exercise of the power of eminent domain (each, a "
_Taking_ "), then the following provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall
apply:

(a) Following the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss, if the
aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the property or assets of Seller
subject to such Event of Loss to a condition reasonably comparable to their
prior condition, plus the amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to
accrue after Closing as a result of such Event of Loss, such amount pursuant
to this clause (i) to be determined by an independent third party appraiser
mutually selected by the Parties (collectively, " _Restoration Costs_ ") and
(ii) any one or more Takings, if the value of the property subject to such
Taking plus the amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after
Closing as a direct result of such Taking, less any condemnation award
received by Buyer (provided, that any such condemnation award is made
available to Buyer), such amount pursuant to this clause (ii) to be determined
by an independent third party appraiser mutually selected by the
Parties (collectively, the " _Condemnation Value_ "), is, in the aggregate,
less than or equal to $3,500,000, there shall be no effect on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Subject to the termination right of Buyer and Seller set forth in clause
(d) below, upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Loss or Takings
involving aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value in excess of
$3,500,000 (a " _Major Loss_ "), Seller shall have, in the case of a Major
Loss relating solely to one or more Events of Loss, the option, exercised by
notice to Buyer, to restore, repair or replace the damaged assets or
properties prior to Closing to a condition reasonably comparable to their
prior condition. If Seller elects to so restore, repair or replace the assets
or properties relating to a Major Loss, which election shall be made by
notice to Buyer prior to the Closing Date and as soon as practicable following
the occurrence of the Major Loss, Seller will complete or cause to be
completed the repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged assets or
property prior to the Closing and the Closing Date shall be postponed for the
amount of time reasonably necessary to complete the restoration, repair or
replacement of such property or assets as reasonably agreed among Buyer and
Seller to allow for the restoration, repair or replacement of such assets or
properties, _provided_ , that in no event shall such postponement extend
beyond the Outside Date). If Seller elects not to cause the restoration,
repair or replacement of the property or assets affected by a Major Loss, or
such Major Loss is the result in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is
otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, the provisions
of  _Section 5.10(c)_ will apply.

 



39 (c) Subject to the termination right of Buyer and Seller set forth in clause
(d) below, in the event that Seller elects not to cause the restoration,
repair or replacement of a Major Loss, or in the event that Seller, having
elected to cause repair, replacement or restoration of the Major Loss, fails
to cause its completion within the period of time agreed upon by the Parties
pursuant to _Section 5.10(b)_ (subject to extension for up to ninety (90)
days for causes beyond Sellers control), or in the event that a Major Loss is
the result in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is otherwise not
capable of being restored, repaired or replaced, then the Parties shall,
within thirty (30) days following Sellers election not to cause the
restoration, repair or replacement, failure to complete, or the occurrence of
such Major Loss, as the case may be, adjust the Base Purchase Price by the
aggregate Restoration Cost and Condemnation Value related thereto, as
mitigated by any repair, replacement or restoration work actually completed
by Seller on the assets or properties being sold to Buyer, and proceed to
Closing. To assist Buyer in its evaluation of any and all Events of Loss,
Seller shall provide Buyer such access to the properties and assets and such
information as Buyer may reasonably request in connection therewith.

(d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value
with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an amount in
excess of $35,000,000, then either Buyer or Seller shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.11 _No Solicitation; Alternative Transactions_. From the date hereof
until the earlier of (a) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article 9_ and (b) the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and Sellers
Affiliates, Representatives and agents will not, directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or negotiations
with, provide any information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any Person or group (other
than any Affiliate, associate or designee of Buyer) concerning any proposal
for the sale, merger, combination, joint venture, recapitalization or other
transaction involving all or any part of the equity, business or properties of
Seller (each, a " _Competing Transaction_ "), other than providing information
to Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives in connection
with the transaction contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof
or (ii) enter into any Contract or agreement in principle (whether or not
legally binding) relating to any Competing Transaction. Seller shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions, negotiations or other communications between or among Seller and
its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, partners,
representatives, Affiliates or other intermediaries and any third parties
(other than Buyer and its representatives) conducted heretofore with respect
to any Competing Transaction.

 

SECTION 5.12 _Schedule Update_. From time to time prior to the Closing, Seller
may, at its option, supplement or amend and deliver updates to the Seller
Disclosure Letter (each a " _Letter Update_"), that are necessary to complete
or correct any information in such Seller Disclosure Letter, or in any
representation or warranty of Seller, that has been rendered inaccurate or
incomplete due to any change, event, effect or occurrence since the date of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Schedule Update shall
qualify any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller
for any purpose hereunder, affect any remedy available to any Indemnified
Buyer Entity hereunder (including indemnification pursuant to _Article 8_ or
the right to specific performance hereunder) or affect the determination of
whether the conditions to Closing have been satisfied.

 



40 SECTION 5.13 _Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) For a period from the date hereof to the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, and Koch Ag and its Subsidiaries shall not,
and their respective directors, officers and employees shall not cause,
solicit, induce or encourage any Continuing Employees to leave such employment
or hire, employ or otherwise engage any such individual (other than by means
of general advertising of employment).

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing, Koch Ag and its
Subsidiaries and Seller shall not, and their respective directors, officers
and employees shall not directly or indirectly, disclose or divulge any
information of the Facility, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities;
_provided_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to information
(i) which becomes available to Koch Ag, any of its Subsidiaries, Seller or any
of their respective directors, officers and employees from a third-party
source or (ii) which is in the public domain or enters into the public domain
without breach of this Agreement by Koch Ag, any of its Subsidiaries, Seller
or any of their respective directors, officers and employees. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (1) the obligations of confidentiality under this _Section
5.13(b)_ shall not (A) limit Koch Ags and its Subsidiaries use or disclosure
of residuals resulting from the ownership or operation of the Facility or the
Acquired Assets and (B) restrict the trading activities of Koch Ag or its
Subsidiaries and (2) in the event Koch Ag and its Subsidiaries, Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates or any of such persons directors, officers and
employees is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories,
requests for information or documents in a legal proceeding, subpoena or other
similar process) to disclose information of the Facility, the Acquired Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities; (i) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing
unless prohibited by Law or legal process, which notification shall include
the nature of such legal requirement and the extent of the required
disclosure, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Buyer, at Buyers expense, to preserve, to the extent possible, the
confidentiality of such information and (ii) in the absence of a protective
order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by Buyer, Seller is legally
required to disclose such information, Seller may, without liability
hereunder, disclose to such Person or tribunal only that portion of the
information which Seller has determined in good faith is legally required to
be disclosed, provided that Seller uses its reasonable best efforts to
preserve the confidentiality of the information. The term "residuals" means
non-specific information in non-tangible form, which is retained in the
unaided memory of a person who has had access to the Sellers information.

(c) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 5.13_ relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 5.13_ will cause irreparable
injury to Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this _Section 5.13_ will be inadequate. Therefore,
Buyer will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of
this _Section 5.13_ without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this _Section
5.13_ are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. If Buyer were to seek damages
for any breach of this _Section 5.13_, the portion of the Purchase Price
which is allocated by the Parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be
considered a measure of or limit on such damages.

 



41 (d) The Parties agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final
non-appealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a specified
business limitation or any other relevant feature of this _Section 5.13_ is
unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser time period,
business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such
court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be
enforced against the applicable party.

 

SECTION 5.14 _Release_. Upon and subject to the Closing, the Parties undertake
as follows:

 

(a) _Seller Release_. Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
successors, assigns, heirs, executors, legatees,
administrators, beneficiaries, representatives and agents (the " _Seller
Releasing Parties_ "), fully, finally and irrevocably releases, acquits and
forever discharges Buyer, its Affiliates, officers, directors, predecessors,
successors and assigns, and the beneficiaries, heirs, executors, personal or
legal representatives, insurers and attorneys of any of them (collectively,
the " _Buyer Released Parties_ "), from any and all commitments, Claims,
promises, agreements, debts, damages, Liabilities, obligations, costs and
expenses of every kind and nature whatsoever, whether arising from any
Contract or in tort, known or unknown, past, present or future, at law or in
equity, contingent or otherwise (collectively, a " _Potential Claim_ "), that
such Seller Releasing Parties, or any of them, had, has or may have had at any
time in the past until and including the Closing or that may arise in the
future, against the Buyer Released Parties, or any of them, for or by reason
of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever occurring at any time at or prior to
the Closing with respect to the ownership or operation of the Facility, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities (collectively, the " _Buyer
Released Matters_ "), except that the Buyer Released Matters do not include,
and nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall affect or be construed as a waiver
or release by Seller Releasing Parties of, any Potential Claim by any of the
Seller Releasing Parties arising from or relating to (i) the payment of the
Purchase Price and any payments resulting from the Purchase Price adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2.10_ on and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, and any Indemnifiable Losses payable by Buyer pursuant to _Article 8_
, (ii) Sellers right to defend (including through a counterclaim) any claim
of indemnification asserted against Seller or (iii) the performance by Buyer
of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) _No Transfer of Potential Claims_. Seller represents and warrants to
Buyer and the other Buyer Released Parties that it has not conveyed, pledged,
transferred, hypothecated, or in any manner encumbered or assigned, to any
other Person any of the Potential Claims for any Buyer Released Matter.

 

(c) _Release Not Considered an Admission_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that neither this Agreement nor the furnishing of the consideration for the
release given under this _Section 5.14_ and _Section 7.02(b)_ will be deemed
or construed at any time to be an admission by any Party or any Seller
Released Party or any Buyer Released Party of any improper or unlawful
conduct.

 



42 (d) _Waiver of Unknown Claims_. Seller expressly acknowledges that this 
_Section 5.14_ is intended to include in its effect all claims with respect
to the Buyer Released Matters that it does not know or suspect to exist in its
favor as of the date hereof, and that this Agreement contemplates the
extinguishment of any such claim or claims. With respect to any and all
Potential Claims for any Buyer Released Matter, Seller expressly waives and
relinquishes, and the other Seller Releasing Parties shall be deemed to have
expressly waived and relinquished, any and all provisions, rights and
benefits conferred by any Law of any jurisdiction or principle of common law
that provides that a general release does not extend to claims that are
unknown or unsuspected to the releasor at the time the releaser executes the
release. Seller acknowledges that the inclusion of such unknown Potential
Claims herein was separately bargained for and was a key element of this
_Section 5.14_. Seller acknowledges, and the other Seller Releasing
Parties shall be deemed to have acknowledged, that they may hereafter
discover facts which are different from or in addition to those that they may
now know or believe to be true with respect to any and all Potential Claims
herein released and agree that all such unknown Potential Claims are
nonetheless released and that this _Section 5.14_ shall be and remain
effective in all respects even if such different or additional facts are
subsequently discovered.

 

(e) _Covenant Not to Sue_. Seller hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain
from, and to cause all Seller Releasing Parties controlled by it to refrain
from, asserting any Potential Claim, or commencing, instituting or causing to
be commenced, any action of any kind against any of the Buyer Released
Parties, in any forum whatsoever (including any administrative agency), that
arises out of, relates in any way to, or is based upon, any of the Buyer
Released Matters.

(f) _Sufficiency of Consideration_. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
Purchase Price paid pursuant hereto in respect of the Acquired Assets and the
covenants of Buyer has provided good and sufficient consideration for every
promise, duty, release, obligation, agreement and right contained herein,
including this _Section 5.14_.

(g) _Basis of Defense; Attorneys  Fees_. This  _Section 5.14_ may be
pleaded by the Buyer Released Parties as a full and complete defense and may
be used as the basis for an injunction against any action at law or equity
instituted or maintained against them in violation of this  _Section 5.14_.
In the event any Potential Claim is brought or maintained by Seller or any
Seller Releasing Parties against the Buyer Released Parties in violation of
this _Section 5.14_, Seller shall be responsible for all costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the Buyer Released Parties
in defending same.

SECTION 5.15  _Transition Services_.

(a) Seller shall cause its Affiliates to provide to Buyer for the sixty (60)
day period immediately following the Closing Date all or the portion of the
transition services listed on _Section 5.15_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter
that are reasonably requested in writing (providing reasonable detail) from
Buyer to Seller as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement (but in any event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing) except that Seller shall have no obligation to cause its Affiliates
to provide any such services that were not requested in writing from Buyer to
Seller at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing (the services
referred to in this sentence being the " _Transition Services_ "). Seller
shall cause its Affiliates to perform any Transition Services provided
hereunder in substantially the same

 



43  quality and manner as the same or comparable services were provided by an
Affiliate of Seller to Seller during the three (3)-month period preceding the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, except for the provisions of _Section
5.16(b)(i)_, which shall govern over anything in this sentence, (A) none of
Seller or its Affiliates shall have any liability to Buyer or its Affiliates
for any acts or omissions of Seller or its Affiliates in connection with this
_Section 5.15_ and the Transition Services; (B) Buyer shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any and all
Indemnifiable Losses relating to the Transition Services except to the extent
such Indemnifiable Losses were caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates; and (C) the exclusive remedy
of Buyer and its Affiliates against Seller or any of its Affiliates for
breach of this _Section 5.15_ or otherwise relating to the Transition
Services shall be limited to termination (effective upon thirty (30) days
prior written notice) of the affected Transition Service and, in the case of
Sellers or its Affiliates gross negligence or willful misconduct, monetary
damages (but in no event exceeding the amount paid to Seller for such
Transition Services under  _Section 5.15(b)_).

(b) Buyer, upon not less than fifteen (15) days written notice to Seller, at
any time and from time to time may, as of the date set forth in such notice
(which may not precede the end of such fifteen (15)-day period without
Sellers approval), reduce or terminate its right to receive (and Sellers
associated obligations to provide or cause the provision of) any or all of
the applicable Transition Services. Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the
reasonable costs or expenses actually incurred by or on behalf of Seller or
its Affiliates attributable to the provision of Transition Services,
including the costs of all compensation and benefits and employment Taxes on
such compensation and benefits, any reasonable allocations of overhead
expenses of Seller and its Affiliates and any retention payments required to
retain employees who provide Transition Services (such costs and expenses,
the " _Direct Costs_ "). No later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day after
the end of each calendar month during which Seller or its Affiliates
provided Transition Services, beginning with the calendar month immediately
following the Closing, Seller shall submit an invoice to Buyer for the Direct
Costs incurred during such calendar month. If the Closing occurs on a day
other than the last day of a month, the invoice for the first (1st) month
shall be only for those Transition Services provided from such date until the
end of the month in which the Closing took place. Buyer shall pay or cause to
be paid each such invoice it receives within fifteen (15) days after its
receipt thereof.

SECTION 5.16 _Post-Closing Collections and Payments_. From and after the
Closing, (a) Buyer will (i) remit to Seller any payment that Buyer or any of
Buyers Affiliates receives or collects in respect of any Excluded Asset and
(ii) reimburse Seller for any payment Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates
makes to a third-party in payment of an Assumed Liability and (b) Seller will
(i) remit to Buyer any payment or settlement that Seller or any of Sellers
Affiliates receives or collects on any note or receivable that constitutes,
or any sale of energy or capacity in the wholesale electric market from, an
Acquired Asset including any payment or settlement made for Transition
Services under _Section 5.15_ and (ii) reimburse Buyer for any payment Buyer
or any of Buyers Affiliates makes to a third-party in payment of a Retained
Liability. Each Party will provide the other Party with reasonable detail
regarding any such payments. Any remittance or reimbursement required to be
made by a Party pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ will be (x) made net of any
outstanding remittance or reimbursement owed to such Party pursuant to this
_Section 5.16_ and (y) made promptly, and in any event not later than
the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month immediately following the
calendar month in which the payment giving rise to such remittance or
reimbursement, as applicable, was received or made.

 



44 SECTION 5.17 _Seller Guarantees_. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer will
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the respective
beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
effective as of the Closing, valid and binding written releases of Seller and
any of its Affiliates, as applicable, from any Liability, whether arising
before, on or after the Closing Date, under the Seller Guarantees set forth on
Section 5.17 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, by providing substitute
guarantees by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer approved by the applicable
counterparty and containing terms that are as favorable to the counterparty as
the terms of the applicable Seller Guarantee and by furnishing letters of
credit, instituting escrow arrangements, posting surety or performance bonds
or making other arrangements as the counterparty may reasonably request;
provided, however, if Buyer is unable to obtain the valid and binding written
release of Seller under any such Seller Guarantees, then (i) Buyer
shall indemnify Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, with respect to any
claim for damages resulting from or attributable to such unreleased Seller
Guarantee and to provide to Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable, security
reasonably acceptable to Seller to provide immediate support in respect of
such indemnity obligation and (ii) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, from and after the Closing, to obtain from the respective
beneficiary, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and
effective as of the Closing, valid and binding written releases of Seller and
any of its Affiliates under any such Seller Guarantee. Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide to any such beneficiary
all financial and other information regarding Buyer or its Affiliates as may
be reasonably requested by such beneficiary to facilitate such substitute
guarantees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that until the date that is ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Seller and its Affiliates shall not terminate, obtain release of
or otherwise limit its Liability under any and all outstanding Seller
Guarantees.

 

SECTION 5.18 _Post-Closing Use of Name; MBM Materials_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) it has no right, title or interest
in or to (A) the MBM Materials, or (B) the Seller Marks, including the Seller
Marks described on _Section 5.18(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, as well
as any item generally described in the definition of "Seller Marks" that is
confusingly similar to any Seller Mark, (ii) it shall have no right to use
the MBM Materials or, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
Seller Marks after the Closing, and (iii) it shall otherwise cease to hold
itself and the Facility out as having any affiliation with Seller or any of
its Affiliates. In furtherance thereof, as promptly as practicable but in no
event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (A)
remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Seller Marks from all
Acquired Assets, including any vehicles, business cards, schedules,
stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials,
manuals, forms, computer software, technical guidelines, standards and
procedures and other materials included in the Acquired Assets, and (B)
remove the name and contact information of the Seller or any of its Affiliates
with respect to any pipeline markers on or adjacent to the Real Property. For
the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be deemed to have
violated this _Section 5.18(a)_ or to have infringed the rights of Seller or
its Affiliates by reason of the use of the Seller Marks in a non-trademark
manner for purposes of conveying to customers, suppliers or the general
public of the change in ownership of the Acquired Assets, or the historical
origins of the Facility.

 



45 (b) The covenants and undertakings contained in this _Section 5.18_ relate to
matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the terms of this _Section 5.18_ will cause irreparable
injury to Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or
determine and which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy
at law for any breach of this _Section 5.18_ will be inadequate. Therefore,
Buyer will be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or other equitable
relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any breach of
this _Section 5.18_ without the necessity of proving actual damages or
posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this _Section
5.18_ are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies which
Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. If Buyer were to seek damages
for any breach of this _Section 5.18_, the portion of the Purchase Price
which is allocated by the Parties to the foregoing covenant shall not be
considered a measure of or limit on such damages.

SECTION 5.19 _Additional Documentation_. During the Interim Period, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such assistance (and
to cause its Affiliates and the respective personnel and advisors of each of
the foregoing to provide such assistance) reasonably requested by Buyer,
including by (a) providing reasonably requested information to Buyer, and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives for use in preparing
financial statements (including audited financial statements for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 and
unaudited interim financial statements), including by making available the
applicable personnel of Seller and its Affiliates who were involved in the
preparation of the Financial Statements and their outside auditors to provide
reasonable assistance and information in connection therewith, (b) assisting
Buyer (including by providing Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to the
Facility and the Real Property) in obtaining a survey or surveys of the Real
Property (in accordance with the 2016 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for
ALTA/NSPS Land Title Surveys) at Buyers sole cost and expense, and (c)
assisting Buyer in obtaining a Title Policy, at Buyers sole cost and expense
including, if required by the applicable title insurer, by delivering a
certificate to such title insurer, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to each of the Parties and the title insurer.

SECTION 5.20 _Insurance_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing
insurance in respect of the Acquired Assets and for any claims made in
connection with any losses from and after the Closing. Without limiting the
rights of Buyer set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, if any claims are made
or damages, losses or liabilities occur prior to the Closing Date that relate
to any of the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Facility, and
such claims, or the claims associated with such damages, losses or
liabilities, may be made against third-party insurance policies retained by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, then Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, if so requested by Buyer in writing, to ensure that after
the Closing Date Buyer can file, notice and otherwise continue to pursue such
claims and recover proceeds under the terms of such policies, provided,
however, that Buyer will reimburse Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable,
for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or
its Affiliates, including the payment of applicable deductible and retention
amounts, from and after the Closing as a result of assisting Buyer in seeking
insurance proceeds under a policy.

 



46 SECTION 5.21 _Amendment to Spread Strike Schedule_. To the extent that the
Closing has not occurred prior to December 31, 2017, then prior to the
Closing the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to amend _Schedule G_ so
that such Schedule includes a spread strike for each month through the month
that contains the fifth (5th) year anniversary of the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.22 _Firm Transportation Capacity Release_.

 

(a) The Parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable (i) for Seller to release the full
extent of its firm gas transportation capacity rights under the Firm
Transportation Agreement to Buyer pursuant to a pre-arranged capacity release
under the General Terms and Conditions of EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff for an
initial period of thirty-one (31) days beginning on the Closing Date whereby
Buyer is designated as the " _Pre-Arranged Shipper_ ," as such term is defined
in EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff (the " _Short-Term Pre-Arranged Capacity Release_
"), and (ii) to secure the agreement of EPNG, pursuant to Section 4.20(a) or
Section 9.10(c) of the General Terms and Conditions of EPNGs FERC Gas
Tariff, that Seller shall be relieved, as of the effective date of Pre-
Arranged Capacity Release, of any further liability for payment of charges
applicable to the capacity released under the Firm Transportation Agreement.
The terms of the Short-Term Pre-Arranged Capacity Release will be the same as
those terms contained in the Firm Transportation Agreement, as applicable, so
as to effectuate the release of the full extent of the capacity rights held by
Seller under the Firm Transportation Agreement for such period and to permit
the transfer of such capacity to Buyer. Seller shall not conduct an open
season or seek any bids from other potential shippers with respect to the
Short-Term Pre-Arranged Capacity Release. No later than one day before the
Closing Date, Seller shall deliver notice of the Short-Term Pre-Arranged
Capacity Release to EPNGs Electronic Bulletin Board or EBB (as such terms are
defined in EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff).

 

(b) During the term of the Short-Term Pre-Arranged Capacity Release, the
Parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable for Seller to release the full extent of its
firm gas transportation capacity rights under the Firm Transportation
Agreement to Buyer on a permanent basis pursuant to a pre-arranged capacity
release under the General Terms and Conditions of EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff
whereby Buyer is the " _Permanent Pre-Arranged Shipper_ ," as such term is
defined in EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff (the " _Pre-Arranged Capacity Release_ ").
The terms of the Permanent Pre-Arranged Capacity Release will be the same as
those terms contained in the Firm Transportation Agreement, as applicable, so
as to effectuate the release of all capacity rights held by Seller under the
Firm Transportation Agreement and to permit the transfer of such capacity to
Buyer. Seller shall not seek bids to compete with the non-rate provisions of
Buyers pre-arranged bid and shall conduct the shortest possible open season
permitted under the General Terms and Conditions of EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff.
Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall enter any bids into such open
season. Seller shall deliver notice of the Permanent Pre-Arranged Capacity
Release to EPNGs Electronic Bulletin Board or EBB (as such terms are defined
in EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff) as soon as practicable (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days following the Closing Date) and shall conduct the open
season process for the Pre-Arranged Capacity Release as soon as practicable
thereafter, consistent with the General Terms and Conditions of EPNGs FERC
Gas Tariff.

 



47 (c) Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against any and all damages, losses or liabilities arising out of
(i) Sellers agreement to structure its release of its firm gas transportation
capacity rights under the Firm Transportation Agreement to Buyer as a Pre-
Arranged Capacity Release subject to all of the terms and conditions of
Section 9 of the General Terms and Conditions of EPNGs FERC Gas Tariff and
(ii) EPNGs refusal to agree, as contemplated by _Section 5.22(a)(ii)_, that
Seller shall be relieved of any further liability for payment of charges
applicable to the capacity released under the Firm Transportation Agreement.

SECTION 8.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Buyer Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each, an "
_Indemnified Entity_ ") believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance
exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under this _Article 8_ (whether or not the amount of
Indemnifiable Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified
Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice
thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from which indemnification is
sought (the " _Indemnifying Entity_ ") (i) if the event or occurrence giving
rise to such claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim, suit,
action or proceeding brought by a Person not a Party or affiliated with any
such Party (a " _Third Party_ "), within twenty (20) Business Days following
receipt of notice of such claim, suit, action or proceeding by such
Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such
claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a claim, suit, action
or proceeding brought by a Third Party, as promptly as practicable after the
discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise to such
claim for indemnity; _provided_ , that in each case in clauses (i) and (ii),
that the failure to notify or delay in notifying the Indemnifying Entity, as
the case may be, will not relieve the Indemnifying Entity of its obligations
pursuant to this _Article 8_ , except to the extent that such Indemnifying
Entity is materially prejudiced as a result thereof. Each Claim Notice shall
describe the claim and the basis of such claim in reasonable detail.

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of an
action or claim described in _Section 8.03(a)(i)_, the Indemnifying Entity
shall be entitled to: (i) assume and have sole control over the defense of
such action or claim at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 8.03(b)_) and with its own counsel if it gives
written notice to the Indemnified Entity of its intention to do so and
acknowledges its unqualified obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Entity
as provided hereunder within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice
from the Indemnified Entity (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim
so requires); _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Entitys retention of
counsel shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Entity if such counsel creates a conflict of interest under applicable
standards of professional conduct and _provided_ , further that
the Indemnifying Entity shall not be entitled to assume and have control over
such defense if such action or claim arises in connection with a criminal
proceeding ( _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to
participate in such defense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Entity, at such Indemnifying Entitys sole cost and expense); and
(ii) negotiate a settlement or compromise of such action or claim; _provided_
, that (A) such settlement or compromise shall include a full and
unconditional waiver and release by the Third Party of all Indemnified
Entities (without any cost or liability of any nature whatsoever to such
Indemnified Entities) and (B) any such settlement or compromise shall be
permitted hereunder only with the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Entity, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If, within thirty (30) days following receipt from an Indemnified
Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party action or claim (or
sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying
Entity (i) advises such Indemnified Entity in writing that the
Indemnifying Entity shall not elect to defend, settle or compromise such
action or claim, (ii) is not entitled to assume and control the defense of
such action or claims, or (iii) fails to make

 



54  such an election in writing, then such Indemnified Entity may, at its
option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim;
_provided_ , that any such settlement or compromise shall be permitted
hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnifying Entity, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Unless and
until the Indemnifying Entity makes an election in accordance with this
_Section 8.03(b)_ to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim, all
of the Indemnified Entitys reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the
defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or claim shall
be Indemnifiable Losses subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent
provided herein. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the
Indemnifying Entity all information reasonably available to such Indemnified
Entity relating to such action or claim, except as may be prohibited by
applicable Law or necessary to protect any privilege. In addition, the Parties
shall render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such action or claim.
The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully and
timely apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement
negotiations with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Entity elects to
defend any such action or claim, then the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled
to participate in such defense (which participation rights shall include the
right to attend any meetings with a Third Party or hearings or proceedings
before any Governmental Entity to the extent they relate to such claim and to
receive promptly copies of all pleadings, notices and communications related
to such claim) with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity,
at such Indemnified Entitys sole cost and expense except if (i) a conflict
of interest in relation to such action or claim exists between the
Indemnifying Entity and the Indemnified Entity in the reasonable judgment of
the Indemnified Entity or (ii) such action or claims seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against the Indemnified Entity. The Indemnifying Entity must
conduct its defense of any Third Party Claim described herein reasonably
actively and diligently in order to preserve its rights in this _Section
8.03(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, _Section 5.03(b)_ and not
this _Section 8.03(b)_ shall govern the conduct of any Tax Contest.

 

SECTION 8.04 _Indemnification Generally_.

 

(a) The amount which the Indemnifying Entity is or may be required to pay to
any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this _Article 8_ shall be reduced
(retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds or other amounts
actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity related to the
related Indemnifiable Losses (net of any costs and expenses incurred in
pursuing such claim (including increases in insurance premiums as a result of
such claims)). If an Indemnified Entity shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Entity in respect of
Indemnifiable Losses (including any Purchase Price adjustment with respect to
the circumstances giving rise to such payment under this _Article 8_ ) and
shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of
such Indemnifiable Losses, then such Indemnified Entity shall promptly repay
to the Indemnifying Entity a sum equal to the amount of such insurance
proceeds or other amounts actually received (net of any costs and expenses
incurred in pursuing such claim (including increases in insurance premiums as
a result of such claims)).

(b) In addition to the requirements of _Section 8.04(a)_, each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification
under this _Article 8_ to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to give rise to such Indemnifiable Losses.

 



55 (c) Except for the rights and remedies set forth in _Section 2.10_ (Post-
Closing Adjustment), _Section 2.11_ (Earnout), _Section 5.13_ (Non-
Solicitation; Confidentiality) and _Section 10.07_ (Specific Performance) and
claims of, or causes of action arising from Fraud: (i) the
indemnification provided in this _Article 8_ shall be the exclusive post-
Closing remedy available to any Party with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement; and (ii) in
furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Parties and its Affiliates hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against the other Party arising under or based upon this
Agreement or any certificate delivered in connection herewith (except with
respect to the rights and remedies set forth in this _Article 8_ ).

(d) To the extent permitted by Law, any indemnity payment under this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

(e) For purposes of determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss
hereunder (but not for the purpose of determining whether any breach has
occurred or whether any representation or warranty is inaccurate or is not
true and correct), the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of the Parties set forth in this Agreement or in any other document or
instrument delivered hereunder will be considered without regard to any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualification set forth therein.

(f) Neither Party will have any indemnification obligations relating to, and
none of the Indemnified Buyer Entities or the Indemnified Seller Entities
will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ for, any
Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that such Indemnifiable Losses were
included, or should have been included, in the calculation of the Closing
Date Net Working Capital Amount or the Closing Date Net Indebtedness Amount.

SECTION 8.05 _Setoff Permitted_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, and without prejudice to any other right or remedy it has or
may have, Buyer may set off or recoup the amount of Indemnifiable Losses
Seller or any of its Affiliates is required to pay to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates pursuant to this _Article 8_ against any Liability of Buyer to
Seller under _Section 2.11_ (Earnout); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) in
no event shall Buyer have any rights of set off under this _Section 8.05_
unless a final determination of the amount of Indemnifiable Losses has been
made and (b) any such setoff shall be subject to the limitations and other
provisions of this _Article 8_. A "final determination" will exist when (i)
the parties to the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, or (ii) a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction will have entered a final Order
or rendered a final determination with respect to disputes the parties have
agreed to submit thereto.

 



56 ARTICLE 9

 

TERMINATION

SECTION 9.01  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

(a) at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written agreement of Buyer
and Seller;

(b) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
prior to the date that is the six (6) month anniversary of the date hereof
(the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that (i) so long as Buyer and/or any of
its Affiliates have not entered into a Subsequent Transaction, neither Seller
nor Buyer shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)_
until the date that is the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof if
at the Outside Date all of the conditions to Closing have been satisfied (or
are capable of being satisfied) other than the condition set forth in
_Section 6.01(a)_ with respect to the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act and (ii) if Buyer and/or any of its
Affiliates has entered into a Subsequent Transaction, Buyer shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(b)_ until the date
that is the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date hereof if at the Outside
Date all of the conditions to Closing have been satisfied (or are capable of
being satisfied) other than the condition set forth in _Section 6.01(a)_ with
respect to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act or the condition set forth in _Section 6.01(b)_ with respect to any
Order by the PUCT or otherwise related to the PUCT or PURA; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
9.01(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been, directly or indirectly, the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Outside Date (as the same may be extended pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii));

 

(c) by either Buyer or Seller by giving written notice to the other Party if
any Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken any other action
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order,
decree or ruling or other action shall not be subject to appeal or shall have
become final and non-appealable;

(d) by either Buyer or Seller by giving written notice to the other Party if
there has been a breach by such other Party of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in this Agreement and, assuming Closing were to occur on
the day on which such written notice is provided pursuant to this _Section
9.01(d)_, such breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of
the conditions to Closing of the Party sending such notice (set forth in
_Section 6.02_ or _Section 6.03_, as applicable) and such breach is
incapable of being cured or, if of a character that is capable of being
cured, is not cured by the breaching Party within the earlier of (i) thirty
(30) days of its receipt of such written notice from the other Party or (ii)
the number of days remaining prior to the Outside Date; or

 

(e) by either Buyer or Seller pursuant to _Section 5.10(d)_ by giving written
notice to the other Party.

 

SECTION 9.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by _Section 9.01(a)_ through
_(e)_ , such termination shall be without liability of any Party to the other
Parties for any breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements under this Agreement prior to such termination, except to the
extent set forth in _Section 9.02(c)_.

 



57 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Party pursuant to _Section
9.01_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any Party, _provided_ , that Buyer, at its option, shall
either (i) return all documents and other material received from Seller, its
Affiliates or their advisors or representatives relating to the Facility, the
Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether so obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement, to Seller, or (ii) destroy all copies of the foregoing documents
and materials, and deliver a certificate to Seller confirming such
destruction, and, in either case, shall continue to treat all confidential
information received by Buyer and its Affiliates and their Representatives
with respect to the Facility, the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the termination hereof.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement shall become null and void
and of no further force and effect, except for the following provisions which
shall survive such termination: _Section 5.04(b)_ (Publicity); _Section
5.06_ (Expenses); _Section 9.01_ (Termination); this _Section 9.02_ (Effect
of Termination) and _Article 10_ (Miscellaneous). Nothing in this _Section
9.02_ shall be deemed to release any Party from any Liability to the other
Party for any breach by such Party of the covenants and other agreements of
this Agreement occurring prior to such termination or to impair the right of
any Party to compel specific performance by any other Party of its obligations
under this Agreement.

SECTION 10.02 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
(a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order
to carry out, to the extent valid or enforceable, such provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall, taken together, be considered one and the same agreement. Delivery of
an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic
image scan transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 



59 SECTION 10.04 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer and Seller. Each
Party may, by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party, waive
compliance by any other Party with any term or provision of this Agreement
that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform. No
failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

 

SECTION 10.05 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement (together with the written agreements, Schedules and certificates
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto), constitute the entire
agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in _Section 5.14_ or in _Article 8_ , this Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and is not intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder.

SECTION 10.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

SECTION 10.07 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms and that any remedy at law
for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be inadequate.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

SECTION 10.08 _Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that the appropriate, exclusive and convenient forum ("
_Forum_ ") for any other disputes between any of the Parties hereto arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby is
the Court of Chancery in the City of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware
except where such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. In such event, the
Forum is in the federal district court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware or, in
the event such federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then
in the Superior Court in the City of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware.
Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the
Forum in respect of any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties further agree that the
Parties will not bring suit with respect to any disputes arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court
or jurisdiction other than the Forum. The preceding sentence will not limit
the rights of the Parties to obtain execution of a

 



60  judgment in any other jurisdiction. The Parties further agree, to the extent
permitted by Law, that a final and non-appealable judgment against a Party in
any proceeding contemplated in this  _Section 10.08_ will be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which will be
conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

(b) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of the Forum. Each of the Parties hereby consents to process
being served by any Party in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery
of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.01_.

(c) EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

SECTION 10.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto without
the prior written consent of Seller, in the case of Buyer, and Buyer, in the
case of Seller; _provided_ , that, (a) without such prior written consent,
Seller may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or obligations
hereunder (including Sellers right to seek indemnification hereunder) to any
Affiliate or Affiliates of Seller so long as Seller and Seller Guarantor
(subject to _Section 10.15_) retain ultimate liability for all obligations
of Seller pursuant to this Agreement and (b) without such prior written
consent, Buyer may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or obligations
hereunder (including Buyers right to seek indemnification hereunder) to
any Affiliate or Affiliates of Buyer so long as Buyer and Buyer Guarantor
(subject to _Section 10.14_) retain ultimate liability for all obligations of
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Upon any such permitted assignment, the
references in this Agreement to such Party shall also apply to any such
assignee unless the context otherwise requires. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this _Section
10.09_ shall be null and void, _ab initio_.

 

SECTION 10.10 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.11 _Schedules and Exhibits_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, all Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to
be and hereby are made a part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in the Seller
Disclosure Letter or Buyer Disclosure Letter corresponding to and qualifying a
specific numbered paragraph or section hereof shall be deemed to correspond
to and qualify such numbered paragraph or section and any other numbered
paragraph or section with respect to which applicability of such disclosure is
readily

 



61  apparent on its face. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is
included solely for informational purposes, is not an admission of liability
with respect to the matters covered by the information, and may not be
required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The specification of any
dollar amount in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the Schedules is
not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or lower amounts) are or
are not material.

SECTION 10.12 _Bulk Sales Laws_. Each Party hereby waives compliance by the
Parties with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" and similar
Laws set forth in Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as it is in effect
in the states where the Acquired Assets are located and all other similar
Laws of any Governmental Entity other than bulk-transfer tax notice
provisions.

 

SECTION 10.13 _Conflict of Interest; Privilege_.

 

(a) _Conflict of Interest_. If Seller so desires, and without the need for any
consent or waiver by Buyer, Jones Day is permitted to represent Seller or any
of its Affiliates after the Closing in connection with any matter, including
any matter related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
disagreement or dispute relating thereto.

 

(b) With respect to any attorney-client and work product privileges belonging
to a Party with respect to the Facility, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities (collectively, " _Privileges_ ") for matters relating to the
business records, documents, communications or other information
(collectively, " _Information_ ") of Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including the Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities, to the
extent prepared in connection with this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (" _Acquisition
Information_ "), Seller will have sole authority to determine whether to
assert or waive any Privileges, including the right to assert any Privilege
against Buyer and its Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates will take no action
without the prior written consent of Seller that would reasonably be expected
to result in any waiver of any such Privileges of Seller relating to the
Acquisition Information. After the Closing, Buyer will have sole authority to
determine whether to assert or waive any Privileges with respect to
Information relating to the Facility, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities other than the Acquisition Information, and Seller and its
Affiliates will take no action after the Closing without the prior written
consent of Buyer that would reasonably be expected to result in any waiver of
any such Privileges of Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will not
assert any Privileges related to (i) pre-Closing Information, advice or
communications relating to the Facility, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities against Seller or its Affiliates or (ii) Privileged Information to
the extent relating to the Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities.

 

(c) The rights and obligations created by _Section 10.13(b)_ and this
_Section 10.13(c)_ will apply to all Information as to which Seller or any
of its Affiliates would be entitled to assert or has asserted a Privilege (the
" _Privileged Information_ "). Upon receipt by Seller or its Affiliates, or
Buyer or its Affiliates, of, or any such Person becomes aware that a current
or former employee of such Person has received, any subpoena, discovery or
other request from any Person that actually or arguably calls for the
production or disclosure of Privileged Information of one or more of the
other Parties, Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, will promptly notify the

 



62  other Party of the existence of the request and will provide such other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review the Privileged Information and to
assert any rights it may have under  _Section 10.13(b)_ or otherwise to
prevent the production or disclosure of any such Privileged Information.
Sellers transfer of any Information to Buyer in accordance with this
Agreement and Sellers agreement to permit Buyer to obtain Information
existing prior to the Closing are made in reliance on the Parties respective
agreements to maintain the confidentiality of such Information in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.04_ and to take the steps
provided herein for the preservation of all Privileges that may belong to or
be asserted by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, as set forth in this
_Section 10.13_. The access to Information being granted pursuant to
this Agreement, including _Sections 5.01_ , _5.05_ and _5.19_ , and the
disclosure to Buyer or Seller of Privileged Information relating to the
Facility, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities or any of other
business of Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby will not be asserted by Buyer or
Seller to constitute, or otherwise be deemed, a waiver of any Privilege that
has been or may be asserted under  _Section 10.13(b)_, this _Section
10.13(c)_ or otherwise.

SECTION 10.14 _Buyer Guaranty_.

 

(a) Buyer Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a
principal and not as a surety, to Seller the prompt and full performance and
payment of Buyers obligations under this Agreement (the " _Buyer Obligations_
"), and Seller hereby agrees and acknowledges that Buyer Guarantor is a
signatory to this Agreement solely for such purpose. Seller may seek remedies
directly from Buyer Guarantor with respect to the Buyer Obligations without
first exhausting its remedies against Buyer. The liability of Buyer Guarantor
hereunder is, in all cases, subject to all defenses, setoffs and
counterclaims available to Buyer with respect to performance or payment of
the Buyer Obligations. Buyer Guarantor waives presentment, demand and any
other notice with respect to any of the Buyer Obligations and any defenses
that Buyer Guarantor may have with respect to any of the Buyer Obligations
other than as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the guarantee set forth in this
_Section 10.14_ shall terminate and be of no further force or effect upon
the earlier to occur of (i) the Closing and (ii) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, except that the obligations of Buyer Guarantor
shall terminate thirty (30) days following the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ (unless a Claim is made hereunder prior to the
end of such thirty (30) day period, in which case the obligations pursuant to
this _Section 10.14_ shall terminate upon the resolution of such Claim).

(b) For purposes of _Sections 10.01_ through _10.10_ , Buyer Guarantor
shall be deemed to be a Party.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer
Guarantors aggregate obligations pursuant to this _Section 10.14_ shall not
exceed the Purchase Price.

 



63 SECTION 10.15 _Seller Guaranty_.

 

(a) Seller Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as a
principal and not as a surety, to Buyer the prompt and full payment of
Sellers monetary obligations under this Agreement that are required to be
paid by Seller from and after the Closing (the " _Seller Obligations_ "), and
Buyer hereby agrees and acknowledges that Seller Guarantor is a signatory to
this Agreement solely for such purpose. Buyer may seek remedies directly from
Seller Guarantor with respect to the Seller Obligations without first
exhausting its remedies against Seller. The liability of Seller Guarantor
hereunder is, in all cases, subject to all defenses, setoffs and
counterclaims available to Seller with respect to performance or payment of
the Seller Obligations and limitations contained in this Agreement. Seller
Guarantor waives presentment, demand and any other notice with respect to any
of the Seller Obligations and any defenses that Seller Guarantor may have with
respect to any of the Seller Obligations other than as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the guarantee set forth in this _Section 10.15_ shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect upon (i) with respect to the
indemnification obligations set forth in (A) _Sections 8.01(a)(iii)_ and
_8.01(a)(iv),_ the date that is thirty (30) days after the fourth (4th)
anniversary of the Closing Date or (B) with respect to a breach of the
covenant set forth in _Section 5.13(a) (Non-Solicitation_), the date that is
thirty (30) days after the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii)
with respect to any indemnification obligations arising out of the breach of
any pre-Closing covenant or agreement of the Seller set forth herein, the date
that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date and (iii) with respect to all
representations, warranties and all other obligations of the Seller
hereunder, the earlier of (A) the date on which such representations,
warranties or other obligations of Seller no longer survive in accordance with
_Section 7.01_ and (B) the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date
(unless, in each case, a Claim is made hereunder prior to the end of such
survival period, in which case the obligations pursuant to this _Section
10.15_ shall terminate upon the resolution of such Claim).

(b) For purposes of _Sections 10.01_ through _10.10_ , Seller Guarantor shall
be deemed to be a Party.

WHEREAS, Buyer and Seller now desire to carry out the intent and purpose of

 _AGREEMENT_

1\. _Assignment of Assumed Contracts_. On the terms and subject to the

accepts and agrees to discharge or perform when due in accordance with their
respective terms and subject to the respective conditions thereof, the
Liabilities under the Assumed Contracts and all other Assumed Liabilities.

 

3\. _Asset Purchase Agreement_. This Agreement is being executed and delivered
pursuant to and is subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the
Asset Purchase Agreement, and all of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the Seller and Buyer contained therein, all of
which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Assignment Agreement
in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, defeat, limit, alter or impair,
enhance or enlarge any right, obligation, claim or remedy created by the Asset
Purchase Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement shall control and
prevail.

 



D-1 4\. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, including their successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy

compliance by any other Party with any term or provision of this Agreement
that such other Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform. No

herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

 

7\. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving

8\. _Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial._

 

(a) The Parties agree that the Forum for any other disputes between any of the
Parties hereto arising out of or related to this Agreement or the

Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware except where such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction. In such event, the Forum is in the federal district court
sitting in Wilmington, Delaware or, in the event such federal district court
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, then in the Superior Court in the City of
Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware. Each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the Forum in respect of any
disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties further agree that the Parties will not bring
suit with respect to any disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in any court or jurisdiction other
than the Forum. The preceding sentence will not limit the rights of the
Parties to obtain execution of a judgment in any other jurisdiction.
The Parties further agree, to the extent permitted by Law, that a final and
non-appealable judgment against a Party in any proceeding contemplated in this
Section 8 will be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction
within or outside the United States by suit on the judgment, a certified or
exemplified copy of which will be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount
of such judgment.

 



D-2 (b) To the extent that any Party has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property,
each such Party hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its
obligations with respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal
jurisdiction of the Forum. Each of the Parties hereby consents to process
being served by any Party in any suit, action or proceeding by the delivery
of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.01 of the
Asset Purchase Agreement.

(c) EACH PARTY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 _Form of License Agreement_

 

LICENSE AGREEMENT

This License Agreement (" _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into effective
as of [ _ _], 2017 (the " _Effective Date_ ") by and between
Odessa-Ector Power Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("
_Licensor_ ") and La Frontera Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company(" _Licensee_ "). Licensee and Licensor are sometimes hereinafter
referred to collectively as the " _Parties_ " and singularly as a " _Party_
".

WHEREAS, Licensor and Licensee, among others, are parties to an Asset
Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 5, 2017 (the " _APA_ ");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the APA, Licensor has acquired an approximately 1000
megawatt combined cycle, combustion turbine power plant located in Odessa,
Texas (the " _Facility_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Facility is benefitted by certain natural gas pipeline easements
upon which pipelines have been constructed so as to transport natural gas to
the Facility;

WHEREAS, although the APA contemplated the assignment of the aforementioned
easements to Licensee, some of such easements, as identified on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto (each, an " _Easement_ " and, collectively, the " _Easements_
"), require the consent of the grantors thereof prior to the effective
assignment of such Easements to Licensee, which consent has not, as of the
date hereof, been obtained by the Parties; and

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to enter into this Agreement to permit Licensee to
benefit from the use of the Easements, without assuming legal or equitable
title therein or thereto, for the transmission of natural gas to the Facility
until such time as the grantors consent to the assignment of each Easement
to Licensee has been obtained.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and
obligations contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

LICENSE

Section 1.01  _License Grant_. The Parties acknowledge that Licensor is and
shall remain throughout the Term the holder of legal title in and to the
Easements in accordance with their terms. Pursuant to Section 2.06 of the APA,
the Parties have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
consent of each of the grantors of the Easements to the assignment thereof to
Buyer, but as of the date hereof, such consents have not been obtained.
Accordingly, with respect to each Easement, until such consent is obtained,
Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual, non-exclusive license and
privilege to access, use and otherwise enjoy the benefits of the Licensors
rights under each Easement in furtherance of Licensees ownership, operation,
repair, maintenance, replacement and removal of the pipelines for the
provision of natural gas to the Facility, all as contemplated by this
Agreement and the APA, to the fullest extent such rights may be exercised by
any other licensee or invitee of Licensor under the Easements (the
"License"); provided, however, that the License shall only be deemed to have
been granted

 



G-1  hereby if and to the extent the grant thereof does not (a) breach or
otherwise violate, or result in a default or event of default under, the
Easements, or (b) violate applicable law or legal requirements. With respect
to any portion or portions of the Easements to which the License cannot be
granted pursuant to the foregoing sentence, Licensor shall be deemed to have
agreed to hold such portion or portions of the Easements, and the rights and
benefits of ownership thereof, in trust for the benefit of Licensee until such
time as the applicable consent is obtained. Without limiting the foregoing,
Licensee shall undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding Liabilities
(as defined in the APA) for the use of each Easement to the extent Licensee
would have been responsible therefor if a consent to assign any such Easement
had been obtained and full legal and/or equitable title in and to such
Easement was assigned to Licensee. Further, Licensee shall at all times
comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Easements
relating to the use thereof (as though it were the grantee thereunder) and
neither Party shall take any action to terminate any Easement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Agreement is
not intended to and does not grant or create an easement, servitude or other
real property interest, but creates a license only, and Licensee acknowledges
that Licensee does not and shall not claim at any time any real property
interest or estate of any kind or extent whatsoever in the Easements by virtue
of this Agreement or Licensees use or occupancy of the Easements. In
connection with the foregoing, the Parties further acknowledge that in no
event shall the relationship between Licensor and Licensee be deemed to be a
so-called landlord-tenant relationship and that in no event shall Licensee be
entitled to avail itself of any rights afforded to tenants under the laws of
the state in which the Easements are located.

Section 1.02 _Term_. The License to Licensee shall continue as to each
Easement until such time as consent to assign any such Easement has been
obtained and Licensors full legal title in and to any such Easement has been
assigned to Licensee (the " _Term_ "). If and only if the Parties have
obtained the consent of the grantor of any Easement to the assignment thereof
to the Licensee (or, if sooner, any unassigned Easement has expired by its
terms) then this Agreement and the License herein granted shall be terminated
with respect to any such Easement, without further action by any Party, but
this Agreement shall in all events remain in full force and effect until
Licensor has obtained grantor consent to the assignment of the last such
Easement or the last such unassigned Easement has expired by it terms.

ARTICLE 2

 

INSURANCE

Section 2.01  _Licensee s Insurance_. At all times during the Term, Licensee
shall, at its sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonably efforts to
maintain, or cause to be maintained, in full force and effect a comprehensive
public liability insurance policy naming Licensor, as an additional insured,
covering death of or injury to persons or damage to property (with limits not
less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) per occurrence) arising out of the
use of the Easements or the activities of Licensee or its employees, agents
or invitees in relation thereto. In addition, Licensee shall maintain its own
insurance covering the pipeline equipment and related assets, against any
casualty (it being understood that Licensor shall not be liable to Licensee
in respect of any of such pipeline equipment and related assets nor casualty
thereto unless caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Licensor).

 



G-2 ARTICLE 3

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 3.01 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party herein waives its respective
right to any jury trial with respect to any litigation arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement.

 

Section 3.02 _No Third Party Beneficiary_. This Agreement shall not be
construed to create any third party beneficiary relationship in favor of
anyone not a party to this Agreement. In addition, the Parties waive and
disclaim any third party beneficiary status as to any of the contracts of the
other Party.

 

Section 3.03 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to any
principles of conflicts of laws that would render such law inapplicable.

Section 3.04 _Modifications_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the Parties, which shall not be modified except by writing signed by
the Parties. Neither Party has made any representations to the other except as
specifically set forth herein or in the APA.

 

Section 3.05 _Recitals, Headings and Titles_. The captions in this Agreement
are for the convenience of the Parties in the identification of the
provisions hereof and shall not constitute a part of the Agreement nor be
considered interpretive thereof.

Section 3.06  _Assignment_.

(a) This Agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the successors,
assigns, heirs, personal representatives and representatives in bankruptcy of
the Parties hereto. Neither Party shall sell, assign, or convey this Agreement
or any interest or part thereof without the prior written consent of the
other, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

 

(b) Licensor covenants and agrees that it shall not transfer, assign,
encumber, modify or terminate any Easement without the prior written consent
of Licensee.

Section 3.07 _Indemnification_. Licensee acknowledges that Licensor is
entering into this Agreement as an accommodation to Licensee, and accordingly
Licensee shall indemnify Licensor from any damages, losses or claims arising
from performance or non-performance of this Agreement except for those
resulting from Licensors gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 3.08 _Damages_. In the event a Party breaches any provision of this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to recover from the
other Party the direct actual damages, if any, suffered by the non-breaching
Party as a consequence of the other Partys breach. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, no Party shall be liable under this Agreement,
except in the case of fraud, for (i) punitive or exemplary damages or losses
calculated by reference to any multiple of (A) earnings or earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation or amortization or (B) other financial metric or
(ii) special, consequential or indirect damages or lost profits that are not
the reasonably foreseeable result of a breach of this

 



G-3  Agreement, in each case, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability,
other law or otherwise and whether or not arising from the other Partys sole,
joint or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault for any
matter relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to third-party claims
for which any Party is obligated to indemnify another Person hereunder.
