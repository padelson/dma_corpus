conditions at the Closing, the parties to this Agreement shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by, and
executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and
time of such filing, or such later time as shall be agreed by Parent and the
Company and specified in such filing, being the "Effective Time"). Prior to
such filing, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at the offices of Akin
Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, One Bryant Park, New York, New York 10036 at
8:00 A.M. (Eastern Time), or such other place and time as the parties shall
agree, for the purpose of confirming the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits of
such conditions as the case may be, of the conditions set forth in Article VI.

Section 2.03 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to such provisions of
the DGCL, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving

disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the

Section 2.04 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time, (i)
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit B (the "Surviving
Corporation Certificate of Incorporation") and, as so amended and restated,
will be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided by law and such Surviving Corporation
Certificate of Incorporation and (ii) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated to read in their entirety as set forth in
Exhibit C (the "Surviving Corporation Bylaws") and, as so amended and
restated, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided by law, the Surviving Corporation Certificate of
Incorporation and such bylaws.

Section 2.05 Directors and Officers. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Surviving Corporation
Certificate of Incorporation and the Surviving Corporation Bylaws and the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall



11 

be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 2.06 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company, Parent
or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any Company Common Shares held by any Subsidiary of
the Company but excluding any Company Common Shares described in Section
2.06(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall (i) automatically be canceled
and retired and (ii) upon the surrender of the Certificate representing such
Company Common Share (along with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal (as
defined below) and duly completed form W-9 pursuant to Section 2.09(a)),
automatically be converted into the right to receive in cash, without
interest, an amount equal to the Per Share Amount.

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company (excluding any
Company Common Shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company) and each Company
Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and retired without any conversion of such Company Shares, and no payment or
distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be delivered
with respect to any such Company Shares.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company pays a dividend in, splits, combines into a smaller number of shares,
or issues by reclassification any Company Shares (or undertakes a similar
act), the Per Share Amount will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the
holders the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action and, as so adjusted, will from and after the date of such event,
be the Per Share Amount, subject to further adjustments based on this Section
2.06(d).

Section 2.07 Deposit of Consideration. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the Securityholders, an amount in cash equal to the Consideration.

Section 2.08 No Set-Off. The obligation of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
make any payments to any Securityholder, or under any agreements entered into
in connection with this Agreement, shall not be subject to any right of set-
off, restriction, condition or deduction against any of the Company's or any
Securityholders' obligations whatsoever (including on account of any
counterclaim or the Company's or any Securityholders' breach, bankruptcy or
otherwise), and Parent hereby irrevocably waives any and all such rights.



12 

Section 2.09 Dissenting Company Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if and to
the extent required by the DGCL, Company Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
Securityholders who have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto
in writing and who have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such
Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the
"Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the applicable consideration due to such holder pursuant to
Section 2.06(a) above. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of
Dissenting Company Shares ("Dissenting Stockholder") shall not have and shall
not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a
stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. Such Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Company
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by Securityholders who
shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost
their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section
262 shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
applicable consideration due to such holder pursuant to Section 2.06(a) above,
without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in
Section 2.06(a), of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced
such Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, the right
of any Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the appraised value of the applicable
Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments, notices, petitions, or other communication received from
stockholders or provided to stockholders by the Company with respect to any
Dissenting Company Shares or shares claimed to be Dissenting Company Shares,
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 2.10 Payment and Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Payment Procedures. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall mail to
each Securityholder: (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent)
("Letter of Transmittal") and (B) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates in exchange for the amounts payable to such Securityholder
pursuant to Section 2.06(a) above. Prior to the Closing Date, the Paying
Agent, Parent and the Company shall enter into a Paying Agent Agreement, which
shall include a schedule prepared by the Company allocating the Consideration
among the applicable payees and otherwise be reasonably acceptable to Parent
and the Company (the "Paying Agent Agreement"). At the Effective Time and upon
delivery by such Securityholder to the Paying



13 

Agent of (x) all of such Securityholder's Certificates, (y) a Letter of
Transmittal duly executed by such Securityholder and (z) a form W-9, or
appropriate form W-8, as applicable, and any accompanying withholding
statements, duly completed by such Securityholder, the Paying Agent shall pay
to each Securityholder cash equal to the Per Share Amount in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof and the terms and conditions of the Paying
Agent Agreement. The Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be canceled.

(b) Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether represented by a
Certificate or in book entry-form) shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by
applicable Law.

(c) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and subject to such other
reasonable conditions as the Paying Agent may impose, and, if required by the
Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Paying Agent or Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it and/or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, pay to the Person entitled to such
payment the Per Share Amount due to such Person pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II.

(d) Any portion of the Consideration (including any investment income thereon)
deposited with the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the Securityholders
one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, and any such
Securityholder who has not exchanged his or her Company Shares for the
applicable Per Share Amount in accordance with this Agreement prior to that
time will thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the applicable Per
Share Amount in respect of such Securityholder's canceled and retired Company
Shares.

Section 2.11 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to Article II of this Agreement to any Securityholder such amounts as
are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code ("Treasury
Regulations"), or any provision of state or local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and (if required) remitted to
the applicable Government Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Securityholder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company

the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to

State of Delaware, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,

relating to creditors' rights generally or by principles of equity.

Section 3.04 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

party or by which any property or asset of the Company or the Transferred
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, except in the case of clause (ii) and (iii)
above, for any such conflicts, violations or other occurrences which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of the
Company to perform any material obligation under this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger without material delay or impairment.



17

Governmental Authorities set forth on Section 3.04(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Required Approvals") and (ii) where the

consummate the Merger without material delay or impairment.

38 

Section 5.04 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Person") acting in such capacities as provided in their
respective Constituent Documents and any indemnification or other agreements
of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement (to the extent that copies have been made available to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement) shall be assumed by the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time, and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to comply with and honor the foregoing obligations; provided, that such
obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under
applicable Law. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, take any
steps that would reasonably be expected to affect materially and adversely the
rights of any Indemnified Person.

Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the
Company (provided, that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured)
with respect to claims against the present and former officers and directors
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and claims against any of the
present and former members of the Nominating Committee (as defined in the
Shareholder Agreement), in each case arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that Parent shall not be
obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 150% of the
aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would
at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be maintained
policies of insurance which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In
lieu of the foregoing, the Company may in consultation with Parent (and at the
request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to)
obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the
Company's existing directors and officers insurance policy (or a six-year
"tail" policy with a substantially comparable insurer) providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that
the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed
the Premium Cap.

Section 5.05 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, becoming aware of a material breach

reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to perform any material obligation under
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger without material delay or
impairment.

Section 5.06 Consents and Approvals.

(a) The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts, and
shall cooperate fully with each other (i) to comply as promptly as practicable
with all requirements of Governmental Authorities applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain as promptly as
practicable all necessary permits, orders or other consents, approvals or
authorization of Governmental Authorities and consents or waivers of all other
third parties necessary in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Company Required
Approvals and the Parent Required Approvals); provided, that Parent shall be
responsible for the costs (including any license or other fees and expenses)
associated with obtaining any such consents or waivers from such other third
parties or the replacement of the rights to which any such consents or waivers
relate. In connection therewith, each of the Company and Parent shall make and
shall each cause its Affiliates to make, at its respective expense, all
legally required filings as promptly as practicable in order to facilitate
prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall
provide and shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide such
information and communications to Governmental Authorities as such
Governmental Entities may request, shall take and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to take all steps that are necessary, proper or advisable to avoid
any Action by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, shall defend or contest in good faith any
Action by any third party (including any Governmental Authority), whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or that could otherwise prevent, impede, interfere with,
hinder or delay in any material respect the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including by using its reasonable best efforts to have
vacated or reversed any stay or temporary restraining order entered with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to agree to any limitation,
requirement or condition that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to (i) materially impair or interfere with the ability
of Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to conduct
their respective businesses, taken as a whole, after the Closing substantially
in the manner such businesses were conducted as of the date hereof, (ii)
result in the sale, lease, license, disposal or holding separate (x) by Parent
or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) of any capital
stock after the Closing or (y) by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) of any of their material assets, rights, product
lines, licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations or
interests therein, (iii) require any material capital contribution, capital
support arrangement or guarantee for the benefit of the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries, or (v) materially and adversely affect the benefits,
taken as a whole, that Parent would otherwise receive from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (each of the foregoing, a "Burdensome
Condition"). Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of
information, each of the parties shall provide to the other party copies of
all applications or other communications to



40 

Governmental Authorities in connection with this Agreement in advance of the
filing or submission thereof.

(b) Parent shall have responsibility for the filing fees associated with its
change of control application and Parent and the Company shall have
responsibility for their other respective filing fees associated with any
other required filings; provided that any filings fees related to competition
or antitrust filings shall be borne equally by each of Parent and the Company.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.06(a), within twenty (20)
Business Days after the date hereof (or, with respect to any necessary "Form
E" filings, thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof), Parent shall
file with all applicable Domiciliary Regulators or other applicable insurance
regulatory bodies requests for approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, which requests shall include all required exhibits.

(d) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, each of
the parties shall provide to the other party copies of all applications or
other communications to Governmental Authorities in connection with this
Agreement a reasonable time prior in advance of the filing or submission
thereof. Each party shall be given a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments thereon, which comments shall be considered by the other parties in
good faith. Each party shall give to the other party prompt written notice if
it receives any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, in
the case of any such notice or communication which is in writing, shall
promptly furnish the other party with a copy thereof. If any Governmental
Authority requires that a hearing be held in connection with any such
approval, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for such
hearing to be held promptly after the notice that such hearing is required has
been received by such party. Each party shall give to the other party
reasonable prior written notice of the time and place when any meetings,
telephone calls or other conferences may be held by it with any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and the other party shall have the right to have a representative or
representatives attend or otherwise participate in any such meeting, telephone
call or other conference.

(e) To the extent of any other consents or approvals from, or notices to, any
third party that is not a Governmental Authority that would be appropriate to
receive or deliver under any Material Contract, Real Property Lease or Ceded
Reinsurance (but not necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), the Company and the Parent shall each use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate fully with each other, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all such consents and approvals and deliver
as promptly as practicable all such notices. No party shall be obligated to
expend more than de minimis costs and expenses with respect to any consent,
approval or notice referenced in this Section 5.06(e).

Section 5.07 Antitrust Notifications.

(a) As promptly as possible after the date of this Agreement, but in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, if
required by any Law, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice a pre-merger notification in accordance



41 

with the HSR Act with respect to the Merger pursuant to this Agreement, and
shall file an antitrust notification in any other jurisdiction if required by
any Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall request, in such party's pre-
merger notification filed in accordance with the HSR Act, early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the
Company shall furnish promptly to the FTC, the Antitrust Division and any
other requesting Governmental Authority any additional information requested
by either of them pursuant to the HSR Act or any other antitrust notification
in connection with such filings. Subject to applicable Law and all privileges,
including the attorney-client privilege, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the making of all such
filings or responses, including providing copies of all such documents to the
other party and its advisors prior to filing or responding.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain any necessary approval from any Governmental Authority responsible for
merger control, antitrust or competition Law or to prevent the initiation of
any lawsuit by any Governmental Authority under any merger control, antitrust
or competition Law or to prevent the entry of any decree, judgment, injunction
preliminary or permanent, or any order that would otherwise make the Merger
unlawful; provided that the foregoing shall not require Parent to: (i) dispose
or transfer any material asset, including those of Parent, Merger Sub, Company
or their respective Affiliates; (ii) hold separate any material assets or
operations (either before or after the Effective Time) of Parent, Merger Sub,
Company or their respective Affiliates; or (iii) materially change or modify
any course of conduct or otherwise making any commitment to any Governmental
Authority regarding future operations of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or their
respective Affiliates' business, or (iv) defend, contest, or resist any action
or proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Governmental
Authority under any merger control, antitrust or competition Law.

Section 5.08 Further Assurances. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall
use its reasonable best efforts to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement, at the reasonable request of
another party to this Agreement, shall execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or desirable for effecting the consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.09 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company agree that no press
release or public announcement, statement or disclosure concerning the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued by
either party without the prior consent of the other parties, except as such
release or announcement may be required by Law, including the rules or
regulations of any United States or non-United States securities exchange, in
which case, the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its best efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

Section 5.10 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including with respect to Excess Employee Transaction Related
Payments, Excess Transaction Related Expenses and the fees set forth in
Section 5.06(b), all fees and expenses incurred in



42 

connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether
or not the Merger is consummated.

Section 5.11 Employees and Benefits.

(a) Unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and it shall cause
the Transferred Subsidiaries to, terminate the employment of all employees of
the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective
Time and conditioned upon the Closing, and the Company shall give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any release agreements provided to such
terminated employees of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries that are
required to become effective as a condition to receiving severance (including
adding language that makes clear that such release agreement includes a
release of any claims against Parent and its Affiliates).

(b) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation to
provide each employee of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time who continues employment with the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing Date (each, an "Employee" and collectively, the
"Employees") with (i) a base salary that is no less favorable than that set
forth for such Employee on Section 3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule;
(ii) a bonus opportunity for each Employee who remains employed following the
Closing Date during such one-year period in an amount that is no less
favorable than one-twelfth of the annual bonus opportunity for such Employee
set forth on Section 3.11(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule for each month
during such one-year period that such Employee remains employed (payable no
later than March 15th of the year following the year in which any such bonus
is earned); (iii) if an Employee incurs a termination during such one year
period that entitles him or her to severance benefits under such Employee's
employment agreement or under the CIFG Services, LLC Severance Plan, as
applicable, severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided
under such Employee's employment agreement or under the CIFG Services, LLC
Severance Plan, as applicable, based on such Employee's base salary or base
hourly rate and years of service set forth on Section 3.11(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; and (iv) benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its or
Parent's Affiliates, to pay all transaction bonuses, severance (including
under any employment agreement or under the CIFG Services, LLC Severance Plan)
and long-term incentives owed to Business Employees, including Business
Employees terminated pursuant to this Section 5.11, as required by the terms
of the applicable Plans (including under any employment agreement or under the
CIFG Services, LLC Severance Plan) and, with respect to transaction bonuses
and long-term incentives, in the amounts specified in Section 5.11(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, subject to the allocations contemplated by
Section 5.01(q) hereof. Such payment shall be made no earlier than the day
after the Closing Date and no later than the earlier to occur of (i) the date
that is the ninety (90) day anniversary of the Closing Date, or (ii) the date
that is the last date that such payment can be made as permitted pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code. To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code,
the Company agrees to take all actions necessary to amend any resolutions or



43 

plan terms that would otherwise require payment of transaction bonuses,
severance (including under any employment agreement or under the CIFG
Services, LLC Severance Plan) or long-term incentives prior to the Closing
Date.

(d) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Employees after the
Effective Time (the "New Plans"), each Employee will be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates before the Effective
Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for
which the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries have given credit for prior
service), to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under the corresponding Plan,
except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing
(i) each Employee will be immediately eligible following the Closing Date to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable
Plan in which such Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
(such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans") and (ii) if, an Old Plan that
provides medical, dental and vision insurance benefits is terminated prior to
the end of the plan year for such Old Plan during which the Closing Date
occurs, the Surviving Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered
dependents under such Old Plan that provides medical, dental and vision
insurance benefits during such shortened plan year prior to such termination
of the Old Plan to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, no
Employee shall be eligible to receive severance benefits pursuant to a plan
maintained by the Parent or its Affiliates during any period that such
Employee remains eligible for benefits under a Plan that provides severance
benefits.

(e) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company agrees to take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary or appropriate to withdraw as a participating employer in
the Paychex Plans, with such withdrawal effective as of the date immediately
prior to the Effective Time and conditioned upon the Closing, and, prior to
and conditioned upon such withdrawal as a participating employer, fully vest
any and all unvested amounts of the accounts of all Business Employees who are
participants at the time of such withdrawal; and the Company agrees to take
(or cause to be taken) all actions necessary to terminate any Plan (other than
a Paychex Plan and other than an employment agreement, bonus arrangement or
the CIFG Services, LLC Severance Plan) with such termination effective as of
the date immediately prior to the Effective Date and conditioned upon the
Closing.

(f) Unless otherwise requested by Parent in writing at least five days prior
to the Effective Time, the Company agrees to take (or cause to be taken) all
actions necessary or appropriate to terminate its service agreements with
Paychex and the participation of Business Employees in the Paychex Plans,
effective as of the Effective Time and conditioned upon the Closing.



44 

(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this
Section 5.11 (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall alter or limit Parent's or
its Affiliates' ability to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored
or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, (iii) is intended to confer upon
any current or former employee any right to employment or continued employment
for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a
particular term or condition of employment or (iv) is intended to confer upon
any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries
of employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

Section 5.12 No Solicitation.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize,
recommend, propose or enter into, either as the proposed surviving, merged,
acquiring or acquired corporation, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of any assets of
the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary (other than the purchase and
disposition of assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice) or any capital stock of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each, an
"Acquisition Transaction"), (ii) facilitate, solicit or initiate discussions,
negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person
any information concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of
the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary in connection with an Acquisition
Transaction or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, or facilitate, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do
or seek any of the foregoing.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with
any Persons (other than Parent and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with
respect to any Acquisition Transaction.

Section 5.13 Taxes.

(a) After the date of this Agreement, Company and Parent shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority or any judicial or administrative
proceeding relating to Taxes relating to the Company and any Transferred
Subsidiaries. All material Tax Returns of the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries that are filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing shall be submitted to Parent not later than 30 days prior to the due
date for the filing of such Tax Returns. Parent shall have the right to review
and propose revisions to such Tax Returns and to review and propose revisions
to all workpapers and procedures used to prepare any such Tax Return, and the
Company shall consider such proposed revisions in good faith. The Company
shall not take any position on any such Tax Return that is inconsistent with
the assumptions used in the calculation of the Company's gross deferred tax
assets or tax basis of any asset in the Statutory Statements or the footnotes
thereto (in each case, irrespective of any associated valuation allowances)
without Parent's express written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld.



45 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall own, and have all rights, title and
interest in, all books, records, documentation and other information in
existence as of the Closing Date related to any Tax or Tax item of the Company
or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, including all Tax Returns, books,
records (including information regarding ownership and Tax basis of property),
documentation and other information related to such Tax Returns and Tax
claims, including accompanying schedules, related work papers, and documents
related to rulings or other determinations by Governmental Authorities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Securityholders shall be entitled to retain copies of all federal Tax Returns
of the Company prepared on IRS Form 1120 and any comparable state Tax Returns
related to the income or operations of the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries and information, records and documents relating to the Taxes
reflected on such Tax Returns and the preparation of such Tax Returns. Upon
written request by any Securityholder, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide such Securityholder with a copy of the federal Tax
Return of the Company prepared on IRS Form 1120 for the period ending on the
Closing Date.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, including determination of any Tax item
attributable to a taxable year or period (or portion thereof) after the
Closing Date, Parent and the Company agree to treat (and cause the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries to treat) any gain, income, deductions, losses,
or other items (including, but not limited to, deductions with respect to
statutory loss reserves, severance payments and any other compensatory
payments) realized or accrued by the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries resulting from any transactions on the Closing Date following the
Closing as occurring on the day after the Closing Date and, if applicable, to
utilize (and cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to utilize) the "next day"
rule in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law) for purposes of reporting such
items on Tax Returns.

Section 5.14 Post-Closing Reorganization.

(a) Parent acknowledges that certain Securityholders are (or are Affiliated
with parties who are) beneficiaries of, or holders of transferable custodial
receipts as to which, a Secondary Market Insurance Contract has been issued by
one of the Insurance Subsidiaries (such Securityholders, collectively,
"Securityholder Beneficiaries" and each, a "Securityholder Beneficiary"), and
that they will derive certain benefit from the consummation of the Post-
Closing Reorganization. Accordingly, Parent hereby agrees, following the
Effective Time, (a) to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate
the Post-Closing Reorganization within three Business Days of the Effective
Time and (b) to provide all Securityholder Beneficiaries with written notice
of such consummation within 10 days following such consummation (to the
address and contact person provided by the Company to Parent not less than
three Business Days prior to the Effective Time); provided that using
commercially reasonable efforts pursuant to this Section 5.14(a) shall not
require Parent to accept or agree to any Burdensome Condition or to use any
efforts beyond those stated in Section 5.06(a) and Section 5.07(b) with
respect to the matters described therein.

(b) In the event Parent is unable to consummate the Post-Closing
Reorganization within such three Business Day period, Parent agrees, to the
extent permissible under applicable



46 

Law and subject to receipt of the regulatory approvals specified in Section
4.03(b)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to issue to each Securityholder Beneficiary that requests
such, a "second-to-pay" financial guaranty insurance policy on terms that are
customary for similar policies previously issued by Parent pursuant to which
Parent would make payment to such Securityholder Beneficiary or to an
applicable custodian or insurance trustee, as reasonably determined by Parent,
in the event that both (i) the Insurance Subsidiary that issued the relevant
Secondary Market Insurance Contract fails to pay all amounts due under such
Secondary Market Insurance Contract in accordance with its terms and (ii) if
applicable, CIFG NA fails to pay all amounts due under any "second-to-pay"
insurance policy it has issued in respect of such Secondary Market Insurance
Contract in accordance with its terms, in each case, subject to and in
accordance with the terms of such Secondary Market Insurance Contract or CIFG
NA "second-to-pay" insurance policy; provided that using commercially
reasonable efforts pursuant to this Section 5.14(b) shall not require Parent
to qualify to transact business or obtain a license in any jurisdiction where
it is not presently qualified or licensed, register as a major swap
participant, major security-based swap participant, swap dealer, or security-
based swap dealer, or otherwise become subject to any scheme of regulation to
which it is not already subject.

(c) In the event of a failure of Parent to use commercially reasonable efforts
as provided in Section 5.14(a) or (b), such Securityholder Beneficiaries shall
have the right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 8.08 to cause
Parent to comply with such covenants in Section 5.14(a) or (b) but in no event
shall any Securityholder Beneficiary nor any of its Affiliates, or any other
Person, be entitled to, or make any claim for, any damages resulting from
Parent's failure to comply with Section 5.14(a) or (b).

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Written Consent:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company:



50 

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before October 12, 2016 (the
"Outside Date"), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result of
a breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;
provided, however, that if on such date any of the conditions precedent to the
Closing set forth in Section 6.01(c) or Section 6.01(d) have not been
satisfied but all other conditions precedent to the Closing have been
satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied on such date), then
any party, by notice to the other parties, may extend the Outside Date by up
to forty-five (45) days; or

(ii) if any condition to the obligation of such party to consummate the Merger
set forth in Section 6.01 (in the case of Parent or the Company), Section 6.02
(in the case of Parent) or Section 6.03 (in the case of the Company) becomes
incapable of satisfaction prior to the Outside Date; provided, however, that
such termination shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply
with or perform in any material respect any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement has been the primary cause of such
incapability to satisfy such condition;

(iii) if the Company shall not have provided Parent reasonably satisfactory
evidence of receipt of the Written Consent prior to the close of business
within 24 hours of execution and delivery of this Agreement.

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if any Law or final, non-appealable
Governmental Order shall have been enacted, issued, enforced or deemed
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger) that has the effect of making the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal;

(d) by Parent, if the Company materially breaches or fails to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.02, and (ii) cannot be cured
prior to the Outside Date (provided, that Parent is not then in material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement); or

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub materially breaches or fails to
perform in any material respect of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.03, and
(ii) cannot be cured prior to the Outside Date (provided, that the Company is
not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement); or

(f) by the Company, if (A) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing
within three (3) Business Days following the date the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.02, (B) the Company has confirmed in writing to
Parent that it is prepared to consummate the Closing, and (C) the Company has
and continues to be ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger.



51

Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect
(except as stated in Section 7.02(a) above) and there shall be no liability or
obligation under this Agreement on the part of any party to this Agreement or
their respective Representatives.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d),
(e) or (f) of Section 7.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of
no further force or effect (except as stated in Section 7.02(a) above);
provided that no party will be relieved or released of any liability or
damages arising out of any failure to comply with or breach of this Agreement
or fraud related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 8.01 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.
Except for Sections 5.04 (Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and
Insurance), 5.09 (Public Announcements), 5.11 (Employees and Benefits) and
this Article VIII, none of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this
Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of such
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, shall survive the
Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein and
therein that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part
after the Effective Time.

Section 8.02 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, before or after the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company and Merger Sub
only by an instrument making specific reference to this Agreement in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties; provided that, any amendment adopted
after the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or
Merger Sub shall not (1) alter or change the Per Share Amount of cash to be
received by Securityholders, (2) alter or change any term of the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as provided in Exhibit B or (3)

this Agreement may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation
or other act of any other party to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracy in
the representations and warranties of any other party contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (c)
waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any condition to its
own obligations contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound by such extension or waiver. The failure of a



52 

party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.04 Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given and

given upon receipt), sent by electronic transmission (including by fax)

Section 8.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 8.06 Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including all Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto) together with the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement (a) constitute the
entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties any rights or remedies; provided that Section
5.04 with respect to the Indemnified Persons described therein, Section 5.14
with respect to the Securityholder Beneficiaries described therein, Section
8.11 with respect to the counsel named therein, and Section 8.12 with respect
to Company Releasees and Securityholder Releasees, each of such third parties
referenced therein shall be express third party beneficiaries hereunder
entitled to enforce each such provision as if they were party hereto.
Notwithstanding subclause (b) in the foregoing sentence, (i) following the
Effective Time, the provisions of Article II and Section 5.13(b) shall also be
enforceable by Securityholders as express third party beneficiaries hereunder
who are entitled to enforce each such provision as if they were party hereto.

Section 8.07 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise (other than following the Closing by
operation of law pursuant to a merger) by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.08 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms of this Agreement, in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. Such equitable relief shall
be in addition to any other remedy to which the parties hereto are entitled to
at law or in equity as a remedy for such nonperformance, breach or threatened
breach. Each party hereby waives any requirements for the securing or posting
of any bond with such equitable remedy.

Section 8.09 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that state. All actions and proceedings
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall



54 

be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware. The
parties to this Agreement hereby (a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the above-named court, for the purpose of any Action arising
in whole or in part out of, relating to, based upon or in connection with this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof brought by any party to this Agreement,
(b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be
enforced in or by any of the above-named court, and (c) agrees not to commence
any such action other than before one of the above-named court nor to make any
motion or take any other action seeking or intending to cause the transfer or
removal of any Action to any court other than the above-named court whether on
the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise.

Section 8.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) certifies that no
Representative or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek
to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other
parties to this Agreement have been induced to enter into this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as applicable, by, among
other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 8.10.

Section 8.11 Legal Representation. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and
Feld LLP may serve as counsel to each and any former or current holder of
Company Shares (other than CIFG NA) or to any of their respective affiliates,
officers, directors or employees (collectively, with each such holder of
Company Shares, the "Securityholder Group"), on the one hand, and the Company
and the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
following Closing, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP may serve as counsel to
any member of the Securityholder Group or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or affiliate of the Securityholder Group, in each case in
their capacity as such, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each of the parties to this Agreement consents to such
representation and waives any conflict of interest arising from such
representation, and each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate to consent
to waive any conflict of interest arising from such representation. In
connection with any dispute that may arise between the Securityholder Group
and Parent or the Surviving Corporation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the individual
members of the Securityholder Group involved in such dispute (and not Parent
or the Surviving Corporation) will have the right to decide whether or not to
waive any attorney client privilege that may apply to any communications
between the Company and Akin



55 

Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP that occurred before the Closing; provided, that
any such waived information may only be used in connection with such dispute.

Section 8.12 Releases.

(a) No Securityholder Releasee shall have any personal liability or personal
obligation to any Securityholder or its Affiliates of any nature whatsoever in
connection with or under this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply to the obligations of Parent to pay to the Paying Agent the
Consideration pursuant to the terms hereof or any other express obligations of
Parent pursuant to this Agreement. No Company Releasee shall have any personal
liability or personal obligation to Parent or Merger Sub of any nature
whatsoever in connection with or under this Agreement. Effective upon the
Effective Time, each of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, on
behalf of itself and its respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges each Company
Releasee from any and all past, present and future actions, claims, causes of
action, debts, obligations, liabilities, damages or losses of any kind,
character, description or nature whatsoever, known or unknown to any of
Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, suspected or unsuspected,
reported or unreported, fixed or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, liquidated
or unliquidated, whether grounded in law or equity or sounding in tort or
contract or otherwise, which any of Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, now has,
owns or holds or claims to have, own or hold, or at any time heretofore had,
owned or held or claimed to have had, owned or held, or may hereafter have,
own or hold or claim to have, own or hold, arising directly or indirectly out
of, based upon, or in any way related to or in connection with any conduct
prior to the Effective Time of such Company Releasee in connection with the
Company's businesses or transactions; provided, however, that the provisions
of this Section 8.12 shall not discharge (a) any rights or obligations of a
Company Releasee under any Affiliated Agreements (whether or not listed in
Section 3.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) or any other Contracts
with any Company Releasee or (b) any rights of any Indemnified Person under
any organizational documents of, or Contracts with, the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries relating to indemnification or advancement of
expenses or any rights as third party beneficiary under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.12(a), the releases
granted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation to
any Company Releasee hereunder shall be conditioned on, and only be effective
following, the Company's receipt of a release granted by the Securityholder
(relating to such Company Releasee) as contemplated by Section 8.12(b).

(b) Effective upon the Effective Time, each Securityholder, on behalf of
itself and its respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever discharges each
Securityholder Releasee from any and all past, present and future actions,
claims, causes of action, debts, obligations, liabilities, damages or losses
of any kind, character, description or nature whatsoever, known or unknown to
any Securityholder or its Affiliates, suspected or unsuspected, reported or
unreported, fixed or contingent, accrued or unaccrued, liquidated or
unliquidated, whether grounded in law or equity or sounding in tort or
contract or otherwise, which any Securityholder, or its Affiliates, successors
and assigns, now has, owns or holds or claims to have, own or hold, or at any
time heretofore had, owned or held or



56 

claimed to have had, owned or held, or may hereafter have, own or hold or
claim to have, own or hold, arising directly or indirectly out of, based upon,
or in any way related to or in connection with any conduct prior to the
Effective Time of such Securityholder Releasee in connection with the
ownership of the Company or the Company's businesses or transactions;
provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.12 shall not
discharge (a) any rights or obligations of a Securityholder Releasee under any
Affiliated Agreements or any other Contracts with any Securityholder Releasee
or (b) any rights of the Securityholders under this Agreement or the Paying
Agent Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the releases described in this
Section 8.12(b) shall be effected by including in each Letter of Transmittal
delivered by a Securityholder to the Company, such Securityholder's
acknowledgement of and agreement with the release set forth in this Section
8.12(b), and the parties hereto agree to cause each Letter of Transmittal to
include language to that effect.

Section 8.13 Parent and Merger Sub Acknowledgement.

(a) Parent is knowledgeable about the business engaged in by the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries and about the usual and customary practices of
companies engaged in businesses similar to such business. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that the representations and warranties set forth in
Article III constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties
of the Company to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and there are no other representations,
warranties, covenants, understandings or agreements between the parties, oral
or written, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, Parent and
Merger Sub disclaim reliance on any representations or warranties, either
express or implied, by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or their affiliates or representatives. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
none of the Company, officers of the Company, directors of the Company or any
other Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as
to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company and
the Transferred Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Merger Sub and its
Representatives, including any pro forma financial information, financial
projections, other forward-looking statements or any other material made
available to Parent or Merger Sub in any "data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that the Company makes no express or implied
representation or warranty hereby or otherwise under this Agreement as to the
future experience, success or profitability of the Company's and the
Transferred Subsidiaries' businesses, whether or not conducted in a manner
similar to the manner in which such businesses were conducted prior to the
Closing, that the reserves held by or on behalf of the Company or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or the assets supporting such reserves have been or
will be adequate or sufficient for the purposes for which they were
established, that the reinsurance recoverables taken into account in
determining the amount of such reserves will be collectible or whether such
reserves were calculated, established or determined in accordance with any
actuarial, statutory or other standard, or concerning any financial statement
"line item" or asset, liability or equity amount that would be affected by any
of the foregoing.



57
