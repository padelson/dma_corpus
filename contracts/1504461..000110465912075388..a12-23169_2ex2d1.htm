and Buyer shall purchase from each Seller (on a several and not joint and

_Purchase Price_ ") for the Equity is One Hundred, Twenty Five Million Dollars
($125,000,000.00), payable in cash and subject to adjustment as provided

 **Section 2.3** ** ****Calculation and Payment of the Purchase Price; Agreed
Adjustments**.

 



 

(a) At Closing, Buyer shall pay to each Seller an amount of cash equal to the
Closing Payment multiplied by the Percentage Interest applicable to such
Seller. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Closing Payment_ " shall mean
an aggregate amount of cash equal to (i) the Purchase Price, (ii) _minus_ the

(b) Upon the Closing, Buyer shall withhold an amount of cash equal to Seven

purpose). The Escrow Amount, together with all interest and earnings thereon

provisions of the Escrow Agreement. On January 1, 2014 (the " _Initial Release
Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Account as directed by the
Sellers Representative (and the Escrow Agent is hereby entitled to rely on
such direction); _provided, however_ , in the event that Buyer has then timely
and properly submitted claims against such Escrow Account (each an " _Escrow
Claim_ ") to the Sellers Representative, the parties hereto agree that the
Escrow Account (or such portion of the Escrow Account as shall be encumbered
by timely and properly submitted Escrow Claims) shall be maintained by the
Escrow Agent until, at the latest, April 30, 2014. On May 1, 2014 (the "
_Final Release Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall deliver any remaining funds in
the Escrow Account, whether or not an Escrow Claim has been made or remains
unresolved, as directed by the Sellers Representative (and the Escrow Agent is
hereby entitled to rely on such direction). Following Closing, but prior to
release of the funds in the Escrow Account on the Initial Release Date or the
Final Release Date, as the case may be and as contemplated above, Buyer and
the Sellers Representative agree to (i) promptly and in good faith attempt to
resolve any Escrow Claims submitted by Buyer against the Escrow Account and
(ii) provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release funds
in the Escrow Account to Buyer where Buyer has made a proper and timely claim
therefor and the amount of such claim has been finally determined by the
parties pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. Buyer agrees to promptly
(and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days) acknowledge and confirm,
in writing, any advice or

 



      
 

 



 

instruction provided to the Escrow Agent by the Sellers Representative in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.3(b)_ if requested by the Escrow
Agent or the Sellers Representative (including advice on or following the
Initial Release Date or the Final Release Date that funds must be released as
directed by the Sellers Representative). For purposes of clarity, subject to
the limitations set forth in _Article VII_, if an Escrow Claim is not
resolved prior to the Final Release Date and funds have been released at the
instruction of the Seller Representative with respect thereto, a Buyers
Indemnified Person may seek payment directly from the Sellers for the amount
of such Escrow Claim.

 



 

(c) All parties hereto agree, for all Tax purposes, that: (i) Buyer shall be
treated as the owner of the Escrow Account, and the Escrow Account, or any
portion thereof, shall be allocable to Buyer pursuant to Section 468B(g) of
the Code and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8, (ii) if and to the
extent any amount of the Escrow Account is actually distributed to Sellers,
interest may be imputed on such amount, as required by Section 483 or 1274 of
the Code, (iii) Sellers rights to the Escrow Account under this Agreement
shall be treated as installment obligations for purposes of Section 453 of the
Code, and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate payments under the Escrow
Account to Sellers exceed Seven Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars
($7,800,000). _Clause (iv)_ of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure
that the right of Sellers to the Escrow Account is not treated as a contingent
payment without a stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. No party hereto shall
take any action or filing position inconsistent with the foregoing.

 



 

(d) At Closing, Buyer shall increase the Purchase Price, on a dollar for
dollar basis, for the cash portion of those capital expenditures actually
incurred by the Pecos Entities between the date hereof and the Closing Date if
(i) such capital expenditures are set forth on the Capital Expansion Budget
attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto (the " _Capital Expansion Budget_ "), (ii) if
not set forth on the Capital Expansion Budget, such amounts do not exceed
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (in the aggregate) or (iii) Buyer has
otherwise agreed in writing to reimburse Sellers for such capital expenditures
(the " _Reimbursable Capital Expenditures_ "). Accordingly, the parties agree
to report any Reimbursable Capital Expenditures paid pursuant to this _Section
2.3(d)_ as an adjustment (i.e., increase) to the Purchase Price and,
furthermore, each party agrees not to initiate any Tax filing or Tax-related
Legal Proceeding in which such party takes a position inconsistent with the
position expressed herein.

 



 

(e) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Pecos
Entities shall deliver to Buyer (a) an estimated consolidated unaudited
balance sheet for the Pecos Entities prepared in accordance with GAAP which
balance sheet shall reflect the estimated balances as of the Closing Date (but
without giving effect to the Closing) (the " _Estimated Balance Sheet_ "), and
(b) an itemized good faith estimate of Working Capital for the Pecos Entities
as of the Closing Date (including the balances of each line item included
within the definition of Working Capital) (but without giving effect to the
Closing) (" _Estimated Working Capital_ ").

 



 

(f) At Closing, in order to establish a fund to, among other things, pay the
costs and expenses of the Sellers Representative and the Sellers after the
Closing (including any

 



      
 

 



 

and all costs and expenses arising from any dispute or disagreement involving
this Agreement or Buyer), Buyer shall remit to the Escrow Agent (or such other
Person as shall be designated by the Sellers Representative), to be deposited
into an account separate and apart from the Escrow Account (the " _Expense
Account_ "), an amount equal to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the
" _Expense Reserve Amount_ ") to be held by the Escrow Agent (or such other
designated Person) for the exclusive benefit of the Sellers Representative and
Sellers pursuant to the terms of the Expense Agreement. Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that it shall have no interest whatsoever (now or in the future)
in the Expense Account (which has _not_ been set aside as security for the
Sellers or the Pecos Entities obligations to Buyer hereunder) and the Escrow
Agent (or such other designated Person) shall take instruction in connection
therewith exclusively from the Sellers Representative. Once deposited with the
Escrow Agent (or such other designated Person), Buyer disclaims any and all
right, title or interest in, to or under the Expense Account or the underlying
Expense Reserve Amount. For income tax reporting matters, the Sellers shall be
regarded as the owners of the Expense Reserve Amount.

 



 

(g) At Closing, Buyer shall issue the NGL Restricted Units to Dolloff on the
conditions and pursuant to the terms contained in the Restricted Unit Grant
Agreement. At Closing, Buyer shall pay the Stay Bonus Amount directly to Pecos
**** in order to permit it to fund its obligations under that Closing Date
Compensation Letters. Pecos agrees to fund the Stay Bonus Amount contemplated
by the Closing Date Compensation Letters on the Closing Date, if (but only if)

(h) By execution hereof, each of the Sellers hereby expressly acknowledges and
agrees (i) that he, she or it understands the purchase price mechanics set
forth herein (including the manner in which his, her or its Percentage
Interest will be calculated) and (ii) to the deduction from the Purchase Price
for the items referenced herein, including the establishment of the Escrow
Account and the Expense Account, the retention of the funds for such accounts
and the distribution and use of those funds pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Expense Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 2.4** ** ****Final Working Capital Determination**.

 



 

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) and deliver to the Sellers Representative (i) the
proposed final unaudited **** consolidated balance sheet of the Pecos Entities
as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP (but without giving
effect to the Closing) (the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) an
itemized schedule of proposed Working Capital as of the Closing Date
(including the balances of each line item included within the definition of
Working Capital) (but without giving effect to the Closing) (the " _Closing
Date Working Capital_ ") and (iii) an itemized schedule of differences between
the line items reflected in Buyers Closing Date Working Capital calculation
and the line items reflected in the Pecos Entities Estimated Working Capital
calculation (and a reasonably detailed analysis of the basis, reason or
rationale for the proposed change as well as supporting references to GAAP,
this Agreement or _Exhibit D_, as the case may be) (the " _Schedule of
Differences_ "). Each of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the schedule of
Closing Date Working Capital and Schedule of Differences (together, the "
_Final Determination Documents_ ") shall be prepared by Buyer in good faith in
accordance with this Agreement (including the

 



      
 

 



 

definition of Working Capital contained herein) and in accordance with GAAP
(but without giving effect to the Closing). Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer agrees that it shall not, nor shall it cause or permit
its Representatives to, apply or use (or attempt to apply or use) accounting
practices, policies, judgments or methodologies different from or inconsistent
with those applied and used by the Pecos Entities historically unless such
practices, policies, judgments or methodologies are inconsistent with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Following delivery of the
Final Determination Documents, the Sellers Representative and his
Representatives, upon reasonable advance notice to Buyer, shall have the right
to visit the Pecos Entities during normal business hours to verify and review
such Final Determination Documents and the books, records and accounting
information of the Pecos Entities relating thereto (including accountants
work papers, if any). Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond (and to cause its Representatives, including accountants, to respond)
to reasonable inquiries from the Sellers Representative and his
Representatives related to such verification and review. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide access to the necessary books and records of the Pecos
Entities electronically. If Buyer fails to deliver the Final Determination
Documents within the period described, the Estimated Working Capital proposed
by the Pecos Entities prior to Closing shall be deemed, for all purposes
hereunder, to be (and shall be conclusively regarded as) the Final Working
Capital.

 



 

(b) If, within forty-five (45) days following delivery of the Final
Determination Documents to the Sellers Representative, the Sellers
Representative has not delivered to Buyer written notice (the " _Objection
Notice_ ") of his objections to the schedule of Closing Date Working Capital,
then Closing Date Working Capital, as set forth in such schedule, shall be
deemed final and conclusive and shall be Final Working Capital; _provided,
however_ , the response period for the Objection Notice shall be increased to
sixty (60) days in the event that the Closing Date Working Capital proposed by
Buyer would, if accepted, result in an additional payment to the Buyer under
the terms hereof of more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). If the
Sellers Representative delivers the Objection Notice within such prescribed
period, then Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall endeavor in good faith
to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed forty-five (45) days
from the date of delivery of the Objection Notice. In the event that Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall resolve all objections set forth in the
Objection Notice within such forty-five (45) day period, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall execute a memorandum setting forth (i) the resolved
item(s) and/or amount(s) and (ii) Final Working Capital, as calculated based
on such resolved item(s) and/or amount(s). If, however, at the end of the
forty-five (45) day period there are any objections that remain in dispute,
then the remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted to an independent
accounting firm (the " _Independent Auditor_ "), mutually agreeable to Buyer
and the Sellers Representative, which firm shall resolve any objections that
remain in dispute. Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to select the Independent Auditor within ten
(10) days of the expiration of such period and to cause the Independent
Auditor to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable following
appointment. The parties agree that (A) any Person proposed as an Independent
Auditor must disclose, in writing to Buyer and the Sellers Representative, any
factors, relationships, current or prior engagements or similar matters that
could reasonably be regarded as a conflict hereunder or which would,
reasonably or in the opinion of the Independent Auditor, cause it to have or
maintain (or potentially have or

 



      
 

 



 

maintain) a bias for or against either party, (B) the Independent Auditor
shall be retained jointly by Buyer and the Sellers Representative, (C) the
Independent Auditor shall be instructed by both the Sellers Representative and
Buyer, in writing within two (2) Business Days of its engagement, that it must
remain neutral with respect to the dispute, (D) the Independent Auditor must
make a final determination in accordance with a strict interpretation of the
relevant provisions of this Agreement, (E) each of Buyer and the Sellers
Representative will provide the Independent Auditor with such access to books,
records and accounting information (including accountants work papers) as the
Independent Auditor regards as reasonably related or necessary to its
assignment hereunder, (F) it will not engage, nor permit any of its
Representatives to engage, in any ex parte communications with the Independent
Auditor (it being the agreement between the parties that all communications
between the Independent Auditor and any party shall be in writing, with a copy
of the original communication, any response thereto and any other
communication, to be delivered to the other party) and (G) the Independent
Auditor will be required to provide a written report with respect to its
determination hereunder. The scope of the Independent Auditors engagement
shall be limited to the resolution of the unresolved disputed items described
in the Objection Notice, and the recalculation, if any, of the amounts therein
in light of such resolution. The determination by the Independent Auditor
shall be binding on the parties and shall represent Final Working Capital,
absent manifest error or a failure to adhere to the express terms of this
Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor incurred in
connection with the resolution of a dispute pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_
shall be borne equally by the Sellers (on the one hand) and Buyer (on the
other hand). Each party shall bear its own attorneys fees associated with a
dispute pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_.

both Final Working Capital and Estimated Working Capital are greater than the
Maximum Working Capital Target, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer, as instructed

foreign entity in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or
the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure so

For each of the Pecos Entities, a true, correct and complete copy of its (i)
Articles of Formation and (ii) Operating Agreement or Limited Liability
Company Agreement, as the case may be, (such governing documents for the Pecos
Entities, together, the " _Constituent Documents_ "), as in effect on the date

date of this Agreement, the Sellers own and as of the Closing Date, the
Sellers will own, one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding
Equity of the Pecos Entities. All of the issued and outstanding Equity

 



      
 

 



 

of the Pecos Entities were issued in material compliance with Applicable Laws
concerning the issuance of securities. No bonds, debentures, notes or other
instruments or evidence of Indebtedness having the right to vote (or

them is bound, in any case obligating one or more of the Pecos Entities to
issue, deliver, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, equity or voting securities
of one or more of the Pecos Entities, or obligating the Pecos Entities to
grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment
or agreement.

 



 

 **Section 3.3** ** ****Ownership of Equity**. Each Seller owns, legally,
beneficially (subject to the community property interests of the Sellers
spouses, if any) and of record all of the Equity listed opposite such Sellers
name on _Disclosure Schedule 3.3_ , free and clear of any and all Liens, other

enforceable against the Sellers and/or the Pecos Entities in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions, except that the enforcement hereof and
thereof may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or

principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

 **Section 3.7** ** ****No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents**. The

 **ARTICLE IV.**

 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER**

 



 

Buyer represents and warrants to Sellers and the Pecos Entities as follows:

 



 

 **Section 4.1** ** ****Good Standing and Other Matters**. Buyer is validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware U.S.A.
and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. A true,
correct and complete copy of Buyers partnership agreement, in effect on the
date of this Agreement, has been delivered to Sellers.

 



 

 **Section 4.2** ** ****Authority**. Buyer has the requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and to consummate the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated herein and therein. The execution and delivery by Buyer of this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Buyer. This
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer is or
will be a party has been, or upon execution and delivery thereof will be, duly
and validly executed and delivered by Buyer and, assuming that this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party constitute the
valid and binding agreement of the other parties hereto and thereto,
constitute, or upon execution and delivery will constitute, the valid and
binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with
their respective terms and conditions, except that the enforcement hereof and
thereof may be limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights generally and (b) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).

 



 

 **Section 4.3** ** ****No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents**. The
execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not, and the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not, (a)
violate or result in any breach of any provision of the partnership agreement
of Buyer; (b) materially violate or result in a material violation or material
breach of, or constitute a material default (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any material contract of Buyer or any other material agreement to which Buyer
is a party; (c) materially violate any Applicable Law binding upon Buyer or by
which or to which a material portion of Buyers assets is bound; or (d) result
in the imposition or creation of any Lien on any asset of Buyer. No Consent of
any Governmental Authority is required by Buyer in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the consummation by Buyer of
the transactions contemplated herein or therein.

 



 

 **Section 4.4** ** ****Compliance with Applicable Laws**. Buyer has, during
the two (2) year period prior to this Agreement (i) complied with all
Applicable Laws, except to the extent the failure to so comply would not be
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, and (ii) held all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of
all Governmental Authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of its business,
except to the extent failure to hold such items would not be reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect. The Buyer is, as of the date of this
Agreement, in material compliance with all material permits. As of the date of
this Agreement, no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority that
is material to the Buyer is pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened.

 



 

 **Section 4.5** ** ****Absence of Litigation**. As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no material Legal Proceeding by or before any court,
arbitrator or other Governmental Authority, nor are there any reviews or
investigations material to the Buyer pending or, to the knowledge of the
Buyer, threatened against or involving the Buyer or any of the material assets
owned or used by the Buyer.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 4.6** ** ****Taxes**.

 



 

(a) For federal income Tax purposes (and to the extent applicable for state
Tax purposes as well), Buyer is treated as a partnership.

 



 

(b) Not more than ten percent (10%) of Buyers gross income for the taxable
year of Buyer during which the Closing occurs, and the following taxable year
of Buyer, shall fail to constitute "qualifying income" within the meaning of
Code Section 7704(d), except in the case of a merger or acquisition of Buyer
or a material change in the regulatory or Tax environment.

 



 

 **Section 4.7** ** ****Sufficiency of Funds**. Buyer has sufficient cash on
hand or other sources of immediately available funds to enable it to make
payment of the Purchase Price and consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyers willingness to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned, implicitly or otherwise, on
financing not yet obtained.

 



 

 **Section 4.8** ** ****Solvency**. As of the Closing and immediately after
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer will (i)
not be insolvent (either because its financial condition is such that the sum
of its debts (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities) is
greater than the fair value of its assets or because the present fair salable
value of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its debts (including the probable amount of all contingent
liabilities) as they become absolute and matured), (ii) not have unreasonably
small capital with which to engage in its business as presently conducted or
as intended by Buyer to be conducted, or (iii) not have incurred or plan to
incur debts (including amounts payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and the probable amount of all contingent liabilities)
beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and matured.

 



 

 **Section 4.9** ** ****Broker s Commissions**. Buyer has not, directly or
indirectly, entered into any agreement with any Person that would obligate
Buyer, the Pecos Entities or any Seller thereof to pay any commission,
brokerage fee or "finders fee" in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.

 



 

 **Section 4.10** ** ****Buyer s Key Managers**. Buyers Key Managers are
the officers of Buyer who have been principally responsible for receiving,
evaluating, considering and passing upon all of the due diligence information
made available by the Sellers and the Pecos Entities, including by way of the
Data Room.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V.**

 

 **COVENANTS**

 



 

 **Section 5.1** ** ****Public Announcements; Confidentiality**.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law (based upon the reasonable
advice of counsel which such advice shall be confirmed in writing if
requested), no party to this Agreement shall make, or allow its
Representatives to make, any announcements (whether now or at any time in the
future) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or otherwise communicate with any news media or other private or public source

 



      
 

 



 

(including as background or if the source shall otherwise agree to retain the
information as confidential) without the prior written consent of (i) the
Pecos Entities and the Sellers Representative if the request is made by Buyer
prior to Closing, (ii) the Sellers Representative if the request is made by
Buyer or the Pecos Entities after the Closing or (iii) Buyer if the request is
made by the Pecos Entities, the Sellers Representative or any Seller prior to
the Closing or by the Sellers Representative or any Seller after the Closing.
In no event shall any party be liable or responsible for the content of any
press release or other public statement issued by another party. The parties
shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement.

 



 

(b) The parties acknowledge that certain information received pursuant to the
negotiations leading to execution of this Agreement are non-public and/or
proprietary in nature and, as such, will be deemed to be "Confidential
Information" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement. Each party further
confirms and ratifies the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement and hereby agrees to maintain the confidentiality of such
Confidential Information, and to refrain from using the Confidential
Information, in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer acknowledges and agrees to keep confidential,
in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
information contained in this Agreement (or any drafts hereof) as well as all
negotiations and discussions related hereto. For purposes of absolute clarity,
the parties acknowledge that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated
prior to Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and this _Section 5.1_ shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect.

 



 

 **Section 5.2** ** ****Access**.

 



 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date (or sooner
termination or expiration hereof) and upon reasonable notice, each party shall
afford the officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
Representatives of the requesting party reasonable access, during normal
business hours, to such disclosing partys properties, books, contracts and
records as well as to its management personnel; _provided_ that such access
shall be provided on a basis that minimizes the disruption to the operations
of the disclosing party; _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall not (nor
permit its Representatives to) (i) contact, either directly or indirectly, any
employees, independent contractors, customers, prospects, vendors, suppliers
or other business relationships of the Pecos Entities (collectively, the "
_Key Relationships_ ") or (ii) perform invasive or subsurface investigations
of the Real Property, without in either situation, the prior written consent
of the Seller Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Sellers and the Pecos Entities shall have a right
to have a Representative present at all times of any inspections, interviews
and examinations conducted at or in its offices or other facilities or
properties or in connection with any interviews of the Key Relationships.

 



 

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the disclosing party
shall not be responsible or liable to the requesting party for injuries
sustained by the requesting partys officers, employees, counsel, accountants
and other authorized Representatives in connection with the access provided
pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_, and such disclosing party shall be indemnified,
defended and held harmless by the requesting party for any and all Losses
suffered by the disclosing party or its officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other

 



      
 

 



 

authorized Representatives in connection with any such injuries, including
personal injury, death or physical property damage. THIS INDEMNIFICATION IS
EXPRESSLY INTENDED TO APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE,
CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE) OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY ON THE PART
OF THE DISCLOSING PARTY, EXCEPTING ONLY INJURIES ACTUALLY RESULTING ON THE
ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE DISCLOSING PARTY.

 



 

 **Section 5.3** ** ****Supplement to Disclosure Schedules**.

 



 

(a) From time to time before the Closing Date, the Pecos Entities and the
Sellers shall promptly (but, in any event, within three (3) Business Days)
supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules (and the information and
materials provided in connection therewith) to disclose any fact, condition,
matter, thing, development or occurrence (i) that has taken place after the
date hereof and (ii) that would cause or constitute a breach of any
representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ had such representation
or warranty been made as of the time of discovery of such fact, condition,
matter, thing, development or occurrence. No disclosure set forth in a
supplement or amendment to the Disclosure Schedules as contemplated hereby
shall, except as contemplated in _Section 5.3(b)_, (a) be deemed to have been
disclosed for purposes of determining whether any of the conditions to Closing
in _Article VI_ have been fulfilled or (b) affect the Buyer Indemnified
Persons right to indemnification or other remedies provided for in this
Agreement with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty.

 



 

(b) If (i) the matter or matters included in any such disclosure supplement
individually or in the aggregate constitute a Material Adverse Effect, and
(ii) the Sellers Representative delivers to Buyer an explicit written
acknowledgment of Buyers right to terminate this Agreement (given the
condition specified in _Section 6.2(c)_ and Buyers termination rights in
connection therewith), and thereafter Buyer does not terminate this Agreement
within ten (10) calendar days of the delivery of such authorization (or 9.00
a.m. (central time) on the Closing Date if sooner), then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement as a result of, or seek indemnification hereunder in
respect of, such matter or matters included in such disclosure supplement. For
purposes of adding additional clarity hereto, the parties acknowledge that the
Sellers Representative shall not have any obligation (but only a right) to
provide an explicit written acknowledgment of termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

 



 

(c) If following delivery of the acknowledgment contemplated by _Section
5.3(b)(ii)_ above, Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement within the period
prescribed, Buyer shall have no further rights or remedies in connection
therewith (including indemnification under _Article VII_ hereof); it being
the intention of the parties that termination by Buyer under those
circumstances will function as its exclusive election of remedies in
connection therewith.

 



 

 **Section 5.4** ** ****Employees; Benefit Plans**.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the date which
is twelve (12) months from the Closing (or if earlier, the date of the
employees

 



      
 

 



 

termination of employment with the Pecos Entities), Buyer shall and shall
cause the Pecos Entities to provide employees who remain employed immediately
after the Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ " and each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") with (i) base salary or hourly wages which are no less than the
base salary or hourly wages provided by the Pecos Entities immediately prior
to the Closing and (ii) retirement and welfare benefits that are not
materially less favorable (when considered in the aggregate) than those
provided by the Pecos Entities immediately prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding this _Section 5.4_, the Continuing Employees will be employed
at will and Buyer shall retain the right to terminate employees for
nonperformance and other reasons according to its (and the Pecos Entities)
standard business practices.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to allow the
Continuing Employees to participate in any employee benefit plan maintained by
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ "), in
each case, to the extent consistent with and permitted by the terms of such
Buyer Benefit Plans. With respect to the Buyer Benefit Plans in which any
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Pecos Entities or the relevant Affiliate to,
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with the Pecos Entities as
if such service were with Buyer or the relevant Affiliate, for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes) in any Buyer
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Closing.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth
in this _Section 5.4_ shall not create any right in any Continuing Employee
or any other Person to any continued employment with the Pecos Entities, Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates for any amount of time.

 



 

 **Section 5.5** ** ****Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs**. Buyer shall not,
and shall cause the Pecos Entities to not, take any action within one year
following the Closing that could result in WARN Act liability. Buyer hereby
agrees to indemnify, and hold the Sellers harmless from, any and all cost,
expenses, liabilities or Losses incurred under the WARN Act following the
Closing.

 



 

 **Section 5.6** ** ****Director and Officer Indemnification**.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Pecos Entities now existing in favor of each Person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior
to the Closing Date, an officer or director (or similar capacity) of one or
more of the Pecos Entities, as provided in the Constituent Documents, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date hereof, shall survive the Closing Date and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms.

 



 

(b) The obligations of Buyer and the Pecos Entities under this _Section 5.6_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any director or officer (or similar capacity) to whom this _Section 5.6_
applies without the consent of such affected

 



      
 

 



 

Person (it being expressly agreed that the Person to whom this _Section 5.6_
applies shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.6_).

 



 

(c) In the event Buyer, the Pecos Entities or any of their respective
successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Pecos Entities, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.6_.

 



 

 **Section 5.7** ** ****Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party
Consents**

 



 

(a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all Consents from all
Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its
Representatives in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents. The parties
hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect of
delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required Consents from
Governmental Authorities.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Buyers undertaking pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid
or eliminate every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other
party as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets,
properties or business or the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired
by it pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to defend through litigation
on the merits or otherwise resolve short of litigation (but, in each case, at
Buyers sole cost and expense) any claim asserted in court by any party in
order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental
Order that would prevent or delay the Closing.

 



 

(c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments and proposals made by or on behalf of
either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of
any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions
between the Sellers or the Pecos Entities with Governmental Authorities in the
ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by
Applicable Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be
disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or
attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,

 



      
 

 



 

presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each
party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting,
discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff
or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient
to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact.

 



 

(d) The Pecos Entities and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give all notices to, and obtain all Consents from, all third parties that are
described in _Disclosure Schedule 3.7_; _provided, however_ , that the Pecos
Entities shall not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third
party from whom consent or approval is requested.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** ** ****Novations; Credit Facilities**.

 



 

(a) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate and/or
replace the Credit Enhancements set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.10_ prior
to the Closing. To the extent that any such Credit Enhancement remains
outstanding after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify any Credit Enhancer
from any losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by such Credit
Enhancer in the event the beneficiary of such Credit Enhancement requires any
payment, or the Credit Enhancer otherwise suffers any loss, liability, cost or
expense in connection therewith (it being expressly agreed that the Persons to
whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be intended third-party beneficiaries
of this _Section 5.8_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section 5.8_).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof, the parties agree
that, prior to Closing, the Pecos Entities shall be permitted to terminate all
Credit Enhancements previously in place for the benefit of the Pecos Entities,
including, without limitation, those relating to financing or credit
facilities that survive Closing.

 



 

 **Section 5.9** ** ****Tax Matters**.

 



 

(a) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the parties hereto agree to treat
the purchase of the membership interests of each of Black Hawk, Midstream,
Pecos, Striker and TransWest by Buyer as a purchase by Buyer of all of the
assets of each of Black Hawk, Midstream, Pecos, Striker and TransWest and the
sale of the membership interests of each of Black Hawk, Midstream, Pecos,
Striker and TransWest by the Sellers as a sale by the Sellers of all of the
membership interests of each of Black Hawk, Midstream, Pecos, Striker and
TransWest, as provided in Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2).

 



 

(b) The Sellers Representative will have the exclusive authority to prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of
the Pecos Entities for all Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date. Such Short Year Tax
Returns will be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Pecos Entities with respect to such
items, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. The Sellers Representative
will provide to Buyer a draft of the Tax Returns of the Pecos Entities
required to be prepared and filed by the Sellers Representative under this
_Section 5.9(b)_ at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return (including any extensions) for its review. At least
twenty (20) days

 



       
 

 



 

prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including any
extensions), Buyer will notify the Sellers Representative of the existence of
any objection (specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such
objection) Buyer may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Return.
Buyer and the Sellers Representative agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any such objection. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any
objections within ten (10) days following the delivery of written notice by
Buyer of such objections, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall jointly
request an independent accounting firm to resolve any issue in dispute at
least seven (7) days before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that
such Tax Return may be timely filed. Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall instruct the accountant to make its determination based solely on
presentations by Buyer and the Sellers Representative (i.e., not on the basis
of an independent review; _provided_ , _however_ , the accountant shall be
required to take into account matters of Applicable Law). The accountants
determination shall be final and binding on the parties effective on the date
the accountant delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and the
Sellers Representative, and all fees and expenses of the accountant for such
determination shall be allocated between Buyer and the Sellers so as to
approximate the extent to which the parties submitted differences were, on a
net basis, different from the amount finally resolved by the accountant (as an
illustration, this sentence would result in apportionment between both parties
equally if the amounts that each assigned to items in dispute were equidistant
from the amount finally resolved by the accountant). Subject to the foregoing,
the Sellers shall bear all costs and expenses relating to the preparation and
filing of Tax Returns under this _Section 5.9(b)_.

 



 

(c) Buyer will have the exclusive authority to prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns of the Pecos
Entities (except as provided in _Section 5.9(b)_ ). For Tax Returns for the
Straddle Period, such Tax Returns will be prepared by treating items on such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Pecos
Entities with respect to such items, unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law. For Tax Returns for the Straddle Period, Buyer will provide to the
Sellers Representative a draft of such Tax Returns required to be prepared and
filed by Buyer under this _Section 5.9(c)_ at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns (including any extensions). At
least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax
Returns (including any extensions), the Sellers Representative will notify
Buyer of the existence of any objection (specifying in reasonable detail the
nature and basis of such objection) the Sellers Representative may have to any
items set forth on such draft Tax Return. Buyer and the Sellers Representative
agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. In the event
the parties are unable to resolve any objections within ten (10) days
following the delivery of written notice by the Sellers Representative of such
objections, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall jointly request an
independent accounting firm to resolve any issue in dispute at least seven (7)
days before the due date of such Tax Returns, in order that such Tax Returns
may be timely filed. Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall instruct the
accountant to make its determination based solely on presentations by Buyer
and the Sellers Representative (i.e., not on the basis of an independent
review; _provided_ , _however_ , the accountant shall be required to take into
account matters of Applicable Law). The accountants determination shall be
final and binding on the parties effective on the date the accountant delivers
its final resolution in writing to Buyer and the Sellers Representative. The
accountant shall apportion its fees and expenses for such determination
between Buyer and the Sellers so as to approximate the extent to which the
parties

 



      
 

 



 

submitted differences were, on a net basis, different from the amount finally
resolved by the accountant (as an illustration, this sentence would result in
apportionment between both parties equally if the amounts that each assigned
to items in dispute were equidistant from the amount finally resolved by the
accountant). Subject to the foregoing, Buyer shall bear all costs and expenses
relating to the preparation and filing of Tax Returns under this _Section
5.9(c)_.

 



 

(d) For purposes of _Sections 5.9(b)_ and _5.9(c)_ , in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (the " _Straddle Period_ "),
the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income,
gains or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or employment or payroll
Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax
based upon or related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use
Tax), or employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to the Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in a manner consistent with the
apportionment of the Taxes subject to clause (i) above. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with reasonable prior practice of the Pecos Entities.

 



 

(e) Subject to the other provisions hereof, including the provisions of
_Article VII_, **** after the Closing, the Sellers shall, indemnify Buyer and
hold it harmless from and against: (i) all Taxes of the Pecos Entities for all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (ii) with respect to any Straddle Period, all Taxes
of the Pecos Entities attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period that
ends on and includes the Closing Date, (iii) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which one or more of
the Pecos Entities (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
non-U.S. law, rule or regulation, and (iv) any and all Taxes of any person
(other than the Pecos Entities) imposed on any of the Pecos Entities as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall inform the Sellers Representative of the commencement of any
audit, examination or proceeding (" _Tax Contest_ ") relating in whole or in
part to Taxes for which Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from Sellers
hereunder. With respect to any Tax Contest for which the Sellers are liable
under _Section 5.9(e)_ (after application of _Section 7.4_ ), the Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Contest; _provided, however_ , that (i) the
Sellers Representative shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of its intention
to control such Tax Contest, (ii) in the case of a Tax Contest relating to
Taxes of the Pecos Entities for a Straddle Period, the Sellers Representative
and Buyer shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any
such Tax Contest and (iii) if any Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on Buyer, the Pecos Entities, or any of their
Affiliates in any Tax period ending after the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date, the Tax Contest shall not be settled or resolved without Buyers
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice is given to the Sellers
Representative of the commencement of any Tax Contest and the Sellers
Representative does not, within thirty (30) days after Buyers notice is
given, give notice to Buyer of its election to assume the defense thereof (and
in connection therewith, acknowledge in writing the indemnification
obligations hereunder of the Sellers), the Sellers shall be bound by any
determination made in such Tax Contest or any compromise or settlement thereof
effected by Buyer. Buyer and the Pecos Entities shall use their reasonable
efforts to provide the Sellers Representative with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative in connection with a Tax
Contest controlled solely or jointly by the Sellers Representative.

 



 

(g) All sales and transfer taxes (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not
include any Texas gross margin or franchise tax), deed taxes, conveyance fees,
recording charges and similar taxes imposed as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, if any, together with any interest, penalties
or additions to such transfer taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be borne 50%
by the Sellers and 50% by Buyer.

 



 

(h) Buyer shall not cause or permit the Pecos Entities to amend any Tax Return
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or Straddle Period, or make any
election that has retroactive effect to any such period, to the extent that
the Sellers would be materially and adversely affected by such amendment or
election.

 



 

(i) Purchase Price Allocation.

 



 

(i) Consistent with the allocation schedules included in _Disclosure Schedule
5.9(i)_ , within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to the Sellers Representative a draft of a statement (the "
_Allocation Statement_ ") setting forth its proposed calculation of the
aggregate amount of the Purchase Price (including the amount of any assumed
liabilities) to be allocated among the assets of each of Black Hawk,
Midstream, Pecos, Striker and TransWest deemed purchased by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement and the proposed allocation of such aggregate amount among such
assets; ( _provided, however_ , Buyer shall be required to use the allocation
of the Purchase Price amongst the various companies comprising the Pecos
Entities by reference to _Disclosure Schedule 1.1(c)_ ). If within thirty (30)
days after the Sellers Representatives receipt of the draft Allocation
Statement, the Sellers Representative shall not have objected in writing to
such draft Allocation Statement, the draft Allocation Statement shall become
the Allocation Statement. In the event that the Sellers Representative objects
in writing within such 30-day period, the Sellers Representative and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Sellers
Representative and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement within thirty (30)
days after Buyers receipt of the Sellers Representatives written objection,
the dispute shall be resolved and the Allocation Statement shall be determined
by an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by
the parties hereto on the basis of the relative fair market value of all
assets as reasonably determined by such accounting firm; _provided, however_ ,
under no circumstances shall the accounting firm be permitted to use an
allocation of the Purchase Price amongst the various companies comprising the
Pecos Entities that differs from _Disclosure Schedule 1.1(c)_. The Allocation
Statement, as

 



      
 

 



 

agreed upon by Buyer and the Sellers Representative and/or determined under
this _Section 5.9(i)_ , shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto.
Each of Buyer on one hand and the Sellers on the other hand shall bear all
fees and costs incurred by Buyer and the Sellers Representative in connection
with the determination of the Allocation Statement, except that the parties
hereto shall each pay one-half (50%) of the fees and expenses of the
accounting firm.

 



 

(ii) The Allocation Statement will be prepared in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
Buyer and the Sellers Representative also shall allocate and report any
adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1060-1(e), and any allocations made as a result of such adjustments
shall become part of the Allocation Statement. After Closing, if there is an
adjustment to the Purchase Price and if such difference requires an adjustment
to the Allocation Statement in accordance with this _Section 5.9(i)_ , Buyer
shall prepare such adjustment to the Allocation Statement which adjustment
shall be submitted to Sellers Representative, and Sellers Representative and
Buyer shall use their best efforts to agree on the final adjustment within
thirty (30) days after the determination of the adjusted Purchase Price.

 



 

(iii) The parties hereto agree to report the allocation of the Purchase Price
(including the amount of any assumed liabilities) among the assets of each of
Black Hawk, Midstream, Pecos, Striker and TransWest deemed purchased by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Statement and agree to act in accordance with the Allocation Statement in the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns (including filing Form 8594 with
their respective federal income tax returns for the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date and any other forms or statements required by the Code,
Treasury Regulations, the Internal Revenue Service or any applicable state or
local Governmental Authority) and in the course of any Tax audit, Tax review
or Tax litigation relating thereto; _provided, however_ , that (i) Buyers
cost for the assets that it is deemed to acquire may differ from the total
amount allocated hereunder to reflect the inclusion in the total cost of items
(for example, capitalized acquisition costs) not included in the amount so
allocated and (ii) the amount realized by the Sellers may differ from the
total amount allocated hereunder to reflect transaction costs that reduce the
amount realized for federal income Tax purposes. If, contrary to the intent of
the parties hereto as expressed in this _Section 5.9(i)_ , any Governmental
Authority makes or proposes an allocation inconsistent with the Allocation
Statement as provided in this Section 5.9(i), Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in good faith to contest such Governmental
Authoritys allocation (or proposed allocation), _provided, however_ , that,
after consultation with the party (or parties) adversely affected by such
allocation (or proposed allocation), the other party (or parties) hereto may
file such protective claims or Tax Returns as may be reasonably required to
protect its (or their) interests; _provided_ that neither the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates nor Buyer or any of its Affiliates will be obligated to
litigate any challenge to such allocation of the Purchase Price by a
Governmental Authority.

 



 

(iv) The parties hereto will promptly inform one another of any challenge by
any Governmental Authority to any allocation made pursuant to this Section
5.9(i) and agree to consult and keep one another informed with respect to the
status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, such
challenge.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 5.10** ** ****Efforts**. Buyer expressly covenants and agrees to
cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be fully and timely funded at
Closing in accordance with, but subject to, the terms and conditions hereof.
From the date hereof until the Closing, the parties hereto shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to
expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _Article VI_
hereof.

 



 

 **Section 5.11** ** ****Operations Pending Close**. Except as required by
Applicable Law, as contemplated or permitted herein or as otherwise set forth
on _Disclosure Schedule 5.11_ , without the consent of Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), between the date
hereof and the Closing Date (or sooner termination), each of the Pecos
Entities will use commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) conduct its business
in the ordinary course, generally consistent with past practice, (b) continue
with maintenance capital expenditures in the ordinary course, generally
consistent with past practice ( _provided, however_ , the parties agree that
funding of the maintenance capital expenditures identified on the Capital
Expansion Budget shall be conclusively regarded as in the ordinary course and
consistent with past practice) and (c) preserve intact its business
organization, management, commercial relationships and goodwill, except that,
nothing in this _Section 5.11_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall preclude
or restrict in any way the ability of the Pecos Entities to declare, set
aside, make and/or pay distributions in respect of any of the Equity in
amounts necessary (or believed to be reasonably necessary) to pay any Sellers
Assumed Tax Liability.

 



 

 **Section 5.12** ** ****Exclusivity**. From the date hereof until the earlier
of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement (the " _Exclusivity
Period_ "), without the express prior written consent of Buyer, the Pecos
Entities shall not, directly or indirectly through any Representative or
otherwise, enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, or other
commitment (whether or not legally binding) relating to any acquisition of all
or a significant portion of the assets, or any sale of all or substantially
all of the Equity of the Pecos Entities (each, a " _Competing Transaction_ "),
or solicit, initiate, or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer
from any Person (including any of their officers, directors, employees, and
agents) relating to any Competing Transaction, nor participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any
information with respect to or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist
or participate in, facilitate, or encourage, any effort or attempt by any
Person to effect a Competing Transaction, nor agree in concept, (whether or
not legally binding), to a Competing Transaction involving any Person to occur
in the event that this Agreement is terminated. The Pecos Entities shall
promptly notify Buyer in the case of the receipt by any of the Pecos Entities
or its Representatives of any bona fide future proposals, offers, or
submissions with respect to a Competing Transaction.

 



 

 **Section 5.13** ** ****Failure to Obtain Consents**. In the event that the
Sellers and/or the Pecos Entities shall not have received all required
Consents but Buyer has nevertheless agreed to waive such condition and
otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
parties have agreed that, notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof,
neither the Sellers nor the Pecos Entities (through indemnification or
otherwise) shall have any liability or suffer any Losses to Buyer (or others
claiming through Buyer) in connection with such failure. In that event, Buyer
agrees that the sole risk of loss arising from such failure to obtain one or
more referenced Consents shall be borne by Buyer. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, this _Section 5.13_ shall not relieve the Sellers and/or the Pecos
Entities of any liability in the event they failed to identify a necessary
Consent pursuant to the applicable representation or warranty of _Article III_

 



 

 **Section 5.14** ** ****Control of Other Party s Business**. Prior to the
Closing Date, each of the parties will exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
respective operations and the operations of its businesses. Nothing in this
Agreement, including any of the actions, rights or restrictions set forth
herein, will be interpreted in such a way as to require any party to violate
any rule, regulation or policy of any Governmental Authority or Applicable
Law, relating to the control of another party.

 



 

 **Section 5.15** ** ****Books and Records**. In order to facilitate the
resolution of any claims made against or incurred by the Sellers, or for any
other legitimate business purpose, for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing, Buyer shall (i) retain the books and records (including personnel
files) of the Pecos Entities relating to periods prior to Closing in a manner
reasonably consistent with the current practice of Buyer; and (ii) upon
reasonable notice by the Sellers Representative, afford him and his
Representatives reasonable access (including the right to make, at the Seller
Representatives (on behalf of the Sellers) expense, copies thereof), during
normal business hours, to such books and records. Buyer shall not be obligated
to provide access to any books or records (including personnel files) pursuant
to this _Section 5.15_ where such access would violate Applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 5.16** ** ****Financial Statement Cooperation**. Following Closing,
the Sellers agree to provide to Buyer, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to provide to Buyer, all cooperation that is reasonably
necessary or required in connection with the preparation of audited and
unaudited financial statements for the Pecos Entities, pro forma financial
information, and other financial information regarding the Pecos Entities as
may be required by the rules and regulations of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission, which cooperation shall include the consideration
(and, if appropriate, execution) of reasonable and customary management
representation letters and other support reasonably requested by the auditors
of the Pecos Entities and/or Buyer. Buyer agrees to be solely responsible for
any reasonable fees, costs or expenses associated with Sellers cooperation
hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 5.17** ** ****Permitted Obligations**. At Closing, the Sellers
agree that the consolidated debts, obligations, losses or liabilities of the
Pecos Entities of the types listed on _Disclosure Schedule 1.1(e)_ shall be
equal to or less than $16,868,714, except to the extent otherwise taken into
account when calculating Working Capital.

 



 

 **Section 5.18** ** ****Further Assurances**. Following the Closing, each of
the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
execute and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.19** ** ****Toro Employees and Benefit Plans**. The Pecos
Entities hereby agree to take all actions necessary to cause Toro to transfer
to Pecos, on or about November 1, 2012, all employees of Toro (other than the
Reserved Employees) and all benefit plans associated with

 



      
 

 



 

such employees and the assets described on _Disclosure Schedule 5.19_ pursuant
to the terms of an assignment and assumption agreement, and Pecos shall assume
all liabilities in connection therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , Pecos shall
not acquire any real property or related facilities then held by Toro or any
liabilities associated with such real estate (the " _Toro Transfers_ ").

 **ARTICLE VII.**

 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

 **Section 7.1** ** ****Survival**.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties contained herein (and any certificate
or other Transaction Document executed in connection herewith), and the
related right to indemnification associated with any breach of representation
or warranty, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect but only until December 31, 2013; _provided, however_ (i) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.2_ (Capitalization of
the Pecos Entities), _Section 3.3_ (Ownership of Equity), _Section 3.5_
(Authority) and _Section 3.20_ (Taxes) (collectively, the " _Special
Representations_ "), shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the
statute of limitations relating to the subject matter thereof and (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.2_ (Authority) shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the statute of limitations
relating to the subject matter thereof. Upon the end of the applicable
survival period, the representations and warranties (together with any
associated right of indemnification) shall expire and terminate and be of no
further force and effect; _provided, however_ , that if a good faith claim for
Losses for which indemnification is sought hereunder is properly asserted in
writing within the survival period set forth above, then such claim shall
continue to survive until the date that such claim is conclusively resolved
(as provided herein).

 



 

(b) The covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date for the relevant statute of limitations period,
unless a different period is expressly contemplated thereby.

 



 

 **Section 7.2** ** ****Indemnification by the Sellers**. Subject to the other
terms and conditions of this _Article VII_, after the Closing, each Seller
(on a joint and several basis with the other Sellers) shall indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Persons against, and shall hold the Buyer Indemnified
Persons harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed
upon, the Buyer Indemnified Persons based upon, arising out of, with respect
to, or by reason of:

 



 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the Pecos
Entities contained in this Agreement (and any certificate or other Transaction
Document executed in connection herewith) without giving effect to any
supplement to the Disclosure Schedules (except to the limited extent
contemplated by _Section 5.3(b)_ hereof);

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Pecos Entities
or one or more of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) the termination of Glenn Waldrop.

 



 

 **Section 7.3** ** ****Indemnification by Buyer**. Subject to the other terms
and conditions of this _Article VII_, Buyer shall indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Persons against, and shall hold the Seller Indemnified Persons
harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon,
the Seller Indemnified Persons based upon, arising out of, with respect to or
by reason of:

 



       
 

 



 

(a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement (and any certificate or other Transaction Document executed
in connection herewith); or

 



 

(b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.4** ** ****Certain Limitations**. The indemnification provided
for in _Section 7.2(a)_ and _Section 5.9(e)_ shall be subject to the
following limitations:

 



 

(a) The Sellers shall not be liable (for indemnification or otherwise) to the
Buyer Indemnified Persons until the aggregate amount of the actual Losses in
respect of claims under _Section 7.2(a)_ and/or _Section 5.9(e)_ exceeds
Eight Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($825,000) (the " _Threshold_ "),
in which event, the Sellers, as a group, shall be jointly and severally liable
for all Losses over and above Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "
_Deductible_ "), subject to the other limitations contained in this _Article
VII_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers shall not
be liable (for indemnification or otherwise) to the Buyer Indemnified Persons
with respect to any individual claim (or series of claims arising from the
same or substantially similar facts or circumstances) where the amount of
actual Loss relating thereto is less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) (in
each case, an " _Ineligible Claim_ "). Amount(s) related to Ineligible Claims
shall _not_ be counted towards the Threshold or the Deductible. For purposes
of adding absolute clarity hereto, the parties recognize and agree that the
Sellers shall have no liability for Losses (under any theory whatsoever)
arising out of or related to Ineligible Claims (as provided in the immediately
preceding sentence).

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall not be liable (for indemnification or otherwise) to the
Buyer Indemnified Persons with respect to claims under _Section 7.2(a)_
and/or _Section 5.9(e)_ for aggregate Losses in excess of Seven Million, Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided, however_ ,
that the Cap shall not apply to breaches of the Special Representations or to
the indemnity provided for in _Section 5.9(e)_ but in both cases, shall
instead be subject to a separate limit on aggregate Losses related thereto of
Sixty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($62,500,000) (the " _Special
Rep. Cap_ "); _provided, further_ , that neither the Cap nor the Special Rep.
Cap shall apply to any claim against an individual Seller for Fraud as
provided in _Section 7.4(k)_ below (however, in that case, the aggregate
Losses for such claim shall not exceed the amount of the Purchase Price
actually received by that Seller _minus_ the amount of Losses otherwise
suffered by such Seller).

 



 

(c) Subject to the other limitations imposed by this _Article VII_, with
respect to any claims by the Buyer Indemnified Persons (or any Person claiming
through the Buyer Indemnified Persons), such claims shall first be paid and
satisfied from the Escrow Account, to the extent of any funds then remaining,
and only secondarily by the Sellers on a joint and several basis.

 



 

(d) Any Loss incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons (or Person claiming
through the Buyer Indemnified Persons) shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, by the amount of any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment received by the Buyer Indemnified
Persons (or the Pecos Entities) in respect of any such Loss or

 



      
 

 



 

claim associated with such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or indemnity,
consideration or other similar agreements for Losses prior to seeking
indemnification under this Agreement; _provided_ that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be permitted to make a concurrent claim under this Agreement so
as to preserve its rights hereunder.

 



 

(e) Any Loss incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be reduced, on a
dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount of any Tax refund or reduction in the
amount of Tax payable by the Buyer Indemnified Persons, the Pecos Entities or
any of their respective Affiliates (whether actually realized or expected to
be realized) arising from the incurrence or payment of the claim giving rise
to the Loss (a " _Net Tax Benefit_ ").

 



 

(f) Following the Closing, Buyer shall take, and cause its Affiliates,
including the Buyer Indemnified Persons, to take, commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance
that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including
incurring commercially reasonable costs to the extent necessary to remedy the
breach that gives rise to such Loss and the failure to so mitigate will
reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, all Loss resulting from such failure.
Without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge and agree that Buyer (and the Buyer Indemnified Persons) shall
have an obligation to mitigate costs and expenses associated with litigation
involving a Third-Party Claim, and, as such, no cost or expense associated
with prosecuting a counterclaim against any Third-Party Claim shall be
recoverable hereunder (unless such counterclaim has been authorized in writing
in advance of filing by the Sellers Representative, which authorization shall
not be unreasonably withheld).

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, Sellers shall not be
liable for any Losses based upon or arising out of any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Sellers or the Pecos Entities contained in
this Agreement or otherwise if the Sellers Representative (who shall bear the
burden of proof in connection therewith) can reasonably establish at law or in
equity (on behalf of the Sellers), by a preponderance of the evidence, that
Buyers Key Managers had Actual Knowledge of such breach on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer hereby represents to the Pecos Entities and the Sellers
that Buyers Key Managers do not have Actual Knowledge of a breach of any of
the representations or warranties contained in _Article III_ of this
Agreement. Buyer (on its own behalf and on behalf of all Buyer Indemnified
Persons) shall be deemed to have waived, in full, any breach of any of the
Pecos Entities and/or Sellers representations or warranties for which the
Sellers Representative (who shall bear the burden of proof in connection
therewith) reasonably establishes at law or in equity (on behalf of the
Sellers), by a preponderance of the evidence that Buyers Key Managers had
Actual Knowledge at Closing.

 



 

(h) Under no circumstances shall any liability recorded on the Pecos Entities
Financial Statements give rise to an indemnifiable Loss hereunder.

 



 

(i) Sellers shall not be liable for any Losses or any indemnification for
Taxes or other matters attributable to Third-Party Claims arising out of or
resulting from any issue, concern, inquiry, proceeding, audit, or set of
circumstances brought to the attention of such third-

 



      
 

 



 

party voluntarily by Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified Persons following Closing
(or their respective Representatives).

 



 

(j) Buyer (on its own behalf and on behalf of all Buyer Indemnified Persons)
expressly waives any right or rights of offset, whether under common law or
otherwise, and however styled or articulated, against any amount that is or
may be due any Seller following the Closing.

 



 

(k) Buyer (on its own behalf and on behalf of all Buyer Indemnified Persons)
expressly agrees that the only claim of fraud preserved hereunder is a claim
against an individual Seller for Fraud committed by that Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, notwithstanding
any other provision hereof, no Seller shall be liable for the fraud of any
other Person.

 



 

(l) _Buyer (on its own behalf and on behalf of all Buyer Indemnified Persons)
acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ were specifically
bargained for between the parties and were taken into account in arriving at
the Purchase Price. The Pecos Entities and the Sellers have specifically
relied upon the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ in agreeing to the Purchase
Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties
made hereunder. None of the Pecos Entities or the Sellers would have entered
into this Agreement but for the inclusion of this _Section 7.4_._

 



 

 **Section 7.5** ** ****Indemnification Procedures**.

 



 

(a) **Third-Party Claims**. If any party making a claim for indemnification
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding
made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a
" _Third-Party Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which
the party against whom the Indemnified Party is making a claim (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the defense of such Third-
Party Claim is prejudiced thereby (including in the event that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits material rights or defenses by reason of such
failure). Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall (i) describe the Third-
Party Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) include copies of all material written
evidence, correspondence, and information relating thereto, (iii) state the
provision(s) of this Agreement under which such claim is made (including
specifically if the claim relates to a breach of representation or warranty
hereof, the precise representation or warranty alleged to have been breached),
(iv) indicate the amount (or estimate of the amount) of the Loss that has been
or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party and (v) include such other
information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to
the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. It is
understood between the parties that the assumption of the defense by the
Indemnifying Party shall not

 



      
 

 



 

represent, under any circumstances, the concession by such Indemnifying Party
that it has any duty or obligation to indemnify. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to
_Section 7.5(b)_, it shall have the right to take such action as it deems
necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining
to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and
expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the
defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend
such Third-Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of
its election to defend as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party
may, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party
Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from
or relating to such Third-Party Claim. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate
with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the other
provisions hereof) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
the defending party, employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Indemnified Party shall have the right
at all times to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim hereunder
with its own counsel and at its own expense and (b) (i) if the Indemnified
Party is advised by outside counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party that a bona fide conflict of interest exists that requires
the Indemnified Person to be represented by separate counsel under the
applicable rules of professional responsibility, (ii) if the court in which
such Third-Party Claim is pending determines that a conflict of interest
exists such that the Indemnifying Partys counsel is prohibited by such court
to represent the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim or
(iii) if there is one or more bona fide defenses that could be asserted by the
Indemnified Party that could not be asserted by the Indemnifying Party or the
Indemnifying Partys counsel (on the Indemnified Partys behalf), the
Indemnified Party shall have the right at all times to take over and assume
control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to
any such Third-Party Claim which shall be (subject to the other terms and
provisions hereof) at the sole cost of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) **Settlement of Third-Party Claims**. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this _Section 7.5(b)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-
Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or
other obligation, sanction or restriction on the part of the Indemnified Party
and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such
Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to
such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to
the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified
Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such
event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party
Claim shall not exceed the value or amount of such settlement offer. If the
Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the
Third-Party Claim upon the terms set

 



      
 

 



 

forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified
Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_, it shall not
agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event,
however, that the Indemnified Party settles any claim without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (in violation of the previous sentence),
then, in that event, the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
obligations to indemnify hereunder unless such Indemnifying Party has acted
unreasonably in withholding its consent.

 



 

(c) **Direct Claims**. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not,
however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations,
except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby (including in the event that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or
defenses by reason of such failure). Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall (i) describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) include copies
of all material written evidence, correspondence and information relating
thereto, (iii) state the provision(s) of this Agreement under which such claim
is made (including, specifically, if the claim relates to a breach of
representation or warranty hereof, the precise representation or warranty
alleged to have been breached), (iv) indicate the amount (or estimate of the
amount) of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party
and (v) include such other information as the Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
its receipt of such notice and materials to respond in writing to such Direct
Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its Representatives to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what
extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such assistance (including access to the Pecos Entities premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records
in the possession or control of the Indemnified Party) as the Indemnifying
Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 7.6** ** ****Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments**. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

 



 

 **Section 7.7** ** ****Exclusive Remedies** _. Subject to _Section 9.11_
(Specific Performance) and _Section 5.3_ (Supplement to Disclosure
Schedules), Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims (expressly including claims against an
individual Seller for Fraud committed by that Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in_

 



      
 

 



 

 _ _Section 5.9(e)__ _ and _Article VII_. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Buyer hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims, remedies and causes of action for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have
against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Applicable Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section
5.9(e)_ and _Article VII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer expressly
waives and releases any and all other claims, remedies and causes of action,
including those relating to or arising out of fraud (whether fraud in the
inducement or other fraud claims). Nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall limit
any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief or specific
performance to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ were specifically
bargained for between the parties and were taken into account in arriving at
the Purchase Price. The Pecos Entities and the Sellers have specifically
relied upon the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ in agreeing to the Purchase
Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties
made hereunder. None of the Pecos Entities or the Sellers would have entered
into this Agreement but for the inclusion of this _Section 7.7_._

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII.**

 

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 8.1** ** ****Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Sellers, the Pecos Entities and
Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Pecos Entities and the Sellers
Representative, acting collectively, on the other hand, if the Closing shall
not have occurred on or before December 1, 2012 (the " _Drop Dead Date_ ");

 



 

(c) subject to _Section 5.3(b)_, by Buyer upon written notice to the Pecos
Entities and the Sellers if:

 



 

(i) Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement
but there has been a breach in any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Pecos Entities or any Seller pursuant to this Agreement
that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions specified in
_Section 6.2_ and such breach cannot be cured by the **** Drop Dead Date; or

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ shall
not have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date (other than those conditions
which by their nature, are to be taken or satisfied on the Closing Date),
unless such failure shall be due to the failure of Buyer to perform or comply
with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Closing; or

 



 

(iii) Buyer is terminating this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Section 5.3(c)_ above;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by the Pecos Entities and the Sellers, acting collectively upon written
notice to Buyer if:

 



 

(i) none of the Pecos Entities or the Sellers are then in material breach of
any provision of this Agreement but there has been a breach in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions
specified in _Section 6.3_ and such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be
cured by Buyer by the Drop Dead Date; or

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ shall
not have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date (other than those conditions
which by their nature, are to be taken or satisfied on the Closing Date),
unless such failure shall be due to the failure of the Pecos Entities or any
Seller to perform or comply with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by them prior to the
Closing; or

 



 

(e) by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Pecos Entities and the Sellers (in the
manner contemplated by _Section 9.9_ hereto), acting collectively, on the
other hand, in the event that:

 



 

(i) there shall be any Applicable Law that makes consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited;
or

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order
restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable (it being
agreed between the parties that Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly appeal any Governmental Order which has not become final
and non-appealable (and pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence)).

 



 

 **Section 8.2** ** ****Effect of Termination**. In the event that this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with this _Article VIII_, then
each of the parties shall be relieved of their duties and obligations arising
under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination
shall be without liability to Buyer, any Seller or the Pecos Entities;
_provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall relieve
Buyer, any Seller or the Pecos Entities of any liability for any Losses for
any willful and intentional breach of any representation or warranty or any
breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, (ii) nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall limit
any provision relating to the payment of fees and expenses or the commitment
to retain information as confidential, which in each case, shall survive any
such termination and (iii) Buyers election to terminate in accordance with
the provisions of _Section 5.3(c)_ above shall function as its exclusive
election of remedies in connection therewith.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX.**

 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** ** ****Expenses**. Except as otherwise expressly
contemplated otherwise herein, all costs, fees and expenses incurred by the
Pecos Entities and/or the Sellers in connection with

shall have occurred. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated otherwise
herein, all costs, fees and expenses of Buyer and/or its Affiliates in

occurred.

the words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation"; (ii) the word "or" is not exclusive; (iii)

Agreement as a whole and (iv) the words "ordinary course of business," or

operations of such Person (whether required to be authorized by the Board of
Directors or similar governing body or not) as well as common practices in
that Persons industry or industries to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

applicable ( _provided, however_ , the parties acknowledge and agree that Toro
has been eliminated from the transactions contemplated hereby, notwithstanding
the fact that Toro has been operated as an integrated part of the normal day-
to-day operations of the Pecos Entities historically). Unless the context
otherwise requires, references herein: (A) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (B) to an agreement,
instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other
document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent
permitted by the provisions thereof; and (C) to a statute means such statute
as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto
and any regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred to
herein shall be construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to
the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

 



 

 **Section 9.4** ** ****Headings**. The headings in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.5** ** ****Severability**. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

 **Section 9.6** ** ****Entire Agreement**. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits, the Disclosure Schedules and the other Transaction Documents)
constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement
with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes (except to
the extent otherwise preserved) all prior and contemporaneous representations,
warranties, understandings and agreements, both written and oral, with respect
to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement, the Exhibits and Disclosure
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the
Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will
control, unless expressly agreed otherwise.

 



 

 **Section 9.7** ** ****Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer may designate one or more of its Affiliates to assign
its rights and to perform its obligations hereunder (in any case, Buyer
nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of such
Affiliates obligations hereunder). No assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 9.8** ** ****No Third-Party Beneficiaries**. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein is intended to implicitly confer upon any other Person any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of

 



       
 

 



 

this Agreement. Any grant of third-party beneficiary rights hereunder is made
expressly subject to the last sentence of _Section 9.9_ hereof.

 



 

 **Section 9.9** ** ****Amendment and Modification; Consents; Waiver**. This
Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in
writing signed by the Pecos Entities, Buyer and the Sellers Representative.
Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Agreement shall be binding
on all of the parties hereto, including all of the Sellers, upon the execution
thereof in accordance with the foregoing sentence. No waiver by any party of
any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in
writing and signed by the party so waiving except that, prior to the Closing,
the Pecos Entities or the Sellers Representative may grant a waiver on behalf
of all of the Sellers and, following a Closing, the Sellers Representative may
grant a waiver on behalf of all of the Sellers. No waiver by any party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No
failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Whenever this
Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of any party hereto,
such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the
requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this _Section 9.9_.
For purposes of absolute clarity, the parties agree that no Person not a party
hereto (but, instead, merely listed as a third-party beneficiary hereof) shall
have any right to be consulted or notified in connection with any amendment,
modification, supplement, waiver or consent contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **Section 9.10** ** ****Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Submission to
Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Texas, without regard to any conflict of law provisions
thereof.

 



 

(b) Except for disputes requiring an accounting firm to finally resolve
disputes (including pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ ), and for ancillary and
other claims for injunctive relief and specific performance, all disputes,
claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any
other agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (each, a " _Transaction Dispute_ "), that are
not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved solely and exclusively by
the arbitration and mediation organization JAMS or its successor (" _JAMS_ ")
as provided herein. The parties understand and agree that this alternative
dispute resolution provision shall apply equally to preserved claims of Fraud.
Before any Transaction Dispute is submitted to arbitration, or before any
lawsuit is filed, the parties, each represented by a Representative authorized
to enter into an agreement and bind such party, shall meet to mediate the
Transaction Dispute. An unbiased mediator with JAMS shall be selected between
the parties (or, following an inability to agree upon an unbiased mediator
after five (5) Business Days, JAMS shall select an unbiased mediator) and the
parties shall in good faith engage in mediation of the Transaction Dispute.
The parties agree that such mediation shall

 



      
 

 



 

commence within thirty (30) days of the request of either party to mediate a
Transaction Dispute under this Agreement. In the event that the parties cannot
resolve the Transaction Dispute in mediation within thirty (30) days of
submitting the Transaction Dispute to mediation, the parties agree that such
Transaction Dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration. This agreement
to arbitrate shall not limit the Pecos Entities or the Sellers right to seek
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance. Once
appointed, the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any
Transaction Dispute, as well as any dispute relating to the interpretation,
applicability, enforceability or formation of this agreement to arbitrate,
including any claim that all or part of this Agreement is void or voidable and
any claim that an issue is not subject to arbitration. The mediation and
arbitration shall be held in **** Dallas, **** Texas before a single mediator
and a single arbitrator and shall be conducted in accordance with the rules
and regulations of JAMS unless specifically modified herein. The parties
covenant and agree that the arbitration shall commence within ninety (90) days
of the date on which mediation shall have ended. The arbitrator shall not have
the power to award damages in excess of the amounts allowed by this Agreement.
The parties shall bear their own attorneys fees, costs and expenses in
connection with the arbitration. The parties will share equally in the fees
and expenses charged by JAMS. Any and all of the arbitrators orders,
decisions and awards may be enforceable in, and judgment upon any award
rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and entered by, any federal or
state court having jurisdiction. All proceedings conducted pursuant to this
agreement to arbitrate, including any order, decision or award of the
arbitrator, shall be kept confidential by all parties.

 



 

(c) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO
_SECTION 9.10(b)_ OR ANY SUIT TO ENFORCE THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR FOR ANCILLARY AND OTHER INJUNCTION OR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE SHALL
BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE
COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF DALLAS ****
COUNTY, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS,
SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH
HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER
PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION
OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD
OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 



 

(d) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL

 



      
 

 



 

ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10(d)_.

 



 

 **Section 9.11** ** ****Specific Performance**. Except as otherwise expressly
provided, all rights and remedies of each of the parties under this Agreement
will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies will
not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available under this
Agreement, Applicable Law or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, the
parties acknowledge that irreparable damages would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or threatened not to be
performed, in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be adequate for any
such damages. It is accordingly agreed that each party (with the Pecos
Entities and Sellers, acting through the Sellers Representative) shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is expressly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the Closing. The
parties hereto further agree that no party shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or equivalent in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referenced in this _Section 9.11_ and the parties waive
any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or equivalent;
_provided, however_ , to the extent any such bond or equivalent is required by
Applicable Law or Governmental Order, the parties expressly agree and intend
that a bond or equivalent in the amount of $100 shall be sufficient and
reasonable.

 



 

 **Section 9.12** ** ****Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document shall be
deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of
this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 9.13** ** ****Sellers Representative**.

 



 

(a) Each Seller, for himself and for his or her successors and assigns, hereby
irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Sellers Representative as his
or her true and lawful attorney-in-fact to act for and on behalf of such
Seller with respect to any matter arising under this Agreement and/or any of
the other Transaction Documents, and, by executing below in his capacity as
the Sellers Representative, Gerald L. Jensen, hereby expressly accepts such
appointment. Each Seller acknowledges that the appointment of the Sellers
Representative is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked.

 



 

(b) In furtherance of the appointment of the Sellers Representative, each
Seller, fully and without restriction: (i) acknowledges receiving, reviewing
and understanding the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents; (ii) agrees to be bound by all notices given and
received and agreements and determinations made by and documents executed and
delivered by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement, the Expense
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; and (iii) authorizes the
Sellers

 



      
 

 



 

Representative to (A) deliver to Buyer all certificates and documents to be
delivered to Buyer by the Sellers (or the Sellers Representative on behalf of
the Sellers) pursuant to this Agreement, the Expense Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, together with any certificates and documents executed
by the Sellers and deposited with the Sellers Representative for such purpose,
(B) dispute or refrain from disputing any claim made by Buyer under this
Agreement, the Expense Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (C)
negotiate and compromise any dispute which may arise under this Agreement, the
Expense Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (D) pay any amounts due
Buyer from the Sellers under this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, (E) exercise or refrain from exercising any remedies available to
the Sellers (or the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers) under
this Agreement, the Expense Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (F)
sign any releases or other documents with respect to any such dispute or
remedy, (G) waive any condition contained in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, (H) give such notices and instructions and do or
refrain from doing such other things as the Sellers Representative, in his
sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement, the Expense Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (I)
take any and all actions and make any decisions required or permitted to be
taken by him under the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the
exercise of the power to authorize delivery to Buyer of cash out of the Escrow
Account in satisfaction of claims by Buyer, to petition the Escrow Agent for
the release of any or all funds due to the Sellers under the Escrow Agreement
and, subject to the Sellers Representatives other responsibilities under this
subsection, to pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of such funds,
(J) receive all amounts payable by Buyer to the Sellers under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Sellers and, subject to the Sellers
Representatives other responsibilities under this subsection, pay to each
Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of such amounts, (K) pay out of funds
coming into the hands of the Sellers Representative from Buyer (including from
the Expense Account) or the Escrow Agent all fees and expenses of the Sellers
(and of the Sellers Representative acting in such capacity) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
including without limitation the fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors retained by or on behalf of the Sellers (or the
Sellers Representative) in connection with such transactions, (L) retain such
counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as the Sellers
Representative reasonably deems necessary to assist it in the performance of
its duties hereunder and pay the fees, costs and expenses thereof out of the
funds coming into the hands of the Sellers Representative, (M) retain out of
funds coming into the hands of the Sellers Representative from Buyer or the
Escrow Agent, including by depositing such amounts into the Expense Account,
such amounts as the Sellers Representative, in its sole discretion, deems
appropriate to be held as reserves including for expected or potential future
expenses or liabilities of the Sellers hereunder or as otherwise deemed
appropriate by the Sellers Representative as a litigation reserve or
otherwise, (N) control, maintain and use the Expense Account as the Sellers
Representative determines in its sole discretion is in the best interests of
the Sellers and (O) to petition the Escrow Agent for the release to the
Sellers of the Expense Reserve Amount in accordance with each Sellers Pro
Rata Share of such amounts. Payments made by the Sellers Representative under
this subsection will be considered to be paid by all Sellers in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares. As used in this Agreement, a Sellers "
_Pro Rata Share_ " means such Sellers Percentage Interest.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers Representative
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and no Seller nor any other
Person shall have any claim or cause of action against the Sellers
Representative, and the Sellers Representative shall have no liability to any
Seller or any other Person, for any action taken, decision made or instruction
given by the Sellers Representative in connection with this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, except in the case of his or her own gross
negligence or willful misconduct (it being the explicit intention of the
Sellers that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel (acting
in good faith) shall be without gross negligence or willful misconduct). In
determining the occurrence of any such event or contingency, the Sellers
Representative may request from any one or more of the Sellers such reasonable
additional evidence as the Sellers Representative in his sole discretion may
deem necessary to determine any fact relating to the occurrence of such event
or contingency, and may at any time inquire of and consult with others,
including any one or more of the Sellers, and the Sellers Representative shall
not be liable to any of the Sellers for any damages resulting from its delay
in acting hereunder pending its receipt and examination of additional evidence
requested by him. In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Sellers
Representative shall be entitled to rely upon any document or instrument
reasonably believed by it to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by
any Seller.

 



 

(d) If the Sellers Representative resigns, dies or becomes incapacitated,
Jonathan E. Jensen shall automatically become the first successor thereto (and
by execution below agrees to such appointment). However, if Jonathan E. Jensen
resigns, dies or becomes incapacitated, his successor will be appointed within
fifteen (15) days of such event by the Sellers owning a majority of the Equity
immediately prior to the Closing. The Sellers owning a majority of the Equity
immediately prior to Closing have the right, at any time, to remove the then-
acting Sellers Representative and to appoint a successor Sellers
Representative determined in their discretion; _provided, however_ , neither
such removal of the then-acting Sellers Representative nor such appointment of
a successor Sellers Representative shall be effective until the delivery to
each of Buyer and the then-acting Sellers Representative of executed
counterparts of a writing signed by Sellers owning a majority of the Equity
immediately prior to the Closing, together with an acknowledgment for the
benefit of the Sellers signed by the successor Sellers Representative whereby
he, she or it agrees to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this
Agreement applicable to the Sellers Representative. The decisions and actions
of any successor Sellers Representative will be, for all purposes, those of
the Sellers Representative as if originally named herein. The death or
incapacity of any Seller will not terminate the authority and agency of the
Sellers Representative. Any successor Sellers Representative will provide
Buyer with prompt written notice of his, her or its appointment.

 



 

(e) Buyer will be entitled to rely exclusively upon any communication given or
other action taken by the Sellers Representative and will not be liable to the
Sellers or any other Person for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon
the Sellers Representative. Buyer will not be obligated to inquire as to the
authority of the Sellers Representative (or any successor) with respect to the
taking of any action that the Sellers Representative takes on behalf of the
Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) The Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify the Sellers
Representative and hold him or her harmless against any and all Loss,
liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct
on the part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection
with his or her duties as the Sellers Representative. The Sellers
Representative shall have the option, but not the requirement, to pay for such
Losses, liabilities or expenses out of the Expense Account or, to the extent
funds remain in the Escrow Account and are otherwise payable or distributable
to the Sellers, out of the Escrow Account; _provided, however_ , reasonable
documentation exists therefor. The Sellers Representative shall not be
entitled to be paid for his or her services hereunder unless and until a
separate agreement relating to such compensation shall be signed by the
Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and the Sellers owning a majority of
the Equity immediately prior to the Closing, on the other hand.

 



 

 **Section 9.14** ** ****Conflicts**. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives and
Affiliates, that the Pecos Entities are the clients of Andrews Kurth LLP and
J. David Washburn (collectively, " _AK LLP_ "). After the Closing, it is
possible that AK LLP will represent one or more of the Sellers, the Sellers
Representative and/or their respective Representatives and Affiliates
(individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with a
variety of matters, including matters adverse or potentially adverse to the
interests of Buyer and/or the Pecos Entities. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agree that AK LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to
all or a portion of the Seller Group, in connection with any such matter,
including any Transaction Dispute. Each of the parties hereto consents to such
representation, and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of
the parties hereto acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary,
that it has been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted
with counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.
Each of the parties further agrees that all communications or privileged
materials between AK LLP, on the one hand, and the Pecos Entities (or any
Representative of the Pecos Entities) or a Seller, on the other hand, prior to
the Closing (together with any other legally protected or privileged
communications or materials including those between members of the Seller
Group) (collectively, " _Privileged Materials_ ") are the property of the
Sellers (as a group) and that Buyer and the Pecos Entities cannot obtain
copies of, or access to, any such Privileged Materials without a waiver from
the Sellers Representative. Each of the parties hereby expressly agrees that,
at and after the Closing (and continuing indefinitely thereafter), any
privilege related to any of the Privileged Materials shall be solely
controlled by the Sellers acting collectively through the Sellers
Representative. Buyer further agrees that it will not and that it will not
permit the Pecos Entities to seek to obtain any such Privileged Materials,
including by way of review of any electronic communications or documents or by
seeking to have the Sellers and/or the Sellers Representative waive the
attorney-client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Buyer (or
the Pecos Entities) has the right to waive the attorney-client or other
privilege. In the event that Buyer or the Pecos Entities is required by
Governmental Order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of such Privileged
Materials, Buyer shall immediately (and, in any event, within two (2) Business
Days) notify the Sellers Representative in writing (including by making
specific reference to this Section) so that the Sellers Representative can
seek a protective order, and Buyer agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist therewith.
