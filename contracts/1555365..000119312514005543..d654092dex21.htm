of its specific objections. If the Sellers 

 



20  Representative does not deliver a Sellers Objection within such 30-day
period, the Closing Statement as delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Section

American Arbitration Association) (the "Neutral Accounting Firm") within seven
(7) days following the conclusion of such 20-day period, who shall act as an
accounting expert and not as an arbitrator and shall issue a final and binding
resolution with respect to all Disputed Items in accordance with the

representatives of each party hereto, including without limitation the
Sellers Representative, incurred in connection with their preparation or
review of the Closing Statement and the preparation or review of any Sellers
Objection, as applicable, shall be borne by such party. The Closing

7.6 _Confidentiality_. The confidentiality agreement dated May 30, 2013
between Buyer and Earthbound III (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall
continue in full force and effect until the Closing Date, at which time such
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If for any reason this Agreement is

nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity
to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statement with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such

except as may be required by applicable Law, in which case the party proposing
to issue such press release or make such public statement shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party
before issuing such press release or making such public statement to attempt
to agree upon mutually satisfactory text. Upon the Closing, the Company and
Buyer shall issue a mutually agreed upon press release announcing the

business so long as the disclosure is consistent with the press release.

 



49 7.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Companies and their Subsidiaries, to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, in accordance with and to the extent set forth in
the organizational documents of the Surviving Companies (in effect on the date
hereof) and the indemnification agreements set forth on _Schedule 7.8_
(the "Indemnification Agreements"), each Person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an
officer or director of the Earthbound Group (in such parties capacity
as such) (the "DandO Indemnified Parties") against any and all losses, damages,
Liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and
other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending the foregoing) arising out of or relating to any threatened or
actual action based in whole or in part on or arising out of or relating in
whole or in part to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer
of the Earthbound Group whether pertaining to any matter existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed prior to, or
at or after, the Closing Date (the "DandO Indemnified Liabilities"), including
all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent a corporation is
permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own directors or officers but
subject to the organizational documents of the Surviving Companies (in effect
on the date hereof) and the Indemnification Agreements (and the Surviving
Companies and their Subsidiaries shall pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each DandO Indemnified Party).
Without limiting the foregoing but subject to the limitations thereof, in the
event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought
against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Closing
Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it
and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and the Surviving Companies and their
Subsidiaries shall pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO
Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii) the
Surviving Companies and their Subsidiaries and each DandO Indemnified Party will
use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such
matter; _provided_ , that none of the Surviving Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries or Buyer shall be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 7.8_ shall notify Buyer promptly upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (but the failure so to notify
shall not relieve a party from any Liability that it may have under this
_Section 7.8_ except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such
party). The parties hereto agree that all rights to indemnification hereunder,
including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of
any such action or suit, existing in favor of the DandO Indemnified Parties
with respect to matters occurring through the Closing Date shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of not less than six (6) years from the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any DandO Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities.

 

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges that certain DandO Indemnified Parties may have
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by Persons other than the Earthbound Group (collectively, the "Indemnitors").
Buyer hereby agrees (i) that Buyer and the Earthbound Group are the
indemnitors of first resort (i.e., their obligations to the DandO Indemnified
Parties are primary and any obligation of the Indemnitors are secondary) and
(ii) Buyer and the Earthbound Group shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party and shall be liable
for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts
paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the
terms of this Agreement, the Indemnification Agreements, the DandO Tail Policy
or other director and officer insurance policies of Buyer or the Earthbound
Group or the Earthbound Groups certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
comparable organizational documents (or any other agreement between any 

 



50  member of the Earthbound Group and any such DandO Indemnified Party)
(collectively, the "Coverage Related Agreements"), without regard to any
rights the DandO Indemnified Party may have against the Indemnitors; provided,
however, that if the foregoing adversely affects, contravenes, or impairs
coverage under, any of the Coverage Related Agreements, then the covenants and
agreements of Buyer set forth in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above shall be
limited to avoid any such adverse effect, contravention or impairment. Each of
Buyer and the Earthbound Group further agree that no advancement or payment by
an Indemnitor on behalf of a DandO Indemnified Party with respect to any claim
for which a DandO Indemnified Party has sought indemnification from the
Earthbound Group shall affect the foregoing and the applicable Indemnitor
shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of the DandO Indemnified
Party against the Earthbound Group. Buyer and the Indemnitees agree that the
Indemnitors and the DandO Indemnified Parties are express third party
beneficiaries of the terms of this _Section 7.8_.

(c) The Surviving Companies as of the Closing shall obtain and fully pay for,
at the Surviving Companys expense, a "tail" insurance policy of officers and
directors Liability insurance (the "DandO Tail Policy") for the Persons who are
covered by the existing directors and officers Liability insurance policy
of the Earthbound Group with respect to matters arising out of or relating to
acts or omissions occurring or existing at or prior to the Closing (including
in connection with this Agreement and the Subject Transactions). The DandO Tail
Policy shall have a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Closing and shall provide coverage not less favorable than the coverage
provided by the existing directors and officers Liability insurance policy
of the Earthbound Group; provided, however, that the Surviving Companies shall
not be obligated to make annual payments for such insurance to the extent that
such premiums exceed 150% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof
by the Surviving Companies for such insurance (such 150% amount, the "Base
Premium"); provided, further, if such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at
all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Base
Premium, the Surviving Companies shall maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an annual premium not to
exceed the Base Premium.

 

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 7.8(d)_ , Buyer covenants, for itself and
its successors and assigns, that it and they shall not institute any action
in any court or before any administrative agency or before any other tribunal
against any of the current directors of the Earthbound Group, in their
capacity as such, with respect to any Liabilities, actions or causes of
action, judgments, claims or demands of any nature or description
(consequential, compensatory, punitive or otherwise), in each such case to the
extent resulting from their approval of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(e) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Surviving
Companies shall not take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or
adversely affect the provisions of the organizational documents or the
Indemnification Agreements of the Earthbound Group that provide
indemnification of and expense reimbursement to DandO Indemnified Parties.

 

(f) In the event that the Earthbound Group or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger;
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Topco or the Surviving
Companies shall assume all of the obligations of the Earthbound Group set
forth in this _Section 7.8_.

 



51 7.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause

documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions

applicable to the Mergers or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Mergers are
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Mergers and any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Earthbound Group and
Buyer will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect
to the Mergers under the HSR Act. All fees and expenses associated with
notices, reports and filings contemplated by this _Section 7.9(a)_ shall be
borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Earthbound Group, on the
other hand.

 

(b) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the
Earthbound Group shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith
the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
Buyer or the Earthbound Group, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to any documents or
materials required to be filed under the HSR Act or any antitrust or
competition Laws of any other applicable jurisdiction that contain information
that is confidential or proprietary to the providing party, such party shall
not be required to provide such information directly to the third party and/or
Governmental Entity. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the
Earthbound Group and Buyer shall act reasonably and as promptly
as practicable.

(c) Without limiting _Section 7.9(a)_, Buyer shall take, and shall cause its
Affiliates to take (and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Earthbound Group and its Affiliates shall be permitted to take,
without affecting any representation, warranty, covenant or condition in this
Agreement), commercially reasonable actions necessary in order to ensure that
(A) no requirement for any non-action, consent or approval of the Federal
Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice or any other applicable Governmental Entity, (B) no decree, Order or
judgment and (C) no other matter relating to any U.S. or non-U.S. competition,
antitrust, merger control or investment Law, would preclude, impair or delay
the consummation of the Mergers or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. For clarification, commercially reasonable actions shall not
include, by consent decree or otherwise, taking any action that would have a
material adverse effect on Buyer or the Surviving Companies.

 



52 (d) Within two (2) Business Days after the date hereof, the Earthbound Group

Topco Seller and each of the Earthbound Holders set forth on _Schedule 7.9(d)_

to Buyer, and Buyer shall give notice to the Earthbound Group, as promptly as
reasonably practicable upon acquiring Knowledge of (a) any fact, change,
condition, circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence (an "Event") that

condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such party

Legal Proceeding against a member of the Earthbound Group related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ , that

hereto pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement, (C) an indemnification claim,
(D) any tort or extra-contractual claim, or (E) result in a breach of

supplement to the Schedules specifying such Event and the related change
shall be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by
reason of such Event.

Closing completed all transactions necessary in order to effectuate a
charitable contribution of those certain parcels of real estate in the

commercial efforts to assist the Sellers Representative following the Closing

Company cause the Company to promptly provide the Sellers Representative

by the Company relating to such contribution, net of any and all costs and
expenses (including Taxes) incurred by the Buyer or the Company in connection
therewith, so long as the contribution is completed on or prior to March 17,
2014. The foregoing shall in no event impact any obligation of the Earthbound
Group to provide the indemnification to the Buyer post-Closing as contemplated
by this Agreement. To the extent necessary for Tax purposes, the foregoing
contribution may also be structured as a sale of the entity holding the
parcels or a liquidation of such entity following such contribution, as
approved by Buyer.

giving effect to any limitation or qualification as to "materiality"
(including the word "material") or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the performance by the Company Group of its obligations under this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



57 (ii) _Performance_. The Sellers Representative and the Earthbound Group
shall have performed and complied in all material respects with all
agreements, obligations, and covenants required by this Agreement to be so
performed or complied with by the Sellers Representative and the Earthbound
Group at or prior to the Earthbound Closing.

Buyer a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, executed by the Sellers

(iv) _Consents and Approvals_. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
under the HSR Act shall have expired or shall have been terminated.

(v) _Deliveries_. The items set forth in  _Section 8.4_ shall have been
delivered.

(vi) _Legality of Subject Transactions_. No injunction, restraining order or
other ruling or Order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or

8.3 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. Neither the Company Group nor Buyer
may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 8.1(a) nor
Section 8.1(b), as the case may be, if such failure was primarily caused by
such partys failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement.

 

8.4 _Closing Deliverables_. On or before Closing, the Earthbound Group will

related to the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV,_  (B)

resulting from, or attributable to, (i) any breach of the representations and
warranties (A) contained in _Article VI_ or in the certificate delivered to
Company Group pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ or (B) contained in _Section
11.17(b)_, (ii) any breach of any of the covenants or other agreements of
Buyer or the Surviving Companies contained in this Agreement or (iii) the

Claim.

(c) THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN _SECTION 10.2(a)_ ARE
INTENDED BY THE PARTIES TO APPLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR TERMS, AND SUBJECT
TO ANY LIMITATIONS STATED THEREIN, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER STRICT LIABILITY
(INCLUDING UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND
LIABILITY ACT 42 U.S.C. Section 9601, et seq) OR THE FAULT OF ANY OF THE
PARTIES TO BE INDEMNIFIED (INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE, IN FULL OR IN PART, OF
ANY SUCH PARTY) IS ALLEGED OR PROVEN IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR WHICH
INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE
FOREGOING PROVISIONS (i) DO NOT ALTER THE AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES IN
_SECTION 10.2(a)_ AND (ii) ARE INTENDED SOLELY TO COMPLY WITH THE EXPRESS
NEGLIGENCE RULE AND ARE CONSPICUOUS.

10.3 _Claims Procedure; Participation in Litigation_.

 

(a) Procedure for Claims. For purposes hereof, a party claiming a right to
indemnification shall be referred to as the "Indemnified Party" and the party
against whom such indemnification claim is made shall be referred to as the

 



61  "Indemnifying Party." An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a claim for
indemnification under Section 10.2 (other than a Third-Party Claim covered by
Section 10.3(b) below) shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a certificate
(an "Indemnification Notice") signed by any officer of the Indemnified Party,
(A) stating the Indemnified Partys good faith estimate of the Indemnified
Losses (the aggregate amount of such estimate of Indemnified Losses being
referred to as the "Claimed Amount"), (B) to the extent reasonably available
to, and reasonably determinable by, the Indemnified Party, specifying in
reasonable detail the facts pertinent to such claim(s), the individual items
of Indemnified Losses included in the amount so stated, the method of
computation thereof and the basis for indemnification to which such item is
related and (C) demanding payment of the Claimed Amount if such amount shall
have been finally determined; provided, however, that the failure of the
Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of the asserted claim shall
not preclude the Indemnified Party from any indemnification which it may
claim in accordance with this Article X except to the extent that such
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or
failure. Within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of such
Indemnification Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall:
(1) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, (2) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but
not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") and, to the extent
reasonably available to, and reasonably determinable by, the Indemnifying
Party, specifying in reasonable detail, the reasons why the Indemnified Party
is not entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount or (3) contest that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount and
specifying in reasonable detail, to the extent reasonably available to,
and reasonably determinable by, the Indemnifying Party, the reasons why the
Indemnified Party is not entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount. In the
case of (1) or (2) above where the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified
Party, the Sellers Representative and the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent, within three (3) Business Days following delivery of such
written response, a written notice executed by both such parties instructing
the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Indemnified Party, from and to the
extent of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, an amount equal to the Claimed Amount
or Agreed Amount, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Party in such response
contests the payment of all or part of the Claimed Amount, then the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to
resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 10.3(c) below.

 

(b) _Procedure for Third-Party Claims_. Except with respect to any Losses
resulting from a breach of any Tax Representation or any matter referred to
in _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, which shall be governed exclusively by _Section
7.10(e)_:

(i) All claims for indemnification made under _Section 10.2_ resulting from,
related to or arising out of a Third-Party Claim against an Indemnified Party
shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. In the event an
Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third-party claim which such Indemnified
Party reasonably believes may result in any Indemnified Losses (without giving
effect to the limitations in _Section 10.5_) (a "Third-Party Claim"),
such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such
claim by delivery of an Indemnification Notice to such Indemnifying Party. Any
delay or failure in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of obligations under _Section 10.2_ except to the extent
that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such delay
or failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to be represented by
counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with any such Third-Party Claim; provided, further, that the attorneys fees
and other costs and expenses of the Indemnifying Party shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party, which shall be paid from and reduce the amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. If the Indemnifying Party is

 



62  entitled to and elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise
deal with a Third-Party Claim, it shall, within thirty (30) days of the
Indemnifying Partys receipt of the Indemnification Notice with respect to
such Third-Party Claim, notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so.
If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party may participate, at his or its own expense, in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , that such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, which shall be paid from and
reduce the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Amount, if (i) so requested by the
Indemnifying Party to participate or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnifying Party, the named parties in the Third Party Claim include
both a member of the Earthbound Group and a party who is not a member of the
Earthbound Group and one or more defenses are available to the Indemnified
Party that is not a member of the Earthbound Group which is different from or
in addition to those defenses available to the Indemnified Party that is a
member of the Earthbound Group; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel
(plus any appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 10.3_, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any Third-
Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with
respect thereto unless such settlement, compromise or judgment contains an
unqualified release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect
of the Third-Party Claim.

(ii) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend against, negotiate, settle
or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided or contests its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such Losses under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim using counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnifying Party and at the Indemnifying Partys expense, which shall
be paid from and reduce the amount of the Indemnity Escrow Amount. The party
controlling the defense of any Third-Party Claim (the "Controlling Party")
shall (i) permit the other party (the "Non-Controlling Party") to participate,
at his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim, (ii)
conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and
keep the Non-Controlling Party reasonably informed of material developments in
such Third-Party Claim at all stages thereof, (iii) promptly submit to the
Non-Controlling Party copies of all pleadings, responsive pleadings, motions
and other similar legal documents and papers received or filed in connection
therewith, (iv) permit the Non-Controlling Party and its counsel to confer on
the conduct of the defense thereof and (v) permit the Non-Controlling Party
and its counsel an opportunity to review all legal papers to be submitted
prior to their submission and consider in good faith any comments from the
Non-Controlling Party and its counsel thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 10.3_, the Indemnified Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle or compromise any Third-
Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with
respect thereto without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.
In the event the Indemnified Party fails to diligently pursue the defense of
any Third-Party Claim, in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnifying Partys
counsel, the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter have the right to defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim
notwithstanding the limitation in the immediately preceding sentence.

(iii) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the investigation, trial and
defense of any Third-Party Claim and any appeal arising therefrom and shall
furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be

 



63  reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include
access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party and its
agents and representatives to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified
Party of, records and information which have been identified by the
Indemnifying Party as being reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Party incurred in
connection with the cooperation contemplated by this _Section 10.3(b)(iii)_
shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Indemnifying Party shall object in
writing to any claim or claims made in any Indemnification Notice, the
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims
within thirty (30) days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of
its response to such Indemnification Notice. If the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim
against the Indemnity Escrow Amount, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make
distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms
thereof.

10.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. With respect to any indemnity payment made
pursuant to Section 10.2(a) (other than Section 10.2(a)(i)(B), Section
10.2(a)(iii)(B) or to the extent attributable to Topco pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(i)(A) of this Agreement) the parties agree to treat, to the extent
permitted by Law, all such payments as an adjustment to the Final Merger
Consideration paid hereunder. With respect to any indemnity payment made
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)(B), Section 10.2(a)(iii)(B) and to the extent
attributable to Topco pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)(A) of this Agreement,
the parties agree to treat, to the extent permitted by Law, all such payments
as an adjustment to the Topco Closing Consideration paid hereunder.

 

10.5 _Limitations_.

(a) Except with respect to Special Claims, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ unless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties have sustained Indemnified Losses in excess of
$4,600,000 in the aggregate (the "Deductible"), in which case the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to all sustained Indemnified Losses that
are in excess of the Deductible (subject to _Section 10.5(b)_ below); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled
to indemnification under this _Article X_ for any individual Indemnified Loss
(or group or series of Indemnified Losses based on substantially similar sets
of facts or circumstances) in excess of $100,000 (a "Qualifying Loss") and
only the amount of Qualifying Losses shall count in the calculation and
determination of whether the Deductible has been satisfied.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to any Losses to the extent that such Losses are already a part of or
reflected as part of the Final Merger Consideration or Topco Closing
Consideration.

 



64 (c) The amount of any Indemnified Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this  _Article X_ shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such
Indemnified Losses (other than the RandW Insurance Policy) and (ii) the amount
of any Tax benefit recognized in cash by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates in connection with such Indemnified Loss or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto; provided that to the extent a Tax benefit
is received after an Indemnified Loss is paid to the Indemnified Party shall
be required to remit such Tax benefit to the Indemnifying Party for payment;
it being understood that the Shareholders Representative should be entitled
to receive such amount on behalf of the Earthbound Holders and distribute
such amount in accordance with the Residual Percentages. The Indemnified
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any available
insurance policies or collateral sources, and in the event the
Indemnified Parties receive any recovery, the amount of such recovery (which
shall be net of any increases in premiums or deductibles relating thereto and
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Parties in collecting such
amount including reasonable attorneys fees) shall be applied first, to
refund any payments made by the Indemnifying Parties in respect of
indemnification claims pursuant to this _Article X_ which would not have been
so paid had such recovery been obtained prior to such payment, and second,
any excess to the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification under this
_Article X_ with respect to any Losses to the extent such Losses (i) relate
to any item included on, or is a liability accrued for on or reserved or
reflected in, the Balance Sheet or the Estimated Closing Statement; (ii) arise
out of changes after the Closing Date in applicable Law or interpretations or
applications thereof; or (iii) are duplicative of Losses that have
previously been recovered hereunder.

(e) Except with respect to any Losses resulting from a breach of any Tax
Representation or any matter referred to in _Section 10.2(a)(iii)_, each of
the parties agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its
respective Indemnified Losses to the extent reasonably possible upon becoming
aware of the occurrence of any event or condition that would reasonably be
expected to result in Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. In addition,
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Earthbound Holders shall not have any
liability under any provision of this Agreement to the extent that the
applicable Loss was caused by actions taken by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party after the Closing.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Indemnified
Losses shall not include (i) any consequential or punitive damages, unless
such Indemnified Losses are (A) recovered from an Indemnified Party pursuant
to the Third-Party Claim or (B) solely in the case of consequential damages,
the natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of the event that gave
rise to such Indemnified Losses or (ii) any damages based on multiples of
earnings or other financial metrics or loss of reputation or business
opportunity.

(g) Upon payment in full of any indemnification claim pursuant to this 
_Article X_, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such
payment to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person with respect
to the subject matter of such claim. The Indemnified Parties shall permit
the Indemnifying Party to use the name of such Indemnified Parties in any
transaction or in any action or proceeding or other matter involving any of
such rights, and the Indemnified Parties shall assign or otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties, at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Parties, to pursue any claims against, or otherwise recover
amounts from, any Person liable or responsible for any Losses for which
indemnification has been received pursuant to this Agreement. If any
indemnification payment is received by any Indemnified Party from an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article X_, and such Indemnified Party
later receives a payment from another Person in respect of the
identical Losses, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to such
Indemnifying Party or its designee an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the
actual amount of such payment received from such other Person and (b) the
actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by such
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses.

 



65 (h) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or
warranties to be true and correct and calculating Losses hereunder, in each
case solely for purposes of indemnification under this _Article X_ , any
materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements shall be disregarded; _provided_ that
materiality qualifications shall not be disregarded for purposes of (i) the
definition of Permitted Liens, and any use of thereof in this Agreement, (ii)
_Section 4.6_, (iii) Sections  _4.9(b) and (c)_ (including references to
materiality in _Section 7.1_ for the purposes of applying _Section 4.9(c)_),
(iv) _Section 4.12(b)_, (v) _Section 4.15(a)_, the definition
of "Material Contracts, and the use thereof in this Agreement, (vi)
_Sections 4.16(b)(iii)_ and _(viii)_ , (vii) _Section 4.18_ , (viii)
_Section 4.19(b)_ ; (ix) _Sections 4.21(f)_ and the definition
of "Environmental Permits", and the use thereof in this Agreement, (x)
_Section 4.24_ or (xi) _Sections 7.1(a)_ - _(n)_.

 

(i) No Indemnified Party shall have any right to assert any claim against any
Indemnifying Party with respect to any alleged Loss, cause of action or other
claim if such alleged Loss (a) is a possible or potential Loss, cause of
action or claim that the Indemnified Party believes may be asserted rather
than an actual Loss that has been paid or incurred by the Indemnified Party or
a Third Party Claim that has actually been asserted against the Indemnified
Party or (b) is with respect to which Indemnified Party has taken action (or
caused action to be taken) to accelerate the time period in which such matter
is asserted or payable.

(j) The Seller Group shall have no right of contribution or other recourse
against the members of the Company Group or their respective members,
directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, attorneys,
representatives, assigns or successors (other than a right of contribution
from the other members of the Seller Group, in their capacity as a member of
the Seller Group) for any Third-Party Claims asserted by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that the covenants and
agreements of the Company Group are solely for the benefit of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties.

 

10.6 _Release of Indemnity Escrow Amount_. Subject to any other limitations
set forth herein, any portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount remaining in the

released to the Earthbound Holders in accordance with their
Residual Percentages.

10.7 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except set
forth in _Schedule 4.28_ and as provided in Section 3.2 and Section 11.13,
from and after the Closing, (i) the indemnification rights set forth in this
_Article X_, all of which are subject to the terms, limitations, and
restrictions of this _Article X_, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
after Closing for any and all claims arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including claims based on
any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement under
this Agreement, (ii) recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any
claims against any Earthbound Holder, the Topco Seller, or otherwise, arising
out of or relating to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein, and (iii) on the date that the Indemnity Escrow
Amount is reduced to zero, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no further
rights to indemnification under this _Article X_.

 



66 (b) From and after Closing, no Person will have any remedy or recourse under
this Agreement except as provided in Section 10.7(a), whether in contract,
tort or otherwise, it being agreed that all of such other remedies and
recourse are expressly waived and released by the parties to the fullest
extent permitted by Law. The provisions of this Section 10.7 and the limited
remedies provided in Section 3.2, this Article X and Section 11.13 were

11.2 _Exhibits and Schedules_. For purposes of the representations and
warranties of the Earthbound Group contained herein and in the certificate
delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) hereto, disclosure in any
section of the Disclosure Schedule of any facts or circumstances shall be
deemed to be adequate response and disclosure of such facts or circumstances
with respect to all representations or warranties by such entities calling
for disclosure of such information, if it is reasonably apparent from a
disclosure item or the documentation referenced that another disclosure
section is also applicable. The inclusion of any matter, information or item
in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
admission of any Liability by the Earthbound Group to any third party or
otherwise imply, that any such matter, information or item is material or
creates a measure for materiality for the purposes of this Agreement.

11.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including
the Schedules and exhibits hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements,
Contracts, discussions, negotiations, undertakings and understandings (whether
written or oral) between the parties with respect to such subject matter
(other than the Confidentiality Agreement). This Agreement can be amended,

 



68  supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the
party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement,
including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, Liabilities
and obligations with respect to the Subject Transactions exclusively in
contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, and, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ , the
parties hereto expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are
entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ ,(a) the sole and
exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein,
made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement)
or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to the
Subject Transactions shall be those remedies available at Law or in equity
for breach of contract against the parties to this Agreement only (as such
contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the
express terms of this Agreement) and (b) the parties hereby agree that
neither party hereto shall have any remedies or causes of action (whether in
contract, tort or otherwise) for any statements, communications, disclosures,
failures to disclose, representations or warranties not explicitly set forth
in this Agreement.

11.4 _Severability_. Should any provision of this Agreement for any reason be
declared invalid or unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this Agreement,
which other provisions shall remain in full force and effect and the
application of such invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable
shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

 

11.5 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective heirs, executors, successors and permitted assigns, but
except as contemplated herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, directly or indirectly
by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto
and any attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void;
_provided_ , that Buyer may assign any of its rights (including Buyers rights
to seek indemnification hereunder) under this Agreement to any Affiliate of
Buyer or any Person to which Buyer has sold all or substantially all of its
assets or equity. Upon any such permitted assignment, the references in this
Agreement to Buyer shall also apply to any such assignee unless the context
otherwise requires.

11.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 11.6(b)_, this Agreement is not intended
and shall not be deemed to confer upon or give any Person except the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any remedy,
claim, Liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right under or by
reason of this Agreement.

 



69 (b) The provisions of _Sections 7.8_, _11.14_ , _11.15_ , and _11.16_
are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the persons
referenced therein, and each such person shall be a third party beneficiary
thereof.

 

11.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to Articles II and III, whether or not the
Subject Transactions are consummated, each party hereto shall pay all fees
and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement, and the consummation of the Subject Transactions. Each of Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Earthbound Group, on the other hand, shall be equally
liable for and shall pay one-half of all applicable filing fees and other
charges for the filings required under the HSR Act and any applicable non-US
antitrust Laws by all parties.

 

11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. The execution of this Agreement
and any agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendment hereto or thereto, by any of the parties hereto
or any other Person may be evidenced by way of a facsimile, portable document
format (.pdf) transmission or electronic production or reproduction,
photostatic or otherwise, of such partys or Persons signature, and such
portable document format (.pdf), or electronic production or reproduction
signature shall be deemed to constitute the original signature of such party
or Person. After the Closing, the parties hereto shall promptly exchange
original versions of this Agreement and all other agreements, certificates
and documents contemplated by this Agreement that were executed and exchanged
by electronic mail pursuant to this Section 11.8, but failure to do so shall
not affect the binding nature of the same.

 

11.9 _Interpretation_. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the
agreement of the parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to an Article, a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an
Article of, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it. The words "hereof", "hereto", "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted assigns
and successors. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to
the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine
as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any document
made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. No party,
or its counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of
construing the provisions of this Agreement, and all language in all parts of
this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with its fair meaning, and not
strictly for or against any party.

11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and its negotiation, execution,
performance or non-performance, interpretation, termination, construction and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based
upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation and
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this Agreement)
(each, a "Covered Matter"), shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of Laws that might
otherwise govern under any applicable conflict of laws principles.

 



70 11.11 _Forum; Service of Process_. All Proceedings arising out of or relating
to any Covered Matter shall be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State
of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court
within the State of Delaware) and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts in any such Proceeding
and irrevocably and unconditionally waive the defense of an inconvenient
forum, or lack of jurisdiction to the maintenance of any such Proceeding. The
consents to jurisdiction and venue set forth herein shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall
have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section 11.11 and
shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties
hereto. Each party hereto agrees that the service of process upon such party
in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to any Covered Matter shall be
effective if notice is given by overnight courier at the address set forth in
Section 11.1. Each of the parties also agrees that any final, non-appealable
judgment against a party in connection with any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to any Covered Matter shall be conclusive and binding on such party
and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction, either within or outside of the U.S. A certified or exemplified
copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and
amount of such award or judgment.

 

11.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF
THIS AGREEMENT. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF
ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT RELATE TO
THE COVERED MATTER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT
CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS, AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY CLAIMS.
THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO
ENTER INTO A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP, THAT EACH HAS ALREADY RELIED ON THE
WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, AND THAT EACH WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON
THE WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER
WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS OR HIS, AS
THE CASE MAY BE, LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER
IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN
WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS,
SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR
AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY
THE COURT.

11.13 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
parties hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Company Group, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
competent jurisdiction and that this shall include the right of the Company
Group to cause Buyer, 

 



71  on the one hand, and the right of Buyer to cause the Company Group and the
Sellers Representative, on the other hand, to fully perform the terms of this
Agreement to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to this Agreement and
applicable Law and to thereafter cause this Agreement and the Subject
Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions
thereto set forth in this Agreement. Such remedies shall, however, be
cumulative and not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies
which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the
parties hereto hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action for
specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. If any party brings
any action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof by any other party, the Outside Date shall be automatically
extended for so long as the party bringing such action is actively seeking a
court order for an injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that either Buyer or the Company Group (the "Non-Breaching
Party") brings an action for specific performance pursuant to this _Section
11.13_, and a court rules that the opposing party (the "Breaching Party")
breached this Agreement in connection with its failure to effect the Closing
in accordance with _Article II_, but such court declines to enforce
specifically the obligations of the Breaching Party to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Article II_, then, in addition to the right of the Non-
Breaching Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, such
party shall be entitled to pursue all applicable remedies at Law, including
seeking payment of monetary damages, and the Breaching Party shall pay the
Non-Breaching Partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with all actions to seek specific performance of the Breaching
Partys obligations pursuant to this Agreement and all actions to collect
such costs or expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
exercise of the Non-Breaching Partys right to seek specific performance
pursuant to this _Section 11.13_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
the Non-Breaching Partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1_ and/or pursue all applicable remedies at Law, including seeking
payment of monetary damages.

 

11.14 _Non-Recourse_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ , this Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement may only be brought against the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect
to the obligations expressly set forth herein with respect to such
party. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.28_ and to the extent a named party
to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of the obligations expressly
undertaken by such named party in this Agreement), no past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, Immediate Family member, agent, attorney, or other representative
of any party hereto, including the Sellers Representative or its partners
(collectively and solely in their capacities as such, the "Seller Related
Parties") shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of an
entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any obligations or
Liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith. In no event shall the Earthbound Group or any of its
Affiliates have any recourse against any former, current or future
stockholders, members, managers or Affiliates of Buyer or the Guarantor, or
any former, current or future officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives of any of the foregoing arising out of or based on the
termination of this Agreement or any breach hereof.

 



72 11.15 _Legal Representation_. Buyer and the Company Group hereby agree on
their own behalf and on behalf of their directors, members, partners,
officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns
(all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that Weil (or any successor) may
represent (a) any or all of the Earthbound Holders (the "Seller Group") or
any director, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller
Group, or (b) the Sellers Representative, in each case, in connection with
any dispute, litigation, claim, Proceeding or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such representation, the
"Post-Closing Representation") notwithstanding its representation of the
Company Group in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each of Buyer and the Company Group on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives
(and will not assert) any conflict of interest arising therefrom or relating
thereto in connection with the Post-Closing Representation, provided, however,
that the parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that
any attorney-client privilege attaching as a result of Weil representing the
Company Group and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will survive the Closing, and remain
in effect and be controlled by the Company Group and its Affiliates. Each of
Buyer and the Company Group, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between the Seller
Group and their counsel prior to the Closing, including Weil, made
substantially in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and performance under this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby that were
privileged communications between the Seller Group, the Company Group, and
such counsel prior to the Closing, shall continue from and after the Closing
to be privileged and that neither Buyer, the Company Group, nor any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or the Company Group
or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process
from the Seller Group, the Company Group or such counsel. From and after the
Closing, each of Buyer and the Company Group, on behalf of itself and the
Waiving Parties, will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to
any communication between Weil and the Company Group or any Person in the
Seller Group occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation.

11.16 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.28_
and for any rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, each of Buyer and the Company Group on behalf of itself and each
of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and each of its current and former
officers, directors, employees, partners, members, advisors, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Releasing Parties"), hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally releases and forever discharges the Earthbound Holders, their
Affiliates, each of their direct and indirect equity holders, and each of
their respective current and former officers, directors, employees, partners,
managers, advisors, successors and assigns (solely in their capacities as
such) (collectively, the "Seller Released Parties") of and from any and all
actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, executions, judgments, duties,
debts, dues, accounts, bonds, Contracts and covenants (whether express or
implied), and claims and demands whatsoever whether in Law or in equity,
including any rights to indemnification or reimbursement from any Seller
Released Parties whether pursuant to their constituent documents, Contracts or
otherwise (collectively, the "Buyer Released Claims") which the Buyer
Releasing Parties may have against each of the Seller Released Parties, now
or in the future, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing
relating to any of the Seller Released Parties occurring or arising on or
prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall operate
to release (i) any Buyer Released Claims that any Buyer Releasing Party may
have against any Seller Released Party arising under, or related to,
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Subject Transactions or (ii)
any person outside its capacity as a Seller Released Party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the releases set forth in the Letters of Transmittal.

 



73 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 4.28_
and for any rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, the Earthbound Holders and each of their direct and indirect
equity holders and each of its current and former officers, directors,
employees, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Releasing
Parties"), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever
discharges each of Buyer and the Earthbound Group, HM Earthbound LLC and their
Affiliates, each of their direct and indirect equity holders, and each of
their respective current and former officers, directors, employees, successors
and assigns (solely in their capacities as such) (collectively, the "Buyer
Released Parties") of and from any and all actions, causes of action, suits,
proceedings, executions, judgments, duties, debts, dues, accounts, bonds,
Contracts and covenants (whether express or implied), and claims and demands
whatsoever whether in Law or in equity, including any rights
to indemnification or reimbursement from any Buyer Released Parties whether
pursuant to their constituent documents, Contracts or otherwise (collectively,
the "Seller Released Claims") which the Seller Releasing Parties may have
against each of the Buyer Released Parties, now or in the future, in each
case solely in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to such
Earthbound Holders status as an equityholder of Topco or the Company Group,
respectively. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall operate to release (i)
any Seller Released Claims that any Seller Releasing Party may have against
any Buyer Released Party arising under, or related to, this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or the Subject Transactions or (ii) any person outside
its capacity as a Buyer Released Party.

 

11.17 _Guarantee_.

(a) Guarantor unconditionally guarantees the timely payment, in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, of any amounts due and payable by Buyer
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement when such amount shall become due and
payable by Buyer, including all amounts payable by Buyer upon the Closing
from and after the time that all of the conditions in this Agreement to
Buyers obligation to close have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied or waived at the
Closing), and Guarantor covenants and agrees that Guarantor shall either (i)
cause Buyer to pay such amounts as and when it shall become due and payable or
(ii) if not so paid by Buyer in accordance with the terms hereof, pay such
amounts as required to be paid by Buyer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement without any necessity of the Sellers Representative or any
Earthbound Holder being required to provide notice, demand or pursue
any recourse or remedies against Guarantor such that the payment of any
amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement by Buyer is a joint and
several obligation of Buyer and Guarantor.

 

(b) _Organization and Good Standing_. The Guarantor is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease, and
operate its properties, and to carry on its business and now conducted. The
Guarantor is duly qualified or authorized to do business and is in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership of its properties, requires such qualification or
authorization.

 

(c) _Authorization of Agreement_. The Guarantor has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Subject
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Subject Transactions have been duly authorized by all
requisite action on the part of the Guarantor. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Guarantor and (assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto)
this Agreement constitutes, will constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Guarantor, to the extent applicable to the Guarantor,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy,

 



74 insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors
rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity, including principles of commercial reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at Law or in equity).

 

(d) _Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties._

 

(i) Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby nor
compliance by the Guarantor with any of the provisions hereof that are
applicable to the Guarantor will, in any material respect, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination or
cancellation under, any provision of (i) the organizational documents of the
Guarantor; (ii) any material Contract or material Permit to which the
Guarantor is a party or by which any of the material properties or assets of
the Guarantor are bound; (iii) any material Order of any Governmental Entity
applicable to the Guarantor, or by which any of the material properties or
assets of the Guarantor are bound; or (iv) any applicable Law.

 

(ii) No material consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization of,
or declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person or Governmental
Entity is required on the part of the Guarantor in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the
