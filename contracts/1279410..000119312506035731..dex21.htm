11.1(k), each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.1(b) or Company Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into and

Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio ("Parent Shares"). At the
Effective Time, all of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to
exist, and each certificate previously representing any such Company Shares

owned directly or indirectly by the Parent or any Subsidiary of the Company
or Parent (other than Company Shares held in trust or otherwise for the
benefit of a third party or as pledgee) shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.



(c) _Company Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, any holder of Company Shares who shall be
entitled to be paid the "fair market value" of such holders
Company Perfected Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 1300 of the CGCL,
shall only be entitled to receive such payment provided for in Section 1300 of
the CGCL unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or
withdrawn or lost such holders rights under Section 1300 of the CGCL.



 

3 (d) _Parent Capital Stock_. Upon consummation of the Holding Company Merger,
each outstanding share of Parent capital stock shall remain an outstanding
share of Parent capital stock and shall not be converted or otherwise affected
by the Holding Company Merger, except as set forth in Section 2.6, and shall
be deemed to represent one outstanding share of the Surviving Corporation.



_Section 2.2. __Change in Parent Common Stock_. If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares of Parent Common Stock by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,

Ratio, the Parent Average Price and the Starting Price shall be
correspondingly and appropriately adjusted to reflect such event.



_Section 2.3. __Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision
hereof, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued to holders
of Company Shares in the Holding Company Merger. In lieu thereof, each such
holder entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive,
at the time of surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
holders Company Shares, an amount in cash equal to the Parent Average
Price multiplied by the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder otherwise would be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights, interest on the value of, or any other rights in
respect of a fractional share. Fractional shares shall be determined on an
aggregate basis for each Company shareholder and not on a per share or per
certificate basis.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a
bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange
Agent") in trust for the benefit of holders of the Company Shares (i) such
certificates of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent Stock Certificates")
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) sufficient cash to make all
cash payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3. Parent
shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent to effect the foregoing
exchange of Parent Common Stock for Company Shares, which agreement shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_.



(i) The Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent, promptly after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days following
the Effective Time), to mail to each holder of record of certificates of
Company Common Stock Certificates ("Company Common Stock Certificates") that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(a), (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Company Common Stock
Certificates shall pass only upon delivery of the Company Stock Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (B)
instructions for completion and use in effecting the surrender of the Company
Common Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Company Common Stock Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent (or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and
indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be reasonably required
by Parent as set forth in subsection (g) hereto), together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed in accordance with the instructions contained 



 

4 therein, the holder of such Company Common Stock Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to this Article II and the Company Common Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee of the record holder of such Company Shares if the Company Common
Stock Certificate representing such Company Shares is presented to
the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4, each
Company Common Stock Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.4.



(c) _Return of Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand by
Parent to the Exchange Agent, and any holders of Company Shares who have
not theretofore surrendered their Company Common Stock Certificates, or any
of them, as provided in this Section 2.4, shall thereafter look only to Parent
for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled, without any interest
thereon. 



(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares_.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no dividends or other
distributions in respect of Parent Shares with a record date on or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to any person holding a Company Common
Stock Certificate until such Company Common Stock Certificate has been
surrendered for exchange as provided for in this Section 2.4. Subject to
applicable Laws and the immediately preceding sentence, following surrender of
any such Company Common Stock Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder
of the Parent Stock Certificate issued in exchange therefor, if any, without
interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore
payable with respect to the Parent Shares represented thereby, as well as any
dividends with respect to the Company Shares represented by the surrendered
Company Common Stock Certificate declared prior to the Effective Time but
theretofore unpaid.



(e) _Transfers_. On or after the Effective Time, holders of Company Common
Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of the
Company, other than to receive the consideration provided for under this
Article II. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers of Company
Shares on the stock transfer books of the Company.



(f) _No Liability_. Neither the Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any
holder of Company Shares for any Merger Consideration deposited with the
Exchange Agent which is properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Common Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Company Common Stock Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by
such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Common Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to
which the holders thereof are entitled, without any interest thereon.



 

5 (h) _Withholding_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Shares such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Shares in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent or the Exchange Agent.



_Section 2.5. _ _Effect of Holding Company Merger on Company Options and
Company Warrants_. The outstanding options or other rights to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Options") and the
outstanding Company Warrants shall be treated as follows in connection with
the Holding Company Merger:



(a) The Company shall give all holders of Company Options timely notice of the
pending Holding Company Merger in accordance with the provisions of the
Company Option Plan. In accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plan,
each outstanding Company Option shall become immediately exercisable, whether
or not vested under the terms of the Company Option Plan. Each holder of a
Company Option will then have the right to exercise such Company Option for
Company Common Stock, and, upon effectiveness of the Holding Company Merger,
receive the consideration set forth in Section 2.1. In order to determine the
value of shares of Company Common Stock used to pay the exercise price for
outstanding Company Options, the Company shall take into account the value of
Parent Common Stock being issued in exchange for Company Common Stock in the
Holding Company Merger. Unless exercised or canceled prior to the Effective
Time, all Company Options which have not been exercised prior to the
Effective Time of the Holding Company Merger shall terminate in accordance
with the terms of the Company Option Plan without any additional consideration
therefor.



(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant which is then
outstanding shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a warrant to purchase
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and other securities and property
(including cash) which each holder would have owned or would have been
entitled to receive after the occurrence of the Holding Company Merger had
they exercised the Company Warrant for Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time of the Holding Company Merger, and Parent shall assume
each Company Warrant, in accordance with the terms of the Company Warrant and
the Warrant Agreement dated April 19, 2002. As assumed, the Warrant exercise
price shall also be adjusted by dividing the as adjusted per share exercise
price under each such Company Warrant by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the
nearest whole cent, subject to any additional adjustments required by Section
11.1(k). Parent and Company agree to take all necessary steps to effect
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5(b), including without limitation
the mailing by Parent by first class, U.S. mail, postage prepaid, to each
holder of a Company Warrant of a written instrument setting forth Parents
agreement to assume such Company Warrants.



_Section 2.6. _ _Parent Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any holder of Parent Common Stock who
shall be entitled to be paid the "fair market value" of such holders Parent
Perfected Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 1300 of the CGCL, shall
only be entitled to receive such payment provided for in Section 1300 of the
CGCL unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or withdrawn or
lost such holders rights under Section 1300 of the CGCL.



 

6 _Section 2.7. __Computation and Confirmation of Certain Items_. The Aggregate
Merger Consideration, Per Share Price and Exchange Ratio shall be calculated
by Parent prior to the Effective Time of the Holding Company Merger and shall
be set forth in a certificate (the "Merger Certificate") executed by an
authorized executive officer of Parent and furnished to the Company prior to
the Closing Date showing the manner of calculation in reasonable detail.

Agreement of Bank Merger by the Company Bank, do not, and the performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby

Company Bank, as the case may be, will not, (A) conflict with or violate any
provision of the Company Articles or Company Bylaws or any
equivalent organizational documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) conflict
with or violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound or affected (assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and

notifications described in Section 3.6(b) have been made and any waiting
periods thereunder have terminated or expired), or (C) require any consent or

any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Company Material Contract (as
defined in Section 3.14 herein), Company Permits or other material instruments
or obligations.



(b) (i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Holding Company Merger by the Company and (ii) the execution and delivery
of the Agreement of Bank Merger and the consummation of the Bank Merger by the

obligations under the Agreement of Bank Merger will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except as set forth in Section 3.6(b) of the Company
Confidential Disclosure Schedule. The Company has no knowledge of any reason
why all Government Approvals required for consummation of the Holding Company
Merger and the Bank Merger will not be obtained on a timely basis.



_Section 3.7. __Permits; Compliance With Law_.



(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in possession of all material
authorizations, licenses, permits, certificates, approvals and clearances of
any Governmental Entity necessary for it to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its business substantially in the manner as it is
being conducted (the "Company Permits"), and all such Company Permits are
valid, and in full force and effect and, to the Companys knowledge, no
suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened.



 

10 (b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in default or violation
of, (i) any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which any material property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is bound or affected or (ii) any Company Permits.



(c) The Company Bank received a rating of "Satisfactory" in its most recent
examination for compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as
amended ("Community Reinvestment Act").



_Section 3.8. __SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Regulatory Reports_.



(a) The Company has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses,
forms, reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, since January 1, 2003 (collectively, the "Company SEC Filings"). None
of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the
SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. Each Company SEC Filing (i) as of the time
it was filed, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be and (ii) did not, at
the time it was filed (or if subsequently amended or superseded by a Company
SEC Filing made on or prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of
such subsequent filing, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.



(b) The Companys consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes and schedules thereto) contained in the Company SEC Filings, were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the
case of interim consolidated financial statements, where information and
footnotes contained in such financial statements are not required to be in
compliance with GAAP), and in each case such consolidated financial statements
fairly presented in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and the
consolidated Subsidiaries of the Company as of the respective dates thereof
and for the respective periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments which did not and which
are not expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to the Company).



(c) Except as and to the extent adequately provided for, in the aggregate,
on the consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 (the "Company Balance Sheet"), neither
the Company nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on a balance sheet or in
notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for liabilities or
obligations (i) incurred in the ordinary course of business since September
30, 2005 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Company, or (ii) incurred or provided for
in, or as contemplated by, this Agreement. 



(d) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that the Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2003
was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or furnished by the
Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated under
such act or the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and at
the time of filing or submission of each such certification,
such certification (i) was true and accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act in all material respects, (ii) did not contain any qualifications or
exceptions to the



 

11 matters certified therein, except as otherwise permitted under the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, and (iii) has not been
modified or withdrawn. Neither the Company nor any of its officers has
received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, content, form or manner of filing or furnishing of
such certifications. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) effectively
enable the Company to comply with, and the appropriate officers of
the Company to make all certifications required under, the provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act pertaining to disclosure controls and procedures. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that material information, relating to the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be included in any of the Company SEC
Filings, were made known to Company management, including its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, respectively, on a timely basis. Neither
the Company, nor any of its officers, has received notice from any
Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing or submission of such certifications. The Company
knows of no reason why the Companys outside auditors, chief executive officer
and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when
next due.



(e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed all material documents
and reports relating to each of the Company and its Subsidiaries required to
be filed with the FRB, the FDIC, the DFI, or any other Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over its business or any of its assets or properties (each
a "Regulatory Authority" and collectively, the "Regulatory Authorities"). All
such reports conform in all material respects with the requirements
promulgated by such Regulatory Authorities.



(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals
and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. Neither the
Company nor, to the Companys knowledge, the Companys independent auditors or
any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries has identified or been made
aware of (i) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Companys
or any Subsidiarys management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal controls used or utilized
by the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) any claim or allegation regarding
any of the foregoing.



_Section 3.9. __Regulatory Matters_. Except as may otherwise be set forth in
Section 3.9 of the Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is, directly or indirectly, party or
subject to any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding or
similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
supervisory letter from, any Regulatory Authority or (ii) has been advised
by, or has any knowledge of facts which are reasonably expected to give rise
to an advisory notice by, any Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory
Authority is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering
the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any order, decree, agreement,
memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar
submission. Except as set forth on Section 3.9 of the Company Confidential
Disclosure Schedule, all compliance or corrective action relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries required by Regulatory Authorities having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been taken. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has paid all assessments made or imposed
by and required to have been heretofore paid to any Regulatory Authority.



 

12 _Section 3.10. __Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.



(a) Since December 31, 2005, except as specifically contemplated by, or as
disclosed in, this Agreement, the Company SEC Filings or Section 3.10 of the
Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has conducted its business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and (ii) has not taken any action that would have been
prohibited by Section 6.1 if taken after the date of this Agreement, except
with respect to Section 6.1(o) the threshold shall be $2,000,000 rather than
$1,000,000.



(b) Since December 31, 2005, except as set forth in Section 3.10 of the
Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule, there has not been any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or an event or development that is
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company.



_Section 3.11. __Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Section 3.11(a) of the Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule lists, as

person, (ii) none of the Company Benefit Plans is a "multiemployer plan" as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA ("Multiemployer Plan"); (iii)
to the Companys knowledge, there has been no "prohibited transaction," as
such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
("Prohibited Transaction") with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, which
could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) to the Companys knowledge,
all Company Benefit Plans are in material compliance with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes (including ERISA and the Code), orders, or
governmental rules and regulations currently in effect with respect thereto
(including all applicable requirements for notification to participants or
the Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
"PBGC"), Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or Secretary of the Treasury);
(v) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have performed their respective
obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in material
default under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default

each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code

13 properly accrued and reflected in the Companys most recent financial
statements contained in the Companys SEC Filings; (ix) with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30-day notice requirement has
been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) nor any event
described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA has occurred; and (x) neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, nor reasonably expects to
incur, any material liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than liability
for premium payments to the PBGC arising in the ordinary course).



(c) Except as set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Confidential
Disclosure Schedule, no amount that could be received (whether in cash
or property or the vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by any employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan could be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

the Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan

continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations thereunder and

Confidential Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has (i) granted to any person an interest in a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code)
which interest has been or, upon the lapse of a substantial risk of
forfeiture with respect to such interest, will be subject to tax imposed by
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code or (ii) modified the terms of
any nonqualified deferred compensation plan in a manner that could cause an
interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the tax
imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code.



_Section 3.12. __Labor and Other Employment Matters_.



(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws respecting labor, employment, fair

bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is being negotiated by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no labor dispute, strike,
slowdown or work stoppage against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

knowledge, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, in any
material



 

14 respect, in violation of any term of any employment contract, non-disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former

proprietary information of others.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) all Company Severance Arrangements,
and (iii) all Company Change in Control Arrangements. Except as set forth in
Section 3.12(b) of the Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Holding
Company Merger or the Bank Merger by the Company will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, such as termination of employment) (A)
result in any payment (including, without limitation, severance, unemployment
compensation, parachute or otherwise) becoming due to any director, officer,
employee or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) increase any benefits otherwise
payable or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of
any material benefits, under or pursuant to any such employment agreements or
Company Severance or Change in Control Arrangements. No individual who is a
party to any such employment agreement or a party to or covered by any such
Company Severance or Change in Control Arrangements has terminated his or
her employment or has been terminated, nor, to the Companys knowledge, has

severance obligation on the part of the Company under any such agreement or
arrangement.

its Subsidiaries to offer products or services of any other person on a
priority or exclusive basis, or (g) gives rise to any benefits to any other
person as a result of the consummation of the Holding Company Merger or the
Bank Merger, (collectively, "Company Material Contracts"). Each Company
Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company or the Subsidiary (as
the case may be) that is a party thereto and, to the Companys knowledge, each
other party thereto, and is in full force and effect, and the Company or its
Subsidiary that is a party thereto has

hereof under each such Company Material Contract and, to the Companys
knowledge, each other party to each Company Material Contract has in all
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it under such
Company Material Contract, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. None of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any
violation or default under (or any condition which with the passage of time or
the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or default under) any
Company Material Contract.

Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth
in Section 3.15 of the Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule, (a) there are

circumstances, or facts that are reasonably expected to (i) interfere with or
prevent continued compliance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
Environmental Laws and the requirements of Environmental Permits, (ii) give
rise to any liability or other obligation under any Environmental Laws,

based on or related to any Environmental Law.



 

16 _Section 3.17. __Intellectual Property_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries owns or has a valid license to use all Company Intellectual

jurisdictions in which such Tax Returns are required to be filed (after giving

thereof for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed or for which Taxes are
not yet due and owing; and (iii) no agreement, waiver or other document or
arrangement extending or having the effect of extending the period for

examinations by any Tax authority or other Governmental Entity of the Tax
Returns of or covering or including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
have been fully paid. No requests by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for a ruling or a determination letter are pending with any Tax authority
or other Governmental Entity; and no issue has been raised in writing by any

attributable to a transaction, ( _e.g._ an installment sale) occurring in, or
a change in accounting method made for a taxable period ending on or before
December 31, 2005, that resulted in a deferred reporting of income from such
transaction or from such change in accounting method (other than a deferred
inter-company transaction).



(i) All material amounts have been properly computed under the terms of
any existing Tax sharing agreements that any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to; all payments due any Company and its Subsidiary

Records_. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.2 of the Parent Confidential
Disclosure Schedules, the copies of Parents Articles of Incorporation, as

affecting creditors rights, to general equitable principles (regardless of

Merger and the Bank Merger, will not be obtained on a timely basis.

Parent SEC Filings filed prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth

suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened.



(b) None of the Parent or any of its Significant Subsidiaries is in
default or violation of, (i) any Law applicable to Parent or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or
assets is bound or affected or (ii) any Parent Permits.



(c) The Parent Bank received a rating of "Satisfactory" in its most recent
examination for compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.



_Section 4.9. __SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Regulatory Reports_.



(a) Parent has timely filed all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,
reports, definitive proxy statements, schedules and documents required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, since August 16, 2004 (collectively, the "Parent SEC Filings"). None of
Parents Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the
SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. Each Parent SEC Filing (i) as of the time
it was filed, complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and



 

24 (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if subsequently amended or
superseded by an Parent SEC Filing made on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent filing), contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(b) The Parents consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes and schedules thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Filings were
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the
case of interim consolidated financial statements, where information and
footnotes contained in such financial statements are not required to be
in compliance with GAAP), and in each case such consolidated financial
statements fairly presented or will fairly present, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
Parent and the consolidated Subsidiaries of Parent as of the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods covered thereby (subject, in the case
of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments which did not and
which are not expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Parent).



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 (the "Parent
Balance Sheet"), neither Parent nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected on a balance
sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied, except for liabilities or obligations (i) incurred in the ordinary
course of business since September 30, 2005 that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or (ii)
incurred or provided for in, or as contemplated by, this Agreement.



(d) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that Parent has filed with or furnished to the SEC since August 16, 2004 was
accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or furnished by
Parents chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification (i) was true and accurate and complied with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in all material respects, (ii) did not contain any
qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein, except as
otherwise permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (iii) has not been
modified or withdrawn. Neither Parent nor any of its officers has received
notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or challenging the accuracy,
completeness, content, form or manner of filing or furnishing of such
certifications. Parents disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable
Parent to comply with, and the appropriate officers of Parent to make all
certifications required under, the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
pertaining to disclosure controls and procedures. Parents disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material
information, relating to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to
be included in any of the Parent SEC Filings, were made known to Parent
management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, respectively, on a timely basis. Neither Parent, nor any of its
officers, has received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certifications. Parent knows of no reason why Parents outside
auditors, chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able
to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due.



 

25 (e) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has filed all material documents and
reports relating to each of Parent and its Subsidiaries required to be filed
with Regulatory Authorities. All such reports conform in all material respects
with the requirements promulgated by such Regulatory Authorities.



(f) The Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide assurance that (i) transaction are
executed in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations,
(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability,
(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization and (iv) the recorded accountability for
assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. Neither the
Parent nor, to the Parents knowledge, the Parents independent auditors or
any employee of the Parent or its Subsidiaries has identified or been made
aware of (A) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves the Parents or
any Subsidiarys management or other employees who have a role in the
preparation of financial statements or the internal controls used or utilized
by the Parent or its Subsidiaries or (B) any claim or allegation regarding any
of the foregoing.



_Section 4.10. __Regulatory Matters_. Except as may otherwise be set forth in
Section 4.10 of the Parent Confidential Disclosure Schedule, neither the
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is, directly or indirectly, party or
subject to any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding or
similar arrangement with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
supervisory letter from, any Regulatory Authority or (ii) has been advised by,
or has any knowledge of facts which are reasonably expected to give rise to an
advisory notice by, any Regulatory Authority that such Regulatory Authority
is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness
of issuing or requesting) any order, decree, agreement, memorandum of
understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.
Except as set forth on Section 4.10 of the Parent Confidential Disclosure
Schedule, all compliance or corrective action relating to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries required by Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has been taken. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries has paid all assessments made or imposed by and required to have
been heretofore paid to any Regulatory Authority.

2005, except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the Parent Confidential
Disclosure Schedule, (i) Parent and its Significant Subsidiaries have
conducted their business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and (ii) there has not been any Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Parent or an event or development that would, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries.



_Section 4.12. __Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Section 4.12(a) of the Parent Confidential Disclosure Schedule lists as
of the date hereof all Parent Benefit Plans, excluding agreements with former
employees under which the Company has no remaining obligations. There have

Benefit Plan, (ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 series, with
accompanying schedules and attachments, filed with respect to each Parent
Benefit Plan required to make such a filing, and (iii) the most recent

26 (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.12(b) of the Parent Confidential

Treasury), and Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have performed their
respective obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in
default under or violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or

initiate, solicit or take any other action designed to facilitate an

their respective Representatives, receives a written Acquisition Proposal from
any person, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of Section
6.3(a) and appears, on its face to be bona fide, and the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor (which may be its existing Financial Advisor or any
affiliate thereof), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then, subject to its
compliance with this Section 6.3 and after giving notice to Parent, the
Company or its Representatives may (i) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the person who has made such Acquisition Proposal, or any of its

or amend, or propose to withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation or resolve to do so; provided,

committee thereof, may withdraw, or modify or amend in a manner adverse
to the Parent, the Company Board Recommendation and if it takes such action,
it also may terminate its efforts to hold, and cancel or postpone, the Company
Shareholders Meeting, in the event that the Company receives a Superior
Proposal and the Company Board, or any committee thereof, determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel (which may be its
current outside legal counsel), that failure to take such actions could result
in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary obligations under Governing Law.



(d) In addition to the obligations set forth in Sections 6.3(a) and 6.3(b),
the Company shall (i) advise Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours) following the commencement of any discussions or
negotiations with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and the material terms
and conditions that are the subject of such discussions or negotiations and
(ii) keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details
(including material amendments) with respect to the information previously
provided, pursuant to this Section 6.3(d), by the Company in connection with

Agreement and prior to the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting,

Superior Proposal, but only if:

covenants contained in Section 6.3 hereof;



(ii) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have first
provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to terminate this
Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal,
which notice shall attach the most current version of any written agreement
relating to the transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal; and



(iii) Parent does not make, within five (5) Business Days after the receipt
of the notice referred to in clause (ii) of this Section 6.3(e), a binding,
written and complete (including any schedules or exhibits) proposal that the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor (which may be its current Financial
Advisor or any affiliate thereof), is more favorable to the shareholders of
the Company as such Superior Proposal and which, by its terms, may be
accepted at any time within five (5) Business Days following such five (5)
Business Day period.



(f) In the event of any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
to Section 6.3(e), the Company shall pay, as a condition to such termination,
the termination fee to Parent pursuant to Section 11.2(b) concurrently with
such termination.



(g) The Company shall be permitted to comply with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or
Item 1012 of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that compliance with such rules and items will in no way limit or
modify the effect of such action pursuant to such rules and items would
otherwise have under this Agreement.



(h) If the Company Board or any committee thereof takes, agrees or
resolves to take any action permitted by this Section 6.3 without the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries Representatives
breaching any of the terms of this Section 6.3, including, but not limited to
any of the actions set forth in Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.3(e) above, such
action shall not, in any way, constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.



_Section 6.4. __Accounting_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with GAAP, the rules
and regulations of the SEC, and applicable Law, modify or change its loan,
accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be
applied on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent; provided, however,
that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(e); and further provided, that in
any event, no accrual or reserve made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall constitute or be deemed to be
a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or condition or other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach, violation or
failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any such adjustments
shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished
financial statements or information and shall not be construed as concurrence
of the Company or its subsidiaries with any such adjustments.



  

41 _Section 6.5. __Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior

and supervision over its respective operations.

commercially reasonable best efforts to identify those persons who may be
deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145

to have executed and delivered to Parent nonsolicitation agreements in the
form of _Exhibit E-2,_ in each case simultaneously with the execution of
this Agreement.

or take such other actions with respect to the Company Benefits Plans as are

transaction. At or prior to the Effective Time of the Holding Company Merger

final bills for all material fees and expenses to the Company for services

submitted to Parent a final calculation of such fees and expenses, and shall
accrue and pay the amount of such fees and expenses as calculated above, after
a copy of all such bills and calculation of such fees and expenses has been

any valid invoice received after the Effective Time of the Holding Company
Merger.

of the Code. The form and substance of such amendments shall be subject to
the review and reasonable approval of Parent. Following the Closing, Parent
will amend and restate the SERPs as necessary to bring them into compliance
with Section 409A of the Code for regulatory guidance issued after the
Closing.



(e) Prior to the Closing, Parent will conduct interviews with all Company
employees in order to determine the appropriate staffing levels of the

_Section 7.5. __Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time until five (5) years thereafter, Parent
(the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless (and also shall
advance expenses as and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted by a
California company under California Law), each person who now is or prior to
the date hereof has been, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Indemnified Persons"), against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including counsel fees and expenses), settlement, payments or liabilities
arising out of or in connection with any claim, demand, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that such person is or was an officer or director
of the Company or any Subsidiary or as a result of serving at the request of
the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, whether or not
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent which such Indemnified Parties are
entitled under the Company or any Subsidiary certificate of incorporation,
bylaws or equivalent organizational documents, as applicable, or any
agreement, arrangement or understanding set forth in Section 7.5 of the
Company Confidential Disclosure Schedule and for which the right to
indemnification has been provided by the Company in accordance with applicable
Law ("Indemnified Liabilities"). Nothing contained herein shall make Parent or
the Company an insurer, a co-insurer or an excess insurer in respect of any
insurance policies which may provide coverage for Indemnified Liabilities, nor
shall this Section 7.5 relieve the obligations of any insurer in respect
thereto. The parties hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited
by applicable Law, that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.5
shall apply without limitation to negligent acts or omissions by an
Indemnified Person. Each Indemnified Person (and each of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators) is an intended third party beneficiary of this
Section 7.5, each of whom may, individually or jointly, specifically enforce
its terms against Parent. This Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of
the Holding Company Merger at the Effective Time and shall be binding not
only on Parent but also on all of its successors and assigns. This Section 7.5
shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified
Person may have under any agreement with the Company or under the Company
Articles or Company Bylaws as presently in effect, or otherwise.



 

45 (b) From and after the Effective Time until five (5) years thereafter, Parent
shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and its
directors and officers, copies of which have been furnished to Parent, and any
indemnification provisions under the Company Articles or Company Bylaws as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any Indemnified Person wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 7.5, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Person if
such failure does not actually prejudice the Indemnifying Party. In the event
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Persons
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may
retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party,
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements therefor are
received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Persons (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii)
the Indemnified Person will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Person in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws and
regulations.



(c) Parent shall maintain in effect, for six (6) consecutive years commencing
on and continuing after the Effective Time, the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries on the date hereof (provided that Parent may substitute thereof
policies with reputable and financially sound carriers having at least the
same coverage and amounts thereof and containing material terms and conditions
that are no less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company
insured under such policies) for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be
required to pay in excess of 250% of the annual premium most recently paid by
the Company or any Subsidiary for such coverage; _provided further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such coverage is not available (or
is only available for an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium most
recently paid by the Company for such coverage), Parent shall nevertheless use
reasonable best efforts to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such
250% amount.



(d) In the event Parent (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.



(e) The obligations of Parent under this Section 7.5 shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to, nor shall Parent take any other action
that would, adversely affect or otherwise diminish the rights of any
indemnitee to whom this Section 7.5 applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee.



 

46 _Section 7.6. __Severance Agreements_. As of the Effective Time, and as
mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent, and notwithstanding any
termination of Company Benefit Plans set forth in Section 7.4(a), either
Company shall fulfill all of its obligations under the Severance Arrangements
and Change in Control Arrangements or Parent shall assume all of the
obligations of the Company under the Severance Arrangements and Change in
Control Arrangements identified in Section 7.6 of the Company Confidential
Disclosure Schedules, in accordance with their respective terms (even if the
terms thereof provide for performance thereof at a later date), including any
and all payment obligations thereunder and Parent shall not challenge the
enforceability or seek to invalidate or make unenforceable any of such
Agreements.

event that entitled such party (the "Terminating "Party") to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(f) or 11.1(g), as the case may be, was a
willful and material breach by the other party (a "Breaching Party") of any
representation, warranty or covenant of such Breaching Party set forth in this
Agreement, the Terminating Party shall have all rights and remedies available
to it under this Agreement or at law to recover from the Breaching Party all
damages, losses, costs and expenses that the Terminating Party incurs by
reason of such willful and material breach by the Breaching Party and the
