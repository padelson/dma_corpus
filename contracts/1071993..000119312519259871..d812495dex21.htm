(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5(f)_, to the extent that there is
an objection to the assignment and assumption of any Transferred Contract
outstanding at the Closing Date or any Necessary Consent that is required to
assume and assign to Buyer any Transferred Contract is not obtained by the
Closing Date, each Seller shall, with respect to each such Seller Contract,
from and after the Closing and until the earliest to occur of (i) the date on
which such objection is resolved or such applicable Necessary Consent is
obtained, and (ii) the date on which such Seller Contract is deemed rejected
under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, use commercially reasonable efforts
during the term of such Seller Contract to (A) provide to Buyer the benefits
under such Seller Contract, (B) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangement, including holding such Seller Contract in trust for Buyer pending
resolution of such objection or receipt of the Necessary Consent, designed to
provide such benefits to Buyer, and (C) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce for the account of Buyer any rights of such Seller under
such Seller Contract, including the right to elect to terminate such Seller
Contract in accordance with the terms thereof upon the written direction of
Buyer. Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers in order to enable
Sellers to provide to Buyer the benefits contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
1.5(e)_.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Seller Contract shall not be a
Transferred Contract hereunder and shall not be assigned to, or assumed
by, Buyer to the extent that such Seller Contract (i) is deemed rejected
under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or (ii) is the subject of an
objection to assignment or assumption or requires a Necessary Consent of any
Governmental Entity or other third party (other than, and in addition to,
that of the Bankruptcy Court) in order to permit the assumption and assignment
by the applicable Seller to Buyer of such Seller Contract pursuant to Section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and such objection has not been resolved or such
Necessary Consent has not been obtained prior to the 60th day following the
Closing (as such 60-day period may be extended by mutual agreement of
Buyer and Sellers).

(g) At any time prior to the Designation Deadline, Buyer shall have the right,
which may be exercised in Buyers sole discretion, to provide written notice
to Sellers (each such notice, a "Contract Notice") of Buyers election to
designate any executory Seller Contract (including any Seller Contract that
was included on _Schedule 1.1(n)_  immediately before such designation) (1)
as an Excluded Contract, and upon such designation such Seller Contract shall
constitute an Excluded Contract and, if applicable, shall cease to constitute
a Transferred Contract or (2) to the extent not already rejected, as a
Transferred Contract and upon such designation such Seller Contract shall
constitute a Transferred Contract and shall cease to constitute an Excluded
Contract. If, at any time after the Designation Deadline, the Cure Costs
fixed by the Bankruptcy Court for any Transferred Contract are (i) greater
than the amount set forth on the initial schedule of Cure Costs filed by
Sellers with the Bankruptcy Court prior to the Designation Deadline and (ii)
are not consented to by Buyer, then Buyer shall be permitted, no later than
two (2) Business Days after entry of an order by the Bankruptcy Court setting
such Cure Costs, to provide Sellers with a Contract Notice of Buyers election
to revoke its designation of any such Seller Contract as a Transferred
Contract and thereupon such Seller Contract shall be deemed to be an Excluded
Contract for all purposes of this Agreement. The Parties shall amend _Schedule
1.1(n)_ and _Schedule 3.6_ to reflect modifications made pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(g)_.

Section 1.6 _Non-Assignment of Assets_. 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign or transfer and
will not effect the assignment or transfer of any Transferred Asset (including
any Transferred Contract) if (i)(A) prohibited by applicable Law, (B) an
attempted assignment or transfer thereof would reasonably likely to subject
Buyer, its Affiliates or any of its or their respective Representatives to
civil or criminal Liability or (C) an attempted assignment or transfer
thereof, without the approval, authorization or consent of, or granting or
issuance of any license or permit by, any third party thereto (each such
action, a " _Necessary Consent_ "), would constitute a breach, default or
violation thereof or of any Law or Order or in any way adversely affect the
rights of Buyer thereunder or (ii) the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an
Order approving such assignment or transfer. In such event, such assignment or
transfer is subject to such Necessary Consent being obtained and Sellers and
Buyer will use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary
Consents with respect to any such Transferred Asset (including any Transferred
Contract) or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the
assignment or transfer thereof to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers will not be obligated to pay any
consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is
requested or to initiate any litigation or legal proceedings to obtain
any such consent or approval. If such Necessary Consent is not obtained, or
if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof would give rise to any of the
circumstances described in _clauses_ __ _ (i)_ or _(ii)_ of the
first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, be ineffective or would
adversely affect the rights of Buyer to such Transferred Asset following the
Closing, (x) Sellers and Buyer will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, (1) use commercially reasonable efforts (including cooperating
with one another to obtain such Necessary Consents, to the extent feasible) as
may be necessary so that Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, (2) complete any
such assignments or transfers as soon as reasonably practicable and (3) upon
receipt of any applicable Necessary Consents, to transfer or assign the
applicable Transferred Asset to Buyer, and (y) Sellers will, and will cause
their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer in good faith without
further consideration in any arrangement reasonably acceptable to Buyer and
Sellers intended to provide Buyer with the benefit of any such Transferred
Assets.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_, if at any time after the Closing (i)
Buyer or its designee holds any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or
(ii) any Seller holds any Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, Buyer or
the applicable Seller will promptly transfer (or cause to be transferred) such
assets or assume (or cause to be assumed) such Liabilities to or from (as the
case may be) the other Party. Prior to any such transfer, the Party receiving
or possessing any such asset will hold it in trust for such other Party.

 

Section 1.7 _Further Conveyances and Assurances_. From time to time following
the Closing, Sellers and Buyer will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances,
notices, assumptions, assignments, releases and other instruments, and will
take such further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate
to assure fully to Buyer and its successors or assigns, all of the
properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Buyer under this Agreement and to assure
fully to each Seller and its Affiliates and their respective successors and
assigns, the assumption of the Liabilities and obligations intended to be

infiltration of any Well) and the depreciation of personal property due to
ordinary wear and tear, in each case, with respect to the Transferred Assets.

 



11

    

(b) If, during the period from the Effective Time through the Closing, any
portion of the Transferred Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or
is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, Buyer shall
nevertheless be required to consummate the Closing, and Sellers shall elect
(in their sole discretion) by written notice to Buyer prior to Closing either
(i) to cause the Transferred Assets affected by such casualty or taking to be
repaired or restored to at least its condition prior to such casualty or
taking, at Sellers sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which
work may extend after the Closing Date) or (ii) at Closing, to pay to Buyer
all sums paid or payable to Sellers by third parties by reason of such
casualty or taking insofar as with respect to the Transferred Assets and
shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of
Sellers right, title and interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards
and other rights against third Persons arising out of such casualty or
taking insofar as with respect to the Transferred Assets; _provided_ , _
however_, that in the case of _clause (i)_ above, Sellers shall retain all
rights to insurance, condemnation awards and other claims against third
Persons with respect to the casualty or taking except to the extent the
Parties otherwise agree in writing; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case
of _clause (ii)_ above, Sellers shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall
assign to Sellers) all rights, title, interests and claims against third
parties for the recovery of Sellers costs and expenses incurred prior to the
Closing Date in pursuing any such insurance claims or other rights against
third Persons or in defending or asserting rights in such condemnation or
eminent domain action with respect to the Transferred Assets.

(c) If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Transferred Asset or portion thereof
after the date of this Agreement, but no taking of such Transferred Asset or
portion thereof occurs prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall nevertheless be
required to consummate the Closing and Sellers, at Closing, shall assign,
transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right,
title and interest (if any) in such condemnation or eminent domain action,
including any future awards therein, insofar as they are attributable to the
Transferred Assets threatened to be taken, except that Sellers shall reserve
and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Sellers) all rights, titles, interests
and claims against third Persons for the recovery of Sellers costs and
expenses incurred prior to the Closing in defending or asserting rights in
such action with respect to the Transferred Assets.

Accountant shall not assign a value to any Submitted Item greater than the

Adjustment Amount, including the definitions provided in this Agreement

which determination shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the Parties
absent manifest error, fraud or manifest disregard for the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)(ii)_ (and in the event of such manifest error or
disregard, the written determination shall be referred back to the
Independent Accountant to correct the same). All fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant and of any enforcement of the determination thereof,
shall be borne by Buyer.

 

(c) _Escrow Mechanics_. In each case, in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement:

 

(i) From and after the Closing, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the

2.8(c)_, and such amount shall thereafter be deemed to be the " _Post-Closing
Holdback Amount_ " for all purposes hereof.

 

(ii) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within one Business Day,
after a Final Determination with respect to the Net Adjustment Amount
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_, Sellers shall
deliver a written instruction to the Escrow Agent, with a copy to Buyer,
instructing the Escrow Agent as follows:

(A) if the Net Adjustment Amount is negative and the absolute value of
such amount is less than the Post-Closing Holdback Amount, then the Escrow
Agent shall disburse (1) an amount equal to the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount to Buyer and (2) any remaining Post-Closing Holdback Amount
(after giving effect to the disbursement to Buyer in _clause (1)_ above) to
Sellers;

(B) if the Net Adjustment Amount is negative and the absolute value of
such amount is greater than or equal to the Post-Closing Holdback Amount, then
the Escrow Agent shall disburse an amount equal to the Post-Closing Holdback
Amount to Buyer, and Sellers shall have no further liability to Buyer with
respect to the Net Adjustment Amount;

(C) if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive then (1) the Escrow Agent
shall disburse an amount equal to the Post-Closing Holdback Amount to Sellers
and (2) concurrently with the delivery of the written instruction to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)(ii)(C)_, Buyer shall
deposit an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in an account or accounts to be designated by
Sellers; and

 

(D) if the Net Adjustment Amount is equal to zero, then Escrow Agent shall
disburse an amount equal to the Post-Closing Holdback Amount to Sellers.

33

    

Section 6.4 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, stamp, transfer, motor vehicle
registration, sales, use, value added, excise and other similar non-income
Taxes and all filing and recording fees (and any penalties and interest
associated with such Taxes and fees) arising from or relating to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne by Buyer, regardless of the Party on whom
liability is imposed under the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Buyer will consult and cooperate in
timely preparing and making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as
may be required to comply with the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes, including by recording the Conveyance Documents, and will
cooperate and otherwise take commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
available refunds for or exemptions from such Transfer Taxes, including
preparing exemption certificates and other instruments as are applicable to
claim available exemptions from the payment of Transfer Taxes under
applicable Law and executing and delivering such affidavits and forms as are
reasonably requested by the other Party.

(b)  _Asset Taxes_. Sellers shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes for
any period or portion thereof ending prior to the Effective Time, and Buyer
shall be allocated and bear all Asset Taxes for any period or portion thereof
that begins at or after the Effective Time. For purposes of this _Section_ __
_ 6.4(b)_, (i) Asset Taxes that are attributable to the severance or
production of Hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the period in which the
severance or production giving rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, (ii) Asset
Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts or imposed on a
transactional basis (other than such Asset Taxes described in _clause (i)_ or
_(iii)_ ), shall be allocated to the period in which the transaction giving
rise to such Asset Taxes occurred, and (iii) Asset Taxes that are ad valorem,
property or other Asset Taxes imposed on a periodic basis pertaining to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle
Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning at the Effective Time by prorating each such Asset
Tax based on the number of days in the applicable Straddle Period that occur
before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the
number of days in such Straddle Period that occur on or after the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, on the other hand. To the extent the actual
amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time an adjustment is to be made
with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to _Article II_ , the Parties shall
utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount of such
Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of
an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by Sellers) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Closing Statement as finally determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other
to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Asset
Tax that is allocable to such Party under this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_. Buyer
shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns
and the payment to the applicable Governmental Entity of all Asset Taxes that
become due and payable on or after the Closing Date, and Buyer shall
indemnify and hold Sellers harmless for any failure to file such Tax Returns
and to make such payments. Sellers shall be responsible for the preparation
and timely filing of any Tax Returns and payment to the applicable
Governmental Entities of all Asset Taxes that become due and payable prior to
the Closing Date, and Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any
failure to file such Tax Returns and to make such payments.

 



34

    

(c) _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but no later than 90
days thereafter, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers, an allocation
schedule setting forth the amounts to be allocated among Sellers and among the
Transferred Assets of each Seller, pursuant to (and to the extent necessary to
comply with) Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable regulations
promulgated thereunder (or, if applicable, any similar provision under state,
local or foreign Law or regulation) (the " _Proposed Allocation Statement_ ").
Sellers will have 20 Business Days following delivery of the Proposed
Allocation Statement during which to notify Buyer in writing (an " _Allocation
Notice of Objection_ ") of any objections to the Proposed Allocation
Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis of their objections.
If Sellers fail to deliver an Allocation Notice of Objection in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)(i)_ the Proposed Allocation Statement will be
conclusive and binding on all Parties and will become the " _Final Allocation
Statement_." If Sellers submit an Allocation Notice of Objection, then for 20
Business Days after the date Buyer receives the Allocation Notice of
Objection, Buyer and Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts
to agree on the allocations. Failing such agreement within 20 Business Days
of such notice, the unresolved allocations will be submitted to an
independent, internationally-recognized accounting firm mutually agreeable to
Buyer and Sellers, which firm will be instructed to determine its best
estimate of the allocation schedule based on its determination of the
unresolved allocations and provide a written description of the basis for its
determination within 45 Business Days after submission, such written
determination to be final, binding and conclusive. The fees and expenses of
such accounting firm will be apportioned among Sellers and Buyer equally. For
the avoidance of doubt, in administering any Action, the Bankruptcy Court
shall not be required to apply the Final Allocation Statement in determining
the manner in which the Adjusted Purchase Price should be allocated as between
Sellers and their respective estates.

 

(ii) Sellers and Buyer and their respective Affiliates will report, act, and
file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to IRS Form 8594) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation Statement.
Neither Sellers nor Buyer will take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the Final
Allocation Statement unless required to do so by applicable Law.

(d) _Cooperation and Audits_. Buyer and Sellers will cooperate fully with
each other regarding Tax matters and will make available to the other as
reasonably requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes
with regard to the Transferred Assets and Continuing Employees until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or extension thereof or
the conclusion of all audits, appeals or litigation with respect to such
Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ to the
contrary, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not be required to provide to
Sellers and their Affiliates any records, Tax Returns or any other
information, in each case, which includes any information not solely related
to the Transferred Assets or Continuing Employees.

 



35

    

Section 6.5 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ sets forth the names of all individuals who are
Seller Employees as of September 11, 2019 and whose job responsibilities
relate to the ownership, operation or use of the Business (the individuals set
forth on _Schedule 6.5(a)_ , as such Schedule shall be updated by Sellers in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, the " _Asset_ __ _
Employees_"). _Schedule 6.5(a)_ also sets forth, for each Asset Employee as
applicable, the Asset Employees job title, date of hire, work
location, exempt or non-exempt status, leave status (including, if
applicable, type of leave and expected return date), annual base salary and
target bonus opportunity for 2019 (the " _Asset Employees Schedule_ "). The
Asset Employees Schedule shall be held in confidence and shall not be filed
with the Bankruptcy Court (unless under seal). From time to time following the
date hereof (and not later than fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
expected Closing Date), to the extent necessary, Sellers shall update the
Asset Employees Schedule to reflect any changes thereto permitted by this
Agreement. Sellers shall provide Buyer with any such updated Asset Employees
Schedule at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the expected Closing
Date. Buyer, in its sole discretion, may add Seller Employees to _Schedule
6.5(a)_ by providing written notice of such additions to Sellers not later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date.

(b) Prior to the expected Closing Date, Buyer (or an Affiliate thereof) may,
in Buyers sole discretion, make oral or written offers of employment to any
of the Asset Employees effective as of the Closing, and Sellers shall
terminate the employment of any such Asset Employee who is not on leave
effective as of the Closing; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall not be required to make an offer
of employment to any Asset Employee (and shall have no obligation to hire any
Asset Employee). Such offers of employment shall be on such terms and subject
to such conditions as the Buyer determines in its sole discretion. All Asset
Employees who accept employment with Buyer and who subsequently commence
employment with Buyer, pursuant to an offer described either in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ or in _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)_ are referred to herein
as "Continuing Employees" and the date on which any Continuing Employee so
commences employment shall be referred to herein as such Continuing
Employees "Transfer Date." Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer in respect of
Buyers efforts to hire and retain any Asset Employee who accepts an offer of
employment with Buyer.

 

(c) With respect to any Asset Employee who is on leave as of the Closing Date,
Buyer may, but is not required to, make an offer of employment to such Asset
Employee with Buyer, contingent upon such Asset Employees return to active
status within three (3) months following the Closing Date or such longer
period as may be required by applicable Law and Sellers, if applicable, shall
terminate the employment of such Asset Employee on the date of their return to
active status.

(d) All Continuing Employees shall become employees of Buyer, effective as of
11:59 p.m. CT on the applicable Transfer Date.

(e) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
group health plans of Buyer or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to the
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent that such
conditions, limitations and waiting periods were waived, satisfied or
inapplicable under an analogous Seller Plan, (ii) give each Continuing
Employee credit for any co-

 



36

    

 payments, deductibles and similar amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
and his or her eligible dependents prior to the Closing Date under an
analogous Seller Plan with respect to the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Sellers prior to the Closing Date
for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under
each benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employee
participates following the Closing, to the extent such service was credited
under an analogous Seller Plan, except for benefit accrual under
defined benefit pension plans, vesting under equity-based or similar
incentive compensation award, for purposes of qualifying for any retiree
health or welfare benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an
amendment of any Seller Plan or any employee benefit plan of Buyer, (ii)
prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from amending or terminating any
compensation or benefit plan of Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date in accordance with their terms; (iii) prevent Buyer or any of
its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any Continuing Employee or (iv) confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, including
any right to employment, any terms of employment or continued employment for
any period. No Person other than the Parties is a third-party beneficiary or
entitled to any other rights under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or under any
other provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement shall require Buyer to make available to any
Person any specific or specific-level of health insurance or other insurance,
severance vacation, pension, compensation or other benefits; _provided_ ,
that it otherwise complies with its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.5_.

being provided to it in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by reference in
their entirety (and the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in
full force and effect until the Closing, at which time all obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate (other than those which
expressly survive the termination thereof pursuant to its terms)). If, for any
reason, the Closing does not occur, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Buyer
acknowledges and understands that this Agreement may be publicly filed in the
Bankruptcy Court and further made available by Debtors to prospective bidders
and that, except as prohibited herein, such disclosure will not be deemed to
violate any confidentiality obligations owing to Buyer, whether pursuant to
this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise.

information relating to the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities,
will be valuable and proprietary to Buyer and its Affiliates. Debtors agree
that, from and after the Closing, no Debtor will disclose to any Person any
information relating to Buyer and its Affiliates, the Transferred Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities, except as required by Law or Order or Bankruptcy
Court requirement, or as otherwise becomes available in the public domain
other than through any action by any Debtor in violation of its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by Buyer or Sellers that are
required by applicable securities or other Laws or regulations or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the disclosing
Party or its Affiliates, provided that such disclosures shall be made only to
the extent required thereunder.

 



37

by any Debtor in the Bankruptcy Court or if disclosure is otherwise required
by applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court; _provided_ , _however_ , that

required disclosure.

Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement
represents the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions and
agreements between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement can be amended, supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof
can be waived, only by written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement signed by the Party against whom enforcement of any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver is sought. The waiver by any Party of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement will not operate or be construed as
a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder will operate as a
waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of such right, power
or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.

 

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement will create or be deemed to create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either Sellers or Buyer (by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempted assignment
without the required consents will be void; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
Buyer may assign some or all of its rights or delegate some or all of its
obligations hereunder to one or more Affiliates and (b) Sellers may assign
some or all of their rights or delegate some or all of their obligations
hereunder to successor entities (including any liquidating trust) pursuant to
a Chapter 11 plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, in the case of each
_clause_ __ _ (a)_ and _(b)_ above, without any other Partys consent.
No assignment or delegation of any obligations hereunder will relieve the
Parties of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment, the
references in this Agreement to Sellers or Buyer will also apply to any such
assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

Section 9.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
will bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument
contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all proceedings incident thereto.

 

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Oklahoma. 

Section 9.7 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damages would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that damages at law may
be an inadequate remedy for the breach of any of the covenants, promises and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and, accordingly, any Party will
be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any such breach, and to
specifically enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement,
including without limitation specific performance of such covenants, promises
or agreements (including to cause Buyer to consummate the Closing and to make
the payments contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_)
or an Order enjoining a Party from any threatened, or from the continuation of
any actual, breach of the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The rights set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ will be in
addition to any other rights which a Party may have at law or in equity
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



44

    

(b) The Parties hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
respective covenants and obligations of Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, under
this Agreement all in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.7_.

 

Section 9.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver
of Jury_ __ _ Trial_.

 

(a) Without limiting any Partys right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy
Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court will retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce
the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes which may
arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or
default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any and
all proceedings related to the foregoing will be filed and maintained only in
the Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby consent to and submit to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court for such purposes and
will receive notices at such locations as indicated in _Section_ __ _ 9.2_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Bankruptcy Proceeding has been closed
pursuant to Section 350 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Parties agree
to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, or in
the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, in the Oklahoma County District Court, for the
resolution of any such claim or dispute. The Parties hereby irrevocably waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Action brought
in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the Parties agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby consents to process being served by any other
Party in any Action by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service
will not be effective until the actual receipt thereof by the Party being
served. 

(c) Each Party to this Agreement waives any right to trial by jury in any
Action regarding this Agreement or any provision hereof.

 

Section 9.9 _Interpretation; Construction_.
