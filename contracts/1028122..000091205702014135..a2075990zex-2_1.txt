is made and entered into as of April 5, 2002, by and among DIVINE, INC., a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), DVC ACQUISITION COMPANY, a Delaware corporation
and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and VIANT
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"). Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company are referred to collectively herein as the "PARTIES." Capitalized terms
used herein are defined as referenced in the Table of Defined Terms contained
herein.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have determined that it is in the best interests of each corporation and
their respective stockholders that the Company and Parent enter into a business
combination through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the
"MERGER") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the Merger and declared the
Merger advisable to their respective stockholders;

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock
of the Company shall be converted into shares of common stock of Parent at the
rate set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE") and that this
Agreement shall be a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-2(g);

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
all officers and directors of the Company and their respective affiliates and
certain other principal stockholders of the Company (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS")
are entering into Company Voting Agreements in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A-1 (the "COMPANY VOTING AGREEMENT"); and

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the Company's willingness to enter into this
Agreement, all executive officers and directors of Parent and certain affiliates
of such officers and directors (the "PARENT STOCKHOLDERS") are entering into
Parent Voting Agreements in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A-2 (the "PARENT VOTING AGREEMENT").

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parties hereby agree
as follows:

in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease, and the Company shall be the successor or surviving corporation and shall

sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."

         1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
Parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the duly executed

MERGER") with the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in
such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, and shall
take all other action required by law to effect the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as shall be agreed
by the Parties and provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

         1.3 CLOSING. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article
VIII, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, at the offices of counsel for Parent, on the second business day
after all of the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the
Merger as set forth in Article VII have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied or waived on the
Closing Date), or such other date, time or place as shall be agreed to in
writing by the Parties (the "CLOSING DATE").

         1.4 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all

connection with the Merger.

Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of the Company, or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions

         share of the Company ("COMPANY SHARES") (including the associated
         Company Rights) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
         Effective Time (excluding any Company Shares described in

<Page>

         SECTION 4.1(d)), shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
         on the part of the holder thereof, be converted automatically into the
         right to receive an amount per share equal to 3.977 shares (the "STOCK
         PAYMENT") of Parent's Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share
         (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK") (and associated rights to purchase Parent's
         Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per
         share (the "PARENT RIGHTS")) (rounded down to the nearest full share).
         The shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
         Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby are referred to herein
         as the "PARENT SHARES," and the Stock Payment, together with the
         applicable amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, are referred to

         Consideration pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) shall, by virtue of the
         Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease
         to be outstanding, be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a
         certificate representing any such Company Shares shall thereafter cease
         to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares and the
         associated Company Rights, except the right to receive for each of the
         Company Shares, together with the associated Company Rights, upon the
         surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 4.2, the Per
         Share Consideration, as specified above (rounded down to the nearest
         full share).

         $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
         prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
         any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
         automatically into and exchanged for one (1) validly issued, fully paid
         and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
         the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate representing any
         shares of Merger Sub shall continue to represent ownership of such
         shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                  (c) Outstanding Company Options. At the Effective Time, each
         Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is then outstanding
         and unexercised pursuant to the Company's 1996 Stock Option Plan (the
         "1996 OPTION PLAN") and the Company's 1999 Stock Option Plan as amended
         and restated (the "1999 OPTION PLAN") shall be assumed by Parent and
         shall become and represent an option to purchase (an "ASSUMED OPTION")
         that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the
         nearest full share), determined by multiplying (A) the number of
         Company Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
         Effective Time by (B) the Conversion Ratio, at a per share exercise
         price equal to the exercise price of such Company Option divided the
         Conversion Ratio rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Parent shall pay
         cash to holders of Company Options in lieu of issuing fractional shares
         of Parent Common Stock upon the exercise of Assumed Options for Parent
         Common Stock. Parent shall reserve a sufficient number of shares of
         Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of such Assumed Options.
         For purposes hereof, the "CONVERSION RATIO" shall be equal to the sum
         of (i) Stock Payment and (ii) the quotient of (A) the Per Share
         Dividend Amount and (B) $.55.

                  (d) Cancellation of Parent Owned and Treasury Stock.
         Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all of the Company Shares,
         together with the associated Company


                                       4
<Page>

         Rights, that are owned by Parent, any direct or indirect wholly-owned
         Subsidiary of Parent or by the Company as treasury stock shall
         automatically cease to be outstanding, shall be canceled and shall
         cease to exist and no Parent Shares shall be delivered in exchange
         therefor.

                  (e) Adjustment for Organic Changes. In the event of any
         reclassification, stock split, distribution, stock dividend,
         reorganization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or
         other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock, any change or
         conversion of Parent Common Stock into other securities or any other
         dividend or distribution in Parent Common Stock with respect to
         outstanding Parent Common Stock (or if a record date with respect to
         any of the foregoing should occur) prior to the Effective Time,
         appropriate and proportionate adjustments, if any, shall be made to the
         number of Parent Shares, the Stock Payment and the Conversion Ratio,
         and all references to the number of Parent Shares, the Stock Payment
         and the Conversion Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be to the
         number of Parent Shares, the Stock Payment and the Conversion Ratio as
         so adjusted.

         4.2 PAYMENT FOR COMPANY SHARES IN THE MERGER. The manner of making
payment for Company Shares in the Merger shall be as follows:

                  (a) Exchange Agent. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent
         shall make available to Computershare Investor Services, LLC, or
         another entity mutually agreed upon by the Parties (the "EXCHANGE
         AGENT"), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, a sufficient
         number of certificates representing the Parent Shares required to
         effect the delivery of the aggregate consideration in Parent Shares and
         cash for the Fractional Securities Fund (as defined in SECTION 4.3)
         (collectively, the "SHARE CONSIDERATION" and the certificates
         representing the Parent Shares comprising such Share Consideration
         being referred to hereinafter as the "STOCK MERGER EXCHANGE FUND"). The
         Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
         Per Share Consideration out of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund and the
         Fractional Securities Fund, as the case may be. The Stock Merger
         Exchange Fund and the Fractional Securities Fund shall not be used for
         any purpose other than as set forth in this Agreement.

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
         the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate
         or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
         represented outstanding Company Shares and associated Company Rights
         (the "CERTIFICATES") (i) a form of letter of transmittal, in a form
         reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (which shall specify that
         delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
         Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
         to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
         surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor. Subject to SECTION
         4.5, upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange
         Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, each duly executed,
         and any other reasonably required documents, the holder of such
         Certificates shall be entitled to receive for each of the Company
         Shares and associated Company Rights represented by such Certificates,
         the Per Share


                                       5
<Page>

         Consideration, without interest, allocable to such Certificates and the
         Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so
         surrendered, such Certificates shall represent solely the right to
         receive the Per Share Consideration allocable to such Certificates.

                  (c) Distributions with respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
         dividends or other distributions on Parent Common Stock having a record
         date after the Effective Time and payable to the holders of record
         thereof after the Effective Time will be paid to Persons entitled by
         reason of the Merger to receive Parent Shares until such Persons
         surrender their Certificates as provided in SECTION 4.2(b) above. Upon
         such surrender, there shall be paid to the Person in whose name the
         Parent Shares are issued any dividends or other distributions having a
         record date after the Effective Time and payable with respect to such
         Parent Shares between the Effective Time and the time of such
         surrender. After such surrender there shall be paid to the Person in
         whose name the Parent Shares are issued any dividends or other
         distributions on such Parent Shares which shall have a record date
         after the date of such surrender. In no event shall the Persons
         entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be entitled
         to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions.

                  (d) Transfers of Ownership. If any certificate representing
         Parent Shares is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
         Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be
         a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall
         be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
         the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
         transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
         certificates for such Parent Shares in a name other than that of the
         registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to
         the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
         is not applicable.

                  (e) No Liability. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any of the
         Parties shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Per Share
         Consideration or any dividend to which the holders thereof are
         entitled, that are delivered to a public official pursuant to
         applicable escheat law. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to
         vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent
         Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
         receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
         distributed with respect to such Parent Shares for the account of the
         Persons entitled thereto.

                  (f) Termination of Funds. Subject to applicable law, any
         portion of the Stock Merger Exchange Fund or the Fractional Securities
         Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company
         for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
         upon demand of Parent, and any former stockholder of the Company shall
         thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their applicable claim
         for the Per Share Consideration for their Company Shares.



                                       6

         4.3 CASH IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL PARENT SHARES. No fractional Parent
Shares shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Shares and
associated Company Rights shall be entitled to receive in lieu of any fractional
Parent Shares to which such holder otherwise would have been entitled pursuant
to SECTION 4.2 (after taking into account all Company Shares and associated
Company Rights then held of record by such holder) a cash payment in an amount
equal to the product of (i) the fractional interest of a Parent Share to which
such holder otherwise would have been entitled and (ii) the closing sale price
of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market ("NNM") on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "PARENT STOCK PRICE") (the cash
comprising such aggregate payments in lieu of fractional Parent Shares being
hereinafter referred to as the "FRACTIONAL SECURITIES FUND").

         4.4 TRANSFER OF SHARES AFTER THE EFFECTIVE TIME. All Per Share
Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Shares and
associated Company Rights in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares and associated
Company Rights, and no further registration of transfers shall be made. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Per
Share Consideration as provided in this Article IV.

         4.5 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. In the event any
Certificates evidencing Company Shares and associated Company Rights shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Consideration with respect
thereto, and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof
are entitled; provided, however, that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a customary bond in such sum
as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

                                    ARTICLE V

         qualified and in good standing as a foreign entity in each jurisdiction
         where the properties owned, leased or operated, or the business
         conducted, by it require such qualification, except where failure to be
         so qualified or in good standing as a foreign entity could not,
         individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
         have all requisite power and authority (corporate or otherwise) to own
         their respective properties and to carry on their respective businesses

                  preemptive rights), commitments or any other agreements of any
                  character which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
                  party to, or may be bound by, allowing it or requiring it to
                  issue, transfer, grant, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire any
                  shares of capital stock or any of its securities or rights
                  convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to
                  subscribe for, any shares of capital stock of the Parent or
                  any of its Subsidiaries (the "PARENT EQUIVALENTS"). Set forth

                  and the plan or agreement pursuant to which such Parent
                  Equivalent is outstanding. Pursuant to the Parent Option Plans
                  and the Parent Equivalents, Parent has reserved for issuance a
                  sufficient number of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
                  exercise of the Parent Options or Parent Equivalents and all
                  of the Parent Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of the
                  Parent Options have been registered under the Securities Act
                  pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 which
                  registration statement has been declared and remains
                  effective. Since December 31, 2001, no Parent Options or
                  Parent Equivalents have been accelerated or had their terms
                  materially modified.

                           (iii) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, there
                  are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other
                  agreements or understandings to which the Parent is a party or
                  to which it is bound relating to the voting of any shares of
                  the capital stock of the Parent.

                           (iv) There are no existing rights with respect to the
                  registration of Parent Common Stock under the Securities Act
                  of 1933, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated
                  thereunder (the "SECURITIES ACT"), whose holders may request
                  Parent register their shares of Parent Common Stock
                  contemporaneously with the registration of Parent Shares
                  issued pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement.

                  (d) Listings. Parent's securities are not listed, or quoted,
         for trading on any U.S. domestic or foreign securities exchange or
         quotation service, other than the NNM. Parent has not received any
         communications (whether written or oral) from the NASD that it does not
         meet the listing qualifications of the NNM.

                  (e) Authority Relative to this Agreement. The Board of
         Directors of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and declared it,
         the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby advisable, and

         consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby and Merger
         Sub has the requisite corporate power and authority to approve,
         authorize, execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
         transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of Parent has
         approved this Agreement and declared it, the Merger and the
         transactions contemplated hereby and the related issuance of Parent

         power and authority to approve, authorize, execute and deliver this
         Agreement and, upon adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
         Parent, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. No other
         corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary
         to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
         contemplated hereby, other than the approval of this Agreement and the
         Merger by the stockholders of Parent in accordance with the DGCL and
         the rules of the NNM. This Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
         Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
         validly authorized by the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub
         and by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub. This Agreement has
         been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub
         and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
         agreement of the Company, constitutes the valid and binding agreement
         of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each entity in accordance
         with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy,
         insolvency, reorganization and other laws of general applicability
         relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general principles of
         equity.

                  (f) Present Compliance with Obligations and Laws. Neither
         Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is: (i) in violation of its
         certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar charter documents; (ii)
         in default in the performance of any obligation, agreement or condition
         of any debt instrument which (with or without the passage of time or
         the giving of notice, or both) affords to any Person the right to (A)
         accelerate any indebtedness, (B) place an Encumbrance upon any of the
         material assets of Parent or any Subsidiary, (C) terminate any material
         right existing under any such obligation, agreement condition or debt
         instrument, or (D) seize or sell (through any means) any of the
         material assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) in default
         under or breach of (with or without the passage of time or the giving
         of notice, or both) any other contract to which it is a party or by
         which it or its assets are bound; or (iv) in violation of any law,
         regulation, administrative order or judicial order, decree or judgment
         (domestic or foreign) (other than laws relating to employment matters)
         applicable to it or its business or assets, except where any violation,
         default or breach under items (ii), (iii), or (iv) could not reasonably
         be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
         Adverse Effect on Parent.

                  (g) Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Neither the
         execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub nor
         the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
         contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of
         any provision of the respective certificate of incorporation (or other
         similar charter documents) or bylaws (or other similar documents) of
         Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) require any consent, approval,
         authorization or permit of, or registration or filing with or
         notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, in each
         case, by or on behalf of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except (A)
         in connection with the applicable requirements, if any, of the
         Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the
         "HSR ACT"), (B) pursuant to the applicable requirements of the
         Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
         the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "EXCHANGE ACT"),
         and the NNM, (C) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to
         the DGCL and appropriate documents with the


                                       10
<Page>

         relevant authorities of other states in which Parent is authorized to
         do business, (D) as may be required by any applicable state securities
         laws, (E) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
         registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under the
         antitrust or competition laws of any foreign country, or (F) where the
         failure to obtain such consent, approval, authorization or permit, or
         to make such registration, filing or notification, could not reasonably
         be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
         Adverse Effect on Parent or adversely affect the ability of Parent to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) result in a
         violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse
         of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
         cancellation or acceleration or lien or other charge or encumbrance)
         under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any indenture,
         note, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
         which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
         their assets may be bound, except for such violations, breaches and
         defaults (or rights of termination, cancellation or acceleration or
         lien or other charge or encumbrance) which, individually or in the
         aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect on Parent or adversely affect the ability of Parent to
         consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) cause the
         suspension or revocation of any authorizations, consents, approvals or
         licenses currently in effect which, individually or in the aggregate,
         could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
         Parent; or (v) assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or
         permits and registrations, filings or notifications referred to in
         SECTION 5.1(g)(ii) are duly and timely obtained or made, violate any
         order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable
         to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or to any of their respective
         assets, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate,
         could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
         Parent or adversely affect the ability of Parent to consummate the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (h) Litigation. There are no actions, suits, claims,
         investigations or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
         threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that individually
         or in the aggregate, (i) could reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect on Parent, or (ii) materially and adversely
         affects Parent's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
         to any outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree which
         (A) has or may have the effect of prohibiting or impairing any business
         practice of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, any acquisition of
         property (tangible or intangible) by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
         the conduct of the business by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
         Parent's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
         (B), individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. SECTION 5.1(h) of the Parent
         Disclosure Schedule lists each action, suit, claim, investigation or
         proceeding of which (i) Parent has Knowledge and (ii) is for an amount
         greater than $50,000.

                  (i) SEC Reports; Financial Statements.

                           (i) Except for documents related to the transactions
                  contemplated hereby, Parent has filed all forms, reports and
                  documents and all amendments


                                       11
<Page>

                  thereto with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
                  "SEC") required to be filed by it pursuant to the federal
                  securities laws and the SEC rules and regulations thereunder
                  in effect as of the time of such filing or amendment, all of
                  which when filed complied as to form in all material respects
                  with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
                  Exchange Act (collectively, the "PARENT SEC REPORTS"), and all
                  of which are available through the SEC's Electronic Data
                  Gathering and Retrieval System ("EDGAR"). None of the Parent
                  SEC Reports, including, without limitation, any financial
                  statements or schedules included therein, at the time filed
                  (or if amended, supplemented or superseded by a filing prior
                  to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
                  filing) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
                  omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
                  or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
                  of the circumstances under which they were made, not
                  misleading. None of Parent's Subsidiaries is required to file
                  any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC.

                           (ii) When filed with the SEC, the consolidated
                  balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
                  income, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows
                  (including the related notes thereto) of Parent included in
                  the Parent SEC Reports (collectively, "PARENT FINANCIAL
                  STATEMENTS") compiled as to form in all material respects with
                  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the
                  published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
                  thereto, were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
                  consistent basis throughout, or for, the periods stated
                  therein (except in the case of unaudited interim financial
                  statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under
                  the Exchange Act), and presented fairly, in all material
                  respects, the consolidated financial position of Parent and
                  its consolidated Subsidiaries as of their respective dates,
                  and the consolidated results of their operations and their
                  cash flows for the periods presented therein, except that the
                  unaudited interim financial statements do not include footnote
                  disclosure of the type associated with audited financial
                  statements and were or are subject to normal and recurring
                  year-end adjustments that were not or are not expected to be
                  material in amount, type or effect.

                           (iii) Since December 31, 2001, there has not been any
                  material change, by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in
                  accounting principles, methods or policies, except as required
                  by GAAP. There are no material amendments or modifications to
                  agreements, documents or other instruments, which previously
                  had been filed by Parent with the SEC pursuant to the
                  Securities Act or the Exchange Act, which have not been filed
                  with the SEC but which are required to be filed.

                  (j) No Liabilities. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
         has any indebtedness, obligations or liabilities of any kind (whether
         accrued, absolute, or contingent, and whether due or to become due or
         asserted or unasserted), and, to the Knowledge of Parent, there is no
         reasonable basis for the assertion of any claim with respect to any
         indebtedness, obligation or liability of any nature against the Parent
         or any of its Subsidiaries, except for indebtedness, obligations and
         liabilities (i) which are fully


                                       12
<Page>

         reflected in, adequately reserved against or otherwise described in the
         most recent Parent Financial Statements, (ii) which have been incurred
         after the most recent Parent Financial Statements in the ordinary
         course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) which are
         obligations to perform under executory contracts in the ordinary course
         of business (none of which is a liability resulting from a breach of
         contract or warranty, tort, infringement or legal action), or (iv)
         except as otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to (i)-(iii)
         above which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                  (k) Absence of Certain Changes of Events. Except for actions
         expressly contemplated by this Agreement since December 31, 2001,
         Parent and each Subsidiary has conducted its business only in the
         ordinary course and, since such date, there has not been (i) any
         Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (ii) any damage, destruction or loss
         of assets of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not
         covered by insurance) that has had or could reasonably be expected to
         have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
         Parent, (iii) any material revaluation by Parent or any of its
         Subsidiaries of any of their respective assets, including, without
         limitation, writing down the value of capitalized software or inventory
         or deferred tax assets or writing off notes or accounts receivable
         except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
         practice; or (iv) any other action or event that would have required
         the consent of the Company pursuant to SECTION 6.2 had such action or
         event occurred after the date of this Agreement.

                  (l) Brokers and Finders. Neither Parent nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has employed any investment banker, broker, finder,
         consultant or intermediary in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement which would be entitled to any
         investment banking, brokerage, finder's or similar fee or commission in
         connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (m) S-4 Registration Statement and Proxy Statement. None of
         the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent for inclusion or
         incorporation by reference in the S-4 Registration Statement or the
         Proxy Statement will (i) in the case of the S-4 Registration Statement,
         at the time it becomes effective or at the Effective Time, contain any
         untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
         statements therein not misleading, or (ii) in the case of the Proxy
         Statement, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement, at the
         time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent Stockholders
         Meeting and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a
         material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
         of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at
         any time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to Parent,
         its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective affiliates, officers and
         directors should occur which is required to be described in an
         amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement or the S-4
         Registration Statement, Parent shall promptly inform the Company so
         that such event may be so described and such amendment or supplement
         promptly filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to
         the stockholders of the Company and Parent, if


                                       13
<Page>

         necessary. The S-4 Registration Statement will (with respect to Parent
         (on a consolidated basis) and Merger Sub) comply as to form in all
         material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act. The
         Proxy Statement will (with respect to Parent (on a consolidated basis)
         and Merger Sub) comply as to form with the requirements of the Exchange
         Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub make no
         representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by,
         or related to, the Company or any of its affiliates or advisors, which
         is contained in any of the foregoing, documents.

                  (n) Taxes.

                           (i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely
                  filed (after taking into account any extensions to file) all
                  material federal, state, local and foreign Returns required by
                  applicable Tax law to be filed by Parent and each of its
                  Subsidiaries. All such Returns are true and correct in all
                  material respects and have been completed in accordance with
                  applicable law. All Taxes owed by Parent or any of its
                  Subsidiaries have been paid other than Taxes that in an
                  aggregate amount would not be material to (i) Parent and its
                  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) Parent's software
                  business or management hosting business. Other than any
                  reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
                  differences between book and Tax treatment, Parent has made
                  accruals for Taxes on the Parent Financial Statements that are
                  adequate to cover any Tax liability of Parent and each of its
                  Subsidiaries determined in accordance with GAAP through the
                  date of the most recent Parent Financial Statements, other
                  than accruals for Taxes in an aggregate amount that would not
                  be material to (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
                  whole or (ii) Parent's software business or management hosting
                  business, and has not incurred any Tax liability since the
                  date of the most recent Parent Financial Statements other than
                  in the ordinary course of business. To Parent's Knowledge,
                  there is no reasonable basis for the assertion of any claims
                  for Taxes that if adversely determined would be material,
                  either individually or in the aggregate, to (i) Parent and its
                  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) Parent's software
                  business or managed hosting business.

                           (ii) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have
                  withheld with respect to its employees, creditors, independent
                  contractors, stockholders or other parties all Taxes required
                  to be withheld and has timely paid over such Taxes to the
                  appropriate Governmental Authority.

                           (iii) There is no Tax deficiency outstanding,
                  assessed, or to Parent's Knowledge, proposed against Parent or
                  any of its Subsidiaries other than Tax deficiencies (A) that
                  are not material to (x) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as
                  a whole and (y) Parent's software business and management
                  hosting business or (B) with recent to which a reserve has
                  been established in the Parent Financial Statement for the
                  period ending December 31, 2001. Neither Parent nor any of its
                  Subsidiaries has executed or requested any waiver of any
                  statute of limitations on or extending the period for the
                  assessment or collection of any Tax that is still


                                       14
<Page>

                  in effect. There are no liens for Taxes on the assets of
                  Parent or of any of its Subsidiaries other than with respect
                  to Taxes not yet due and payable.

                           (iv) To Parent's Knowledge, no claim has ever been
                  made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where any of
                  Parent and its Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that
                  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to
                  taxation by that jurisdiction.

                           (v) No Tax audit or other examination of Parent or
                  any of its Subsidiaries is presently in progress, nor has
                  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been notified either in
                  writing or orally of any request for any such Tax audit or
                  other examination.

                           (vi) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
                  filed any consent agreement under Section 341(f) of the Code
                  or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any
                  disposition of a subsection (f) asset (as defined in Section
                  341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by the Parent.

                           (vii) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
                  party to (A) any agreement with a party other than Parent or
                  any of its Subsidiaries providing for the allocation or
                  payment of Tax liabilities or payment for Tax benefits with
                  respect to a consolidated, combined or unitary Return which
                  Return includes or included the Parent or any Subsidiary or
                  (B) any Parent Significant Tax Agreement other than any Parent
                  Significant Tax Agreement described in (A).

                           (viii) Except for the group of which Parent and its
                  Subsidiaries are now presently members, neither the Parent nor
                  any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of an
                  "affiliated group" of corporations within the meaning of
                  Section 1504 of the Code. None of Parent or any of its
                  Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any person
                  (other than the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) under
                  Treasury Regulationss. 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
                  state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor,
                  by contract, or otherwise. There is no excess loss account,
                  deferred intercompany gain or loss, or intercompany items as
                  such terms are defined in the regulations promulgated under
                  the Code, that exist with respect to Parent or any of its
                  Subsidiaries.

                           (ix) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
                  party to any joint venture, partnership or, to Parent's
                  Knowledge, any other arrangement or contract that could be
                  treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

                           (x) None of Parent or its Subsidiaries will be
                  required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item
                  of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
                  portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of
                  any: (A) change in method of accounting for a taxable period
                  ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481 of

                  absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or to
                  become due or asserted or unasserted) with respect thereto. A

                  description and summary of material modifications thereto with
                  respect to each such plan and Form 5310. SECTION 5.1(o) of the
                  Parent Disclosure Schedule contains a description of the
                  material terms of any material unwritten Parent Scheduled Plan
                  as currently in effect as of the date hereof.

                           (iii) To Parent's Knowledge as of the date hereof,
                  each Parent Scheduled Plan (1) has been in material compliance
                  in form and in operation with the material, applicable
                  requirements of ERISA and the Code, and any other material
                  legal requirements; and (2) has been and is operated and
                  administered in compliance with its terms (except as otherwise
                  required by law). Each Parent Scheduled Plan which is intended
                  to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received,
                  or has remaining a period of time to comply for a favorable
                  determination letter or other recognition of exemption from
                  the Internal Revenue Service on which Parent can rely.

                           (iv) With respect to each Parent Scheduled Plan,
                  there are no claims or other proceedings pending or, to the
                  Knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to the assets
                  thereof (other than routine claims for benefits).

                           (v) None of the Parent or any current or former
                  Parent Plan Affiliate has at any time participated in, made
                  contributions to or had any other liability, including
                  contingent liability, with respect to any Parent Scheduled
                  Plan which is a "multi-employer plan" as defined in Section
                  4001 of ERISA, a "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of
                  Section 3(37) of ERISA, a "multiple employer plan" within the
                  meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code, a "multiple employer
                  welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of
                  ERISA or a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

                           (vi) No Parent Scheduled Plan provides, or reflects
                  or represents any liability to provide retiree health coverage
                  to any person for any reason, except as may be required by
                  COBRA or applicable state insurance laws, and neither Parent
                  nor any Parent Plan Affiliate has any liability (whether
                  accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether due or
                  to become due to asserted or unasserted) to any current or
                  former employee, or director (either individually or as a
                  group) to provide retiree health coverage, except to the
                  extent required by applicable continuation coverage statutes,
                  laws or ordinances.

                           (vii) With respect to any Parent Scheduled Plan which
                  is a welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, there
                  is no disqualified benefit (as such term is defined in Code
                  Section 4976(b)) which would subject Parent or any Parent Plan
                  Affiliate to a tax under Code Section 4976(a).

                           (viii) Other than by reason of actions taken
                  following the Closing, neither the execution of this Agreement
                  nor the consummation of the transactions


                                       17

                  former employee of Parent to a material amount of (i)
                  severance pay, (ii) unemployment compensation or (iii) any
                  other payment, (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting

                  or terminate such plan), cause the forgiveness of any
                  indebtedness, or increase the amount of any compensation due
                  to any such employee or former employee or (3) give rise to
                  the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
                  pursuant to the terms of Section 280G of the Code.

                  of the Parent or its Subsidiaries as currently conducted (the
                  "PARENT PROPRIETARY RIGHTS").

                           (ii) Except for Commercial Software and Parent
                  Embedded Products for which Parent has valid licenses which
                  are adequate for the conduct of Parent's business as conducted
                  as of the date hereof, Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
                  either (1) is the sole and exclusive owner of the Parent
                  Proprietary Rights (free and clear of any Encumbrances), and
                  has sole and exclusive rights therein; or (2) has a valid,
                  effective written license for the use and/or distribution of
                  the material covered thereby in connection with the services

                  any licenses with other Subsidiaries that are necessary or
                  appropriate therefor.

                           (iii) To Parent's Knowledge, Parent and its

                  Proprietary Rights of any third Persons and none of the
                  products or services marketed, developed or sold by Parent or
                  its Subsidiaries infringes or otherwise violates any

                           (v) Parent has taken reasonable security measures to
                  safeguard and maintain its rights in the trade secrets
                  included in Parent Proprietary Rights. To Parent's Knowledge,
                  Parent or any Subsidiary trade secrets and all copies of the

                  Parent, no current or prior officers, employees or consultants
                  of Parent claim, and Parent is not aware of any reasonable

                  Parent Proprietary Right as a result of any services performed
                  for Parent or its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to,
                  involvement in the development of any property embodying any

                  Person who participated in the development of Parent Software
                  or any portion thereof (such authors and other persons or

                  all rights to such Parent Software to Parent or any
                  Subsidiary.

                           Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any
                           line of business or conduct business in any
                           geographical area, compete with any person or

                           materially limiting Parent's use or exploitation of
                           the Parent Proprietary Rights;

                                    (7) any agreement, contract or commitment
                           for the purchase of any ownership interest in any

                           business enterprise; or

                                    (8) any joint venture, partnership, and
                           other contract involving a sharing of profits or
                           losses by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries with

                           (ii) A true, accurate and complete copy (including
                  all material amendments thereto) of each agreement, contract,
                  obligation, promise or undertaking set forth in SECTION 5.1(Q)
                  of the Parent Disclosure Schedule and to which the Parent or
                  any Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any Subsidiary

                  contracting parties. No condition exists or event has occurred
                  that, (whether with or without notice or lapse of time or
                  both, or the happening or occurrence of any other event) would
                  constitute a default by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent or,
                  to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under, or
                  result in a right to terminate, any Parent Contract, except as
                  could not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
                  expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                  (r) Unlawful Payments and Contributions. To the Knowledge of
         Parent, neither Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent nor any of their
         respective directors, officers, employees or agents has, with respect
         to the businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (i) used any funds for
         any unlawful contribution, endorsement, gift, entertainment or other

         other unlawful payment to any Person or entity.

                  (s) Environmental Matters. (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries and
         the operations, assets and properties thereof are in material
         compliance with all Environmental Laws; (ii) there are no judicial or
         administrative actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending
         or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
         Subsidiary of the Parent alleging the violation of any Environmental
         Law and neither the Parent nor any Subsidiary of the Parent has
         received written notice from any governmental body or Person alleging
         any violation of or liability under any Environmental Laws, in either
         case which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Parent; (iii) to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
         facts or circumstances which could result in any environmental
         liability which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect on Parent; (iv) neither the Parent nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has ever generated, transported, treated, stored, handled
         or disposed of any Hazardous Material in a manner which, individually
         or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a
         Material Adverse Effect on the Parent; (v) except in compliance with
         Environmental Laws and in a manner that could not reasonably be
         expected to subject the Parent or any Subsidiary to material liability,
         to the Knowledge of the Parent, no Hazardous Materials are present on,
         in, at or under any real property currently owned or leased by the
         Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or were present on, in, at or under
         any other real property at the time it ceased to be owned or leased by
         the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including without limitation,
         containment by means of any underground or aboveground storage


                                       21

         tank); (vi) except as set forth in section 5.1(s) of the Parent
         Disclosure Schedule, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
         underground storage tanks, asbestos which is friable or likely to
         become friable or PCBs present on any real property currently owned or
         leased by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or as a consequence of
         the acts of the Parents, its Subsidiaries, or their agents. For the
         purpose of this SECTION 5.1(S) the following terms have the following
         definitions: (X) "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" means any applicable federal,
         state, local or foreign law (including common law), statute, code,
         ordinance, rule, regulation or other requirement relating to the
         environment, natural resources, or public or employee health and safety
         as amended to date; and (Y) "HAZARDOUS MATERIAL" means any substance,
         material or waste regulated by federal, state or local government,
         including, without limitation, any substance, material or waste which
         is defined as a "hazardous waste," "hazardous material," "hazardous
         substance," "toxic waste" or "toxic substance" under any provision of
         Environmental Law and including but not limited to petroleum and
         petroleum products, other than substances contained in janitorial
         supplies or office products.

                  (t) Title to Properties; Liens; Condition of Properties.
         Parent and its Subsidiaries have good title to, or a valid leasehold
         interest in, the real and personal property, shown on the most recent
         Parent Financial Statements or acquired after the date thereof. None of
         the property owned, leased or used by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
         is subject to any mortgage, pledge, deed of trust, lien, conditional
         sale agreement, security title, encumbrance, or other adverse claim or
         interest of any kind (other than any of the foregoing with respect to
         (i) taxes not yet due and payable, (ii) matters which do not materially
         and adversely affect the use, value or operation of such property, and
         (iii) liens or encumbrances against any landlord's or owner's interest
         in any leased property). Since December 31, 2001, there has not been
         any sale, lease, or any other disposition or distribution by Parent or
         any of its Subsidiaries of any of its assets or properties material to
         Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except transactions in
         the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices.

                  (u) Insurance. All insurance policies (including
         "self-insurance" programs) now maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary
         (the "PARENT INSURANCE POLICIES") are in full force and effect as to
         Parent or its Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary is in
         default under any of the Parent Insurance Policies, and no claim for
         coverage under any of the Parent Insurance Policies has been denied.
         Parent has not received any written notice of cancellation or intent to
         cancel or increase or intent to increase premiums with respect to such
         insurance policies nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, is there any
         reasonable basis for any such action.

                  (v) Labor and Employee Relations.

                           (i) None of the employees of Parent or any of its
                  Subsidiaries is represented in his or her capacity as an
                  employee of such company by any labor organization; neither
                  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has recognized any labor
                  organization nor has any labor organization been elected as
                  the collective bargaining agent of any of their employees, nor
                  has Parent or any of its


                                       22
<Page>

                  Subsidiaries signed any collective bargaining agreement or
                  union contract recognizing any labor organization as the
                  bargaining agent of any of their employees; and to the
                  Knowledge of Parent, there is no active or current union
                  organization activity involving the employees of Parent or any
                  Subsidiary, nor has there ever been union representation
                  involving employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

                           (ii) Parent and each Subsidiary have made available
                  to the Company or its counsel a description of all written
                  employment policies under which the Parent or any of its
                  Subsidiaries currently operates.

                           (iii) To Parent's Knowledge, Parent and each of its
                  Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Federal, foreign (as
                  applicable), state, or other applicable laws regarding
                  employment practices, including laws relating to workers'
                  safety, sexual harassment or discrimination, except where the
                  failure to so be in compliance, individually or in the
                  aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                           (iv) To the Knowledge of Parent, no employee who is
                  one of the twenty (20) most highly compensated employees of
                  Parent and its Subsidiaries, including base salary but
                  excluding commissions and bonuses based on 2001 base salary,
                  has any plans to terminate his or her employment with Parent
                  or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (w) Transactions with Affiliates. Since the date of Parent's
         last proxy statement to its stockholders filed pursuant to Section 14
         of the Exchange Act (and the rules and regulations thereunder) for the
         sole purpose of convening Parent's annual meeting of stockholders, no
         event or transaction has occurred that would be required to be reported
         by the Parent pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S -K promulgated by
         the SEC.

                  (x) Permits. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold all
         licenses, permits, registrations, orders, authorizations, approvals and
         franchises that are required to permit it to conduct its businesses as
         presently conducted, except where the failure to hold such licenses,
         permits, registrations, orders, authorizations, approvals or franchises
         could not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
         have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. All such licenses, permits,
         registrations, orders, authorizations, approvals and franchises are
         now, and will be immediately after the Effective Time, valid and in
         full force and effect, except where the failure to be valid and in full
         force and effect or to have the benefit of any such license, permit,
         registration, order, authorization, approval or franchise could not
         reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Neither Parent nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has received any written notification of any asserted
         present failure (or past and unremedied failure) by it to have obtained
         any such license, permit, registration, order, authorization, approval
         or franchise, except where such failure could not


                                       23
<Page>

         reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                  (y) Investment Company Act. Neither Parent nor any of its
         Subsidiaries (when taken together as a whole) has been or currently is
         an "investment company" within the meaning of that term as used in the
         Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

                  (z) Board Recommendation. The Board of Directors of Parent, at
         a meeting duly called and held on April 4, 2002, has approved this
         Agreement and (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
         contemplated hereby, including the Merger, taken together are fair to
         and in the best interests of Parent and the stockholders of Parent and
         declared the Merger to be advisable; (ii) approved this Agreement; and
         (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Parent approve the
         issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger and the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (aa) Tax Treatment. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates
         has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other
         circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from
         qualifying as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
         of the Code.

                  (bb) Opinion of Parent Financial Advisor. Parent has received
         the opinion of US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, dated the date of this
         Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the consideration to be
         paid in the Merger by Parent is fair to Parent from a financial point
         of view, a signed copy of which opinion has been delivered to the
         Company, and such opinion has not been amended, modified or revoked in
         a manner adverse to the Company. Parent has been authorized by US
         Bancorp Piper Jaffray to permit the inclusion of such fairness opinion
         (and, subject to prior review and consent by US Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
         a reference thereto) in the Proxy Statement.

                  (cc) Parent Rights Agreement. Parent has made available to
         Company or its counsel a complete and correct copy of the Parent Rights
         Agreement, including all exhibits and amendments thereto. Parent has
         taken, and as soon as practicable after the date hereof, Parent will
         use commercial reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Rights Agent to
         take, all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to amend the
         Rights Agreement to ensure that the execution of this Agreement, the
         Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement will
         not cause (i) Company or any of its Affiliates to be considered an
         Acquiring Person (as defined in the Parent Rights Agreement), (ii) the
         occurrence of the Distribution Date or Stock Acquisition Date (each as
         defined in the Parent Rights Agreement) or (iii) the separation of the
         Parent Rights from the underlying Parent Shares, and will not give the
         holders thereof the right to acquire securities of any party thereto.

                  (dd) Change of Control. No change-of-control or other similar
         provision of any agreement to which Parent or any Subsidiary is a party
         (i) has been triggered by prior


                                       24
<Page>

         issuances of Parent Common Stock or (ii) will be triggered by the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  (ee) Future Operations. The operation of the business of
         Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (individually or taken as a whole) as
         currently conducted or as proposed to be conducted do not and will not
         violate the Consulting and Non-Compete Agreements by and between
         Computer Associates and (i) Andrew Filipkowski, (ii) Michael Cullinane
         or (iii) Paul Humanansky.

                  (ff) WARN Obligation. All reductions in force performed by the
         Parent or any Subsidiary (individually or taken as a whole) have been
         in compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification
         Act.

         5.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the statements contained
in this SECTION 5.2 are true and correct, except to the extent (i) set forth on
the disclosure schedule delivered contemporaneously with this Agreement by
Parent to the Company (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), which statements
shall be deemed to be representations and warranties as if made hereunder, or
(ii) set forth in Company's SEC Reports (as defined herein) filed as of the date
hereof. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections and
paragraphs corresponding to the lettered and numbered paragraphs contained in
this SECTION 5.2, and the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify any
paragraph in this SECTION 5.2 and other paragraphs or sections to which it is
reasonably apparent (from a plain reading of the disclosure) that such
disclosure relates.

                  (a) Corporate Organization and Qualification. Each of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
         incorporation and is qualified and in good standing as a foreign
         corporation in each jurisdiction where the properties owned, leased or
         operated, or the business conducted, by it require such qualification,
         except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing as a
         foreign corporation could not, individually or in the aggregate,
         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.
         Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite power and
         authority (corporate or otherwise) to own its properties and to carry
         on its business as it is now being conducted. Set forth in SECTION
         5.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a listing of each of the
         Subsidiaries of the Company, the jurisdiction of formation of each such
         subsidiary, and a listing of the foreign jurisdictions in which each
         such Subsidiary is qualified. The Company has heretofore delivered or
         made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its certificate
         of incorporation and bylaws and the charter documents of its
         Subsidiaries, each as amended as of the date hereof.

                  (b) Capitalization.

                           (i) The authorized capital stock of the Company
                  consists of (A) 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value

                  (B) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
                  share, 1,000,000 of which have been designated Series A

                  the Company Rights. No shares of preferred stock are issued
                  and outstanding on the date hereof. All of the outstanding
                  shares of capital stock of the Company and its Subsidiaries
                  have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
                  paid and nonassessable. All outstanding shares of capital
                  stock or other equity interests of the Subsidiaries of the
                  Company are owned by the Company or a direct or indirect
                  wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all
                  Encumbrances of any nature.

                           (ii) The Company has no outstanding stock
                  appreciation rights, phantom stock or similar rights. As of
                  the date of this Agreement, except for (A) the Company Rights
                  and (B) options to purchase 316,792 Company Shares issued
                  pursuant to the Company's 1996 Option Plan, options to

                  Company's 1996 Stock Option and 1999 Stock Option Plan the
                  "COMPANY OPTION PLANS"), there are no outstanding or
                  authorized options, warrants, calls, rights (including
                  preemptive rights), commitments or any other agreements of any
                  character which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
                  party to, or may be bound by, allowing it or requiring it to
                  issue, transfer, grant, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire any
                  shares of capital stock or any of its securities or rights
                  convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to
                  subscribe for, any shares of capital stock of the Company or
                  any of its Subsidiaries (the "COMPANY EQUIVALENTS"). Set forth
                  in SECTION 5.2(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is a
                  list, as of April 1, 2002, of the outstanding Company Options,

                  pursuant to which such option was issued, the exercise price
                  of such option, the number of shares as to which such option
                  will have vested at such date and whether the exercisability
                  of such option will be accelerated in any way by the
                  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the extent of
                  acceleration, if any, and any adjustments to such options
                  resulting from the consummation of the transactions

                  Securities Act pursuant to a registration statement on Form
                  S-8, which registration statement has been declared and
                  remains effective. Since December 31, 2001, no Company Options
                  or Company Equivalents have been issued (except as to Company
                  Options issued in the ordinary course of business),
                  accelerated or had their terms materially modified.

                           (iii) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, there
                  are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other

         approval, authorization or permit, or to make such registration, filing
         or notification, could not reasonably be expected to, individually or
         in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or

         bound, except for such violations, breaches and defaults (or rights of
         termination, cancellation or acceleration or lien or other charge or
         encumbrance) which, individually or in the aggregate, could not

         investigations or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the
         Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, or (ii)
         materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to consummate the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor
         any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding judgment, order,
         writ, injunction or decree which (A) has or may have the effect of
         prohibiting or impairing any business practice of the Company or

         intangible) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the conduct of
         the business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or Company's
         ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or (B),
         individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have
         a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. SECTION 5.2(g) of the Company
         Disclosure Schedule lists each action, suit, claim, investigation or

                  (h) SEC Reports; Financial Statements.

                           (i) Except for documents related to the transactions
                  contemplated hereby, the Company has filed all forms, reports
                  and documents and all amendments thereto with the SEC required
                  to be filed by it pursuant to the federal securities laws and
                  the SEC rules and regulations thereunder in effect as of the
                  time of such filing or amendment, all of which when filed
                  complied as to form in all material respects with all
                  applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
                  Act (collectively, the "COMPANY SEC REPORTS") and all of which
                  are available through EDGAR. None of the Company SEC Reports,
                  including, without limitation, any financial statements or
                  schedules included therein, at the time filed (or if amended,
                  supplemented or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
                  this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contained any
                  untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
                  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
                  order to make the statements therein, in light of the
                  circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
                  of the Company's Subsidiaries is required to file any forms,
                  reports or other documents with the SEC.

                           (ii) When filed with the SEC, the consolidated
                  balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
                  income, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flow
                  (including the related notes thereto) of the Company included
                  in the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "COMPANY
                  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") complied as to form in all material
                  respects with GAAP and the published rules and regulations of
                  the SEC with respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with
                  GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout, or for, the
                  periods set forth therein (except in the case of unaudited
                  interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC
                  on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act), and presented fairly, in
                  all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
                  the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of their
                  respective dates, and the consolidated results of their
                  operations and their cash flow for the periods presented
                  therein, except that the unaudited interim financial
                  statements do not include footnote disclosure of the type
                  associated with audited financial statements and were or are
                  subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which
                  were not or are not expected to be material in amount, type or
                  effect.

                           (iii) Since December 31, 2001, there has not been any
                  material change, by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
                  accounting principles, methods or


                                       29
<Page>

                  policies, except as required by GAAP. There are no material
                  amendments or modifications to agreements, documents or other
                  instruments which previously had been filed by the Company
                  with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
                  Act, which have not been filed with the SEC but which are
                  required to be filed.

                  (i) No Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of its
         Subsidiaries has any indebtedness, obligations or liabilities of any
         kind (whether accrued, absolute, or contingent, and whether due or to
         become due or asserted or unasserted), and, to the Knowledge of the
         Company, there is no reasonable basis for the assertion of any claim
         with respect to any indebtedness, obligation or liability of any nature
         against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for
         indebtedness, obligations and liabilities (i) which are fully reflected
         in, adequately reserved against or otherwise described in the most
         recent Company Financial Statements, (ii) which have been incurred
         after the most recent Company Financial Statements in the ordinary
         course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) which are
         obligations to perform under executory contracts in the ordinary course
         of business (none of which is a liability resulting from a breach of
         contract or warranty, tort, infringement or legal action) or (iv)
         except as otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to (i)-(iii)
         above which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                  (j) Absence of Certain Changes of Events. Except for actions
         expressly contemplated by this Agreement, since December 31, 2001, the
         Company and each Subsidiary has conducted its business only in the
         ordinary course and, since such date, there has not been (i) any
         Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (ii) any damage, destruction or
         loss of assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or
         not covered by insurance) that has had or could reasonably be expected
         to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
         the Company; (iii) any material revaluation by the Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries of any of its assets, including, without limitation,
         writing down the value of capitalized software or inventory or deferred
         tax assets or writing off notes or accounts receivable other than in
         the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; or (iv)
         or other action or event that would have required the consent of Parent
         pursuant to SECTION 6.1 had such action or event occurred after the
         date of this Agreement.

                  (k) Brokers and Finders. Except for the fees and expenses
         payable to Robertson Stephens, Inc., which fees and expenses are
         determined pursuant to its agreement with the Company, dated December
         7, 2001, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has employed
         any investment banker, broker, finder, consultant or intermediary in
         connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which
         would be entitled to any investment banking, brokerage, finder's or
         similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (l) S-4 Registration Statement and Proxy Statement. None of
         the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion
         or incorporation by reference in the S-4 Registration Statement or the
         Proxy Statement will in the case of the Proxy Statement, at the time of
         the mailing of the Proxy


                                       30
<Page>

         Statement, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent
         Stockholders Meeting, and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
         statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
         made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
         event with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their
         respective affiliates, officers and directors should occur which is
         required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the
         Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent, so that such
         event may be so described and such amendment or supplement promptly
         filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the
         stockholders of the Company and Parent, if necessary. The Proxy
         Statement will (with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries)
         comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
         Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
         representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by,
         or related to, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their affiliates or
         advisors which is contained in any of the foregoing documents.

                  (m) Taxes.

                           (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
                  timely filed (after taking into account any extensions to
                  file) all material federal, state, local and foreign Returns
                  required by applicable Tax law to be filed by the Company and
                  each of its Subsidiaries. All such Returns are true and
                  correct in all material respects and have been completed in
                  accordance with applicable law. All Taxes owed by the Company
                  or any of its Subsidiaries have been paid other than Taxes in
                  an aggregate amount that would not be material to Company and
                  its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Other than any reserve for
                  deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
                  between book and Tax treatment, the Company has made accruals
                  for Taxes on the Company Financial Statements which are
                  adequate to cover any Tax liability of the Company and each of
                  its Subsidiaries determined in accordance with GAAP through
                  the date of the most recent of Company Financial Statements
                  other than accruals for Taxes in an aggregate amount that
                  would not be material to Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
                  as a whole, and has not incurred any Tax liability since the
                  date of the most recent Company Financial Statements other
                  than in the ordinary course of business. To the Company's
                  Knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for the assertion of
                  any claims for Taxes that if adversely determined would be
                  material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the
                  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

                           (ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
                  withheld with respect to its employees, creditors, independent
                  contractors, stockholders or other parties all Taxes required
                  to be withheld and has timely paid over such Taxes to the
                  appropriate Governmental Authority.

<Page>

                           (iii) There is no Tax deficiency outstanding,
                  assessed, or to the Company's Knowledge, proposed against the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
                  any of its Subsidiaries has executed or requested any waiver
                  of any statute of limitations on or extending the period for
                  the assessment or collection of any Tax that is still in
                  effect. There are no liens for Taxes on the assets of Company
                  or of any of its Subsidiaries other than with respect to Taxes
                  not yet due and payable.

                  that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
                  subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

                           (v) No Tax audit or other examination of the Company
                  or any of its Subsidiaries is presently in progress, nor has
                  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been notified either in
                  writing or orally of any request for any such Tax audit or
                  other examination.

                           (vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  has filed any consent agreement under Section 341(f) of the
                  Code or agreed to have Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to
                  any disposition of a subsection (f) asset (as defined in
                  Section 341(f)(4) of the Code) owned by the Company.

                           (vii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  is a party to (A) any agreement with a party other than the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for the
                  allocation or payment of Tax liabilities or payment for Tax
                  benefits with respect to a consolidated, combined or unitary
                  Return which Return includes or included the Company or any
                  Subsidiary or (B) any Company Significant Tax Agreement other
                  than any Company Significant Tax Agreement described in (A).

                           (viii) Except for the group of which the Company and
                  its Subsidiaries are now presently members, neither the
                  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever been a member of
                  an "affiliated group" of corporations within the meaning of
                  Section 1504 of the Code. None of the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any person
                  (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) under
                  Treasury Regulationss. 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
                  state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor,
                  by contract, or otherwise. There is no excess loss account,
                  deferred intercompany gain or loss, or intercompany items as
                  such terms are defined in the regulations promulgated under
                  the Code, that exist with respect to the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries.

                           (ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
                  is a party to any joint venture, partnership or, to the
                  Company's Knowledge, any other arrangement or contract, that
                  could be treated as a partnership for federal income tax
                  purposes.

                           (x) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be
                  required to include any item of income in, or exclude any item
                  of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
                  portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of
                  any: (A) change in method of accounting for a taxable period
                  ending on or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481 of
                  the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
                  local or foreign income Tax law); or (B) "closing agreement"
                  as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding

                  law) executed on or prior to the Closing Date.

                           (xi) There is no contract, agreement, plan or
                  arrangement covering any individual or entity treated as an
                  individual included in the business or assets of the Company
                  or its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, could
                  give rise to the payment of any "excess parachute payments"
                  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, by the
                  Company, a Subsidiary, Merger Sub or Parent or any payment

                  property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section
                  897(c)(2) of the Code. None of the Company or any of its

                  issued would be, binding on the Company or any of its
                  Subsidiaries.

                           (xiv) In the past five (5) years, none of the Company
                  or its Subsidiaries has distributed a corporation in a
                  transaction that is reported to qualify under Section 355 of
                  the Code, or been distributed in a transaction that is

                  the Company pursuant to Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414
                  of the Code. The Company has provided or made available to
                  Parent or its counsel current copies of all employee manuals
                  of the Company and its Subsidiaries that include personnel

                  summary plan description and summary of material modifications
                  thereto with respect to each such plan and Form 5310. Section
                  5.2(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
                  description of the material terms of any material unwritten
                  Company Scheduled Plan as currently in effect as of the date
                  hereof.

                           (iii) To the Company's Knowledge, as of the date
                  hereof, each Company Scheduled Plan (1) has been in material
                  compliance in form and in operation with the material,
                  applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code, and any other
                  material legal requirements; and (2) has been and is operated
                  and administered in compliance with its terms (except as
                  otherwise required by law). Each Company Scheduled Plan which
                  is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
                  has received, or has remaining a period of time to apply for,
                  a favorable determination letter or other recognition of
                  exemption from the Internal Revenue Service on which the
                  Company can rely.

                           (iv) With respect to each Company Scheduled Plan,
                  there are no claims or other proceedings pending or, to the
                  Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to the
                  assets thereof (other than routine claims for benefits).

                           (v) To the Company's Knowledge, each Company
                  Scheduled Plan (other than any stock option plan) may be
                  amended, terminated, modified or otherwise revised by the
                  Company or Parent, on and after the Closing, without further
                  liability to the Company or Parent (other than ordinary
                  administrative expenses or routine claims for benefit plans).

                  Company Plan Affiliate has at any time participated in, made
                  contributions to or had any other liability, including
                  contingent liability, with respect to any Company Scheduled
                  Plan which is a "multi-employer plan" as defined in Section
                  4001 of ERISA, a "multi-employer plan" within the meaning of
                  Section 3(37) of ERISA, a "multiple employer plan" within the
                  meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code, a "multiple employer

                           (vii) No Company Scheduled Plan provides, or reflects
                  or represents any liability to provide retiree health coverage
                  to any person for any reason, except as may be required by
                  COBRA or applicable state insurance laws, and neither the
                  Company nor any Company Plan Affiliate has any liability
                  (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and
                  whether due or to become due to asserted or unasserted) to any
                  current or former employee, or director (either individually
                  or as a group) to provide retiree health coverage, except to
                  the extent required by applicable continuation coverage
                  statutes, laws or ordinances.

                           (viii) With respect to any Company Scheduled Plan
                  which is a welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
                  there is no disqualified benefit (as such term is defined in
                  Code Section 4976(b)) which would subject the Company or any
                  Company Plan Affiliate to a tax under Code Section 4976(a).

                           (ix) Other than by reason of actions taken following
                  the Closing, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the
                  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement will (1) entitle any current or former employee of
                  the Company to a material amount of (i) severance pay, (ii)
                  unemployment compensation or (iii) any other payment, (2)

                  (other than for a terminated or frozen tax-qualified plan,
                  pursuant to a requirement herein to freeze or terminate such
                  plan), cause the forgiveness of any indebtedness, or increase
                  the amount of any compensation due to any such employee or
                  former employee or (3) give rise to the payment of any amount
                  that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section

                           (x) The Company has not entered into any contract,
                  agreement or arrangement covering any employee that gives rise
                  to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
                  pursuant to the terms of Section 162(m) of the Code.

                  Software) used, sold, distributed or licensed in or as a part
                  of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries as

                  where the failure to so be in compliance, individually or in
                  the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
                  Company.

                           (iv) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
                  Company Key Employees has any plans to terminate his or her
                  employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  (v) Permits. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all
         licenses, permits, registrations, orders, authorizations, approvals and
         franchises that are required to permit it to conduct its businesses as
         presently conducted, except where the failure to hold such licenses,
         permits, registrations, orders, authorizations, approvals or franchises
         could not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
         have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries. All such licenses, permits, registrations, orders,
         authorizations, approvals and franchises are now, and will be
         immediately after the Effective Time, valid and in full force and
         effect, except where the failure to be valid and in full force and
         effect or to have the benefit of any such license, permit,
         registration, order, authorization, approval or franchise could not
         reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Material Adverse Effect on the


                                       41
<Page>

         Company or the Surviving Corporation. Neither the Company nor any of
         its Subsidiaries has received any written notification of any asserted
         present failure (or past and unremedied failure) by it to have obtained
         any such license, permit, registration, order, authorization, approval
         or franchise, except where such failure could not reasonably be
         expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
         Effect on the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

                  (w) Transactions with Affiliates. Since the date of Company's
         last proxy statement to its stockholders filed pursuant to Section 14
         of the Exchange Act (and the rules and regulations thereunder) for the
         sole purpose of convening the Company's annual meeting of stockholders,
         no event or transaction has occurred that would be required to be
         reported by the Company, pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K
         promulgated by the SEC.

                  (x) Board Recommendation. The Board of Directors of the
         Company, at a meeting duly called and held on April 4, 2002, has
         approved this Agreement and (i) determined that this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, taken together
         are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the
         Company and declared the Merger to be advisable; (ii) approved this
         Agreement; and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
         Company adopt this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
         contemplated hereby.

                  (y) Tax Treatment. Neither the Company nor any of its
         affiliates has taken any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan
         or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
         from qualifying as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
         368(a) of the Code.

                  (z) Opinion of Company Financial Advisor. The Company has
         received the opinion of Robertson Stephens, Inc., dated the date of
         this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio
         is fair to the holders of the Company Shares from a financial point of
         view, a signed copy of which opinion has been delivered to Parent, and
         such opinion has not been amended, modified or revoked in a manner
         adverse to Parent. Subject to prior review and consent by Robertson
         Stephens, Inc., the Company has been authorized by Robertson Stephens,
         Inc. to permit the inclusion of such fairness opinion and a reference
         thereto in the Proxy Statement.

                  (aa) Company Rights Agreement. The Company has made available
         to Parent or its counsel a complete and correct copy of the Company
         Rights Agreement, including all exhibits and amendments thereto. The
         Company has taken, and as soon as practicable after the date hereof the
         Company will use commercial reasonable efforts to cause the Company
         Rights Agent to take, all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate
         to amend the Rights Agreement to ensure that the execution of this
         Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in this
         Agreement will not cause (i) Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
         affiliates to be considered an Acquiring Person (as defined in the
         Company Rights Agreement), (ii) the occurrence of the Distribution Date
         or Shares Acquisition Date (each as defined in the Company Rights
         Agreement) or (iii) the


                                       42
<Page>

         separation of the Rights from the underlying Company Shares, and will
         not give the holders thereof the right to acquire securities of any
         party thereto.

                  (bb) WARN Obligation. All reductions in force performed by the
         Company or any Subsidiary (individually or taken as a whole) have been
         in compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification
         Act.

         merger, share exchange or acquisition of assets of such Person) or
         enter into any joint venture or similar strategic or collaborative
         arrangement (each a "TRANSACTION"), except in connection with any
         Transaction in which: (A) the total number of shares of Parent capital
         stock issued or issuable (upon conversion or otherwise) will not
         require the approval of Parent's stockholders; (B) the fair market
         value of any assets (excluding Parent capital stock) delivered or to be
         delivered (including the aggregate value of any licensing fees,
         royalties or other payments due from Parent or any Subsidiary) under
         such arrangement will not exceed 10% of the market capitalization of
         Parent, as determined on the date of execution of such arrangement; (C)
         the combined value of (A) and (B) will not exceed 20% of the market
         capitalization of Parent (each value as determined on the date of
         execution of such arrangement); (D) the Transaction will not result in
         the acquisition of a "significant subsidiary" as such term is defined
         in Section 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X; and (E) such arrangement has no
         less than a cash flow neutral effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole, based upon the combined financial forecasts of Parent
         and such entity, as of the date of execution of such arrangement;
         provided; that the financial projections of Parent must not be
         inconsistent with the financial projections provided to the Company as
         of the date hereof;

                  (d) Incur any material indebtedness for borrowed money (other
         than trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business
         consistent with past practice and owed to persons other than an
         Affiliate of Parent or any Subsidiary) or guarantee any such prohibited
         indebtedness or issue or sell warrants or rights to acquire debt
         securities of Parent or any Subsidiary or guarantee any indebtedness of
         others;

                  (e) Except as required by law, outstanding written agreements,
         or any Parent Scheduled Plans existing, on the date hereof and as
         previously disclosed to the Company or its counsel, adopt or materially
         amend or modify any Parent Scheduled Plan or materially increase the
         salaries, wage rates or material benefits or perquisites (including,
         without limitation, travel and entertainment reimbursement policies) of
         any of its


                                       48
<Page>

         executive officers or directors (other than in the ordinary course of
         business consistent with past practice), including but not limited to
         (but without limiting the generality of the foregoing), adopting or
         materially amending any stock purchase or option plan, entering into
         any employment contract paying any bonus, commission or special
         remuneration increasing any commission plans or initiating any sales
         incentives involving increased commission or other material benefits to
         any director or officers other than in connection with the hiring of
         any executive officers after the date hereof;

                  (f) Except for any change which is required by reason of a
         change in GAAP, change any material method of accounting or accounting
         practice used by it; or

                  (g) Settle at less than the full stated value, compromise or
         discount any receivables of Parent or any Subsidiary, other than in the
         ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;

                  (h) Other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
         with past practice, defer or fail to timely pay any payment obligation
         of Parent or any Subsidiary;

                  (i) Take, or agree to take, any of the actions described in
         SECTION 6.2(a) through (h) above, or any action which would cause or
         would be reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to the Merger
         set forth in SECTIONS 7.1 or 7.2, not to be satisfied.

         6.3      No Solicitation.

                  (a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the
         Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
         accordance with its terms, the Company will not, and will not permit
         any of its Subsidiaries to, and will direct its and their respective
         directors, officers, investment bankers, affiliates, representatives
         and agents (collectively, the "REPRESENTATIVES") not to, (i) solicit,
         initiate, or intentionally encourage (including by way of furnishing
         information or affording access to the properties, books or records of
         the Company), or take any other action intended to facilitate, any
         inquiries or proposals that constitute, or could reasonably be expected
         to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) engage in, or
         enter into, any negotiations or discussions concerning any Company
         Acquisition Proposal. In the event that (x) the Company receives a
         Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
         determines in good faith is or may reasonably be expected to lead to a
         Company Superior Proposal that was not solicited by the Company or
         otherwise obtained in violation of this SECTION 6.3, and (y) after the
         Company gives Parent written notice of its intention to do so, the
         Company may, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
         good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that
         failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
         Board of Directors of the Company under applicable law, provide such
         non-public information, afford such access and enter into and engage in
         negotiations and discussions regarding any Company Acquisition
         Proposal. In such event, the Company shall, (i) promptly (and no less
         than twenty-four (24) hours prior to providing such non-public
         information, affording such access or


                                       49
<Page>

         entering into and engaging in any such negotiations and discussions)
         inform Parent of the material terms and conditions of such Company
         Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the Person making such
         Company Acquisition Proposal (if not prohibited from doing so under any
         confidentiality agreement in effect as of the date hereof) and (ii)
         thereafter promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of the status,
         including any material change to the terms, of any such Company
         Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, the term "COMPANY ACQUISITION
         PROPOSAL" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer believed by the
         Company to being bona fide relating to any (i) merger, consolidation,
         business combination, or similar transaction involving the Company,
         (ii) sale, lease or other disposition, directly or indirectly, of all
         or a substantial portion of the assets of the Company and its
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole in one or more transactions, (iii)
         issuance, sale, or other disposition of a majority of the voting equity
         securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase such securities,
         or securities convertible into such securities) of the Company, (iv)
         liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other similar type of
         transaction with respect to the Company, (v) tender offer or exchange
         offer for a majority of the voting equity securities of the Company or
         (vi) other transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose
         to any of the foregoing transactions; in the case of (i), (ii), (iii),
         (iv) or (v) above, which transaction would result in a third party (or
         its stockholders) acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting
         power of, or economic interest in, the Company or the assets
         representing more than fifty percent (50%) of the net income, net
         revenue or assets of the Company on a consolidated basis; provided,
         however, that the term "COMPANY ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall not include
         the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of
         this Agreement, "COMPANY SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any Company
         Acquisition Proposal made by a third party on terms which the Board of
         Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consulting
         with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
         considering such other matters that it deems relevant) would, if
         consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to the Company's
         stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and, taking
         into account, in the reasonable good faith judgment of the Board of
         Directors of the Company after consultation with its financial advisor,
         the availability to the person or entity making such Company Superior
         Proposal of the financial means to conclude such transaction. The
         Company will immediately cease any and all existing activities,
         discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
         respect to any of the foregoing. The Company shall be responsible for
         the conduct of its Representatives in accordance with this SECTION
         6.3(a), and any conduct by a Representative that would constitute a
         breach of the provisions of this SECTION 6.3(a) if engaged in by the
         Company shall be deemed a breach of this SECTION 6.3(a) by the
         Company.

                  (b) Except as permitted by this SECTION 6.3, neither the Board
         of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
         withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or propose publicly
         to withdraw, or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
         recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company or such
         committee of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve, recommend, or
         otherwise publicly endorse any Company Acquisition Proposal,(iii)
         render the provisions of any anti-takeover statute, rule or regulation
         inapplicable to any person or group (other than


                                       50
<Page>

         Parent, Merger Sub or their affiliates) or to any Company Acquisition
         Proposal, or (iv) cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
         agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement with
         respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, except in each case to the
         extent that the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
         thereof shall determine in good faith (after consultation with its
         outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
         with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company
         under applicable law. Nothing contained in this SECTION 6.3 shall
         prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company or any
         committee thereof from taking, and disclosing to its stockholders, a
         position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the
         Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the Company's
         stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
         thereof shall determine in good faith (after consultation with its
         outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
         with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company
         under applicable law, provided, however, that neither the Company nor
         its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or
         modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
         to Parent, its position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or
         approve or recommend or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a
         Company Acquisition Proposal unless and until the Company shall have
         complied with its obligations under this Section 6.3.

                  (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
         paragraphs (a) and (b) of this SECTION 6.3, the Company will promptly
         (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) advise Parent, orally
         and in writing, if any Company Acquisition Proposal is made, or any
         non-public information or access to the properties, books or records of
         the Company is requested in connection with a Company Acquisition
         Proposal. Any disclosure by the Company pursuant to the first sentence
         of this SECTION 6.3(c) will include a reasonably detailed summary of
         the principal terms and conditions of any such Company Acquisition
         Proposal and, if not prohibited by any confidentiality agreement in
         effect as of the date hereof, will disclose any written materials
         received by the Company in connection with such Company Acquisition
         Proposal and the identity of the party making such Company Acquisition
         Proposal, or inquiry. The Company will keep Parent reasonably advised
         of the status and details (including amendments and proposed
         amendments) of any such request or Company Acquisition Proposal.

         6.4      MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS.

                  (a) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall take all
         action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of
         incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of stockholders ("COMPANY
         STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") to be held as promptly as practicable after the
         S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC for the
         purposes of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger. Nothing herein
         shall prevent the Company from adjourning or postponing the Company
         Stockholders Meeting if there are insufficient Company Shares necessary
         to conduct business at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Unless the
         Company's Board of Directors or any committee


                                       51
<Page>

         thereof has withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this Agreement
         and the Merger in compliance with SECTION 6.3, the Company shall use
         its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
         favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and shall take
         all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent
         of stockholders required by the DGCL or NNM requirements to obtain such
         adoption. The Company shall take all other action necessary or
         advisable to promptly and expeditiously secure any vote or consent of
         stockholders required by applicable law, the NNM and the Company's
         certificate of incorporation and bylaws to effect the Merger.

                  (b) Promptly after the date hereof, Parent shall take all
         action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of
         incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of stockholders (the
         "PARENT STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") to be held as promptly as practicable
         after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC
         for the purposes of voting upon the issuance of Parent Shares in
         connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
         hereby. Nothing herein shall prevent Parent from adjourning or
         postponing the Parent Stockholders Meeting if there are insufficient
         shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to conduct business at the
         Parent Stockholders Meeting. Neither the Board of Directors of Parent
         nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose publicly
         to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the approval
         or recommendation by the Board of Directors of Parent or such committee
         of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger
         and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent
         that the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof shall
         determine in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
         counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
         fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Parent under applicable
         law. Nothing contained in this SECTION 6.4(b) shall prohibit Parent or
         the Board of Directors of Parent from making any disclosure to Parent's
         stockholders if the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee
         thereof shall determine in good faith (after consultation with its
         outside legal counsel), that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
         with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Parent under
         applicable law. Unless Parent's Board of Directors or any committee
         thereof has withdrawn or modified its recommendation of the issuance of
         Parent Shares in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
         contemplated hereby in compliance with this SECTION 6.4(b), Parent
         shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders
         proxies in favor of the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with
         the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall
         take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
         consent of stockholders required by the DGCL or NNM requirements to
         obtain such approval. Parent shall take all other action necessary or
         advisable to promptly and expeditiously secure any vote or consent of
         stockholders required by applicable law, the NNM and Parent's
         certificate of incorporation and bylaws to effect the Merger, including
         the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger and the
         other transactions contemplated hereby.

         6.5 REGISTRATION STATEMENT. Parent will, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-4 (the "S-4 REGISTRATION STATEMENT"), containing a joint proxy
statement/prospectus and forms of proxy, in


                                       52
<Page>

connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent
Shares issuable in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent will, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy statement
that will be the same joint proxy statement/prospectus contained in the S-4
Registration Statement and forms of proxy, in connection with the vote of the
Company's and Parent's stockholders with respect to the Merger or the
issuance of Parent Shares in connection therewith, as applicable (such joint
proxy statement/prospectus, together with any amendments thereof or
supplements thereto, in each case in the form or forms mailed to the
Company's and Parent's stockholders is herein called the "PROXY STATEMENT").
Each of the Company and Parent will, and will cause its respective
accountants, lawyers and investment bankers or financial advisors to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the S-4 Registration Statement to be
declared effective by the SEC (the date the S-4 Registration Statement is
declared effective being referred to as the "S-4 EFFECTIVE DATE") as promptly
as practicable thereafter, including, without limitation, causing its
respective accountants, lawyers and investment bankers or financial advisors
to deliver necessary or required instruments such as opinions, consents and
certificates, and will take or will cause its respective accountants and
lawyers to take, any other action required or necessary to be taken or
advisable or customary under federal or state securities laws or otherwise in
connection with the registration process, it being understood and agreed that
each of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati Professional Corporation, counsel to
the Company, and Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman, counsel to Parent, will
render, on the date the preliminary Proxy Statement is first filed with the
SEC or on the date of any amendment thereto so long as it is rendered prior
to the date on which the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective, an
opinion that the federal income tax consequences described in the
Registration Statement are true and correct in all material respects. Each of
the Company and Parent will use its reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and the applicable form of proxy to be mailed to its stockholders
at the earliest practicable date after the S-4 Effective Date and each of the
Company and Parent shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the
case may be, as soon as practicable thereafter (subject to the requirements
of laws and rules and regulations of the SEC). Parent shall also take any
action required to be taken under state blue sky or other securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger.

         6.6 REASONABLE EFFORTS. Each of the Parties shall: (a) promptly make
its respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under
all applicable laws with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; and (b) use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or appropriate to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable.

         6.7 ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                  (a) Upon reasonable notice, Parent, on the one hand, and the
         Company, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause each of their
         Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, counsel, accountants
         and other authorized representatives of the other such party (the
         "AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES") reasonable access, during normal business
         hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to their
         properties, assets, books


                                       53
<Page>

         and records and, during such period, shall (and shall cause each of
         their Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to such Authorized
         Representatives all information concerning its business, properties,
         assets and personnel as may reasonably be requested for purposes of
         appropriate and necessary due diligence, provided that no investigation
         pursuant to this SECTION 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to modify any of
         the representations or warranties made by the Parties. The Parties each
         agree to treat (and cause their Authorized Representatives to treat)
         any and all information provided pursuant to this SECTION 6.7 in
         compliance with the terms of that certain Confidentiality Agreement,
         entered by and between the Company and Parent, dated February 10, 2002
         (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

                  (b) Parent and the Company shall keep each other reasonably
         apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
         transactions contemplated hereby and work cooperatively in connection
         with obtaining all required approvals or consents of any governmental
         authority (whether domestic, foreign or supranational). In that regard,
         each Party shall without limitation: (i) promptly notify the other of,
         and if in writing, furnish the other with the copies of (or, in the
         case of material oral communications, advise the other orally of) any
         communications from or with any governmental authority (whether
         domestic, foreign or supranational) with respect to the Merger or any
         of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) permit
         the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
         the views of the other in connection with, any proposed filings or any
         written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
         governmental authority, (iii) not participate in any meeting with any
         such governmental authority unless it consults with the other in
         advance and to the extent permitted by such governmental authority
         gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and
         (iv) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence, filing and
         communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
         between it and any such governmental authority with respect to this
         Agreement and the Merger.

                  (c) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
         other party in writing of:

                           (i) any notice or other communication from any Person
                  alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
                  in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement if the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case
                  may be, to obtain such consent would have a Material Adverse
                  Effect on Company or Parent as applicable or to the
                  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

                           (ii) any notice or other communication from any
                  governmental or regulatory agency or authority in connection
                  with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

                           (iii) any notice (written or oral) or Knowledge of
                  the occurrence of any event which will, or is reasonably
                  likely to, result in the failure to satisfy any of the

                  (d) The Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other
         Party of any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
         commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
         involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries
         which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement.

         6.8 PUBLICITY. The Parties agree that they will consult with each other
concerning any proposed press release or public announcement pertaining to the
Merger in order to agree upon the text of any such press release or the making
of such public announcement, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with a national securities exchange or
national automated quotation system, in which case the Party proposing to issue
such press release or make such public announcement shall use reasonable efforts
to consult in good faith with the other Party before issuing any such press
release or making any such public announcement. The Parties will prepare a joint
press release for the announcement of the execution of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Board of Directors of Parent or
the Company withdraws its recommendation of this Agreement in compliance
herewith, neither Party will be required to consult with or obtain the agreement
of the other in connection with any press release or public announcement.

         6.9 AFFILIATES OF THE COMPANY. The Company has identified the Persons
listed on SECTION 6.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as persons whom the
Company reasonably believes are "affiliates" of the Company for purposes of Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act (each, a "COMPANY AFFILIATE"). The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable from each Company Affiliate a written agreement in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B (the "COMPANY AFFILIATE LETTER") that such Company Affiliate
will not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Parent Shares issued
to such Company Affiliate pursuant to the Merger, except in compliance with Rule
145 promulgated under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act.

         6.10 MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. Between the date hereof and through the
Effective Time, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all presently existing policies of insurance of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or insurance reasonably comparable to the coverage
afforded by such policies.

         6.11 FILINGS; OTHER ACTION. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, the Parties shall: (a) promptly after the date hereof make their
respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under the
HSR Act, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and comparable foreign laws,
rules and regulations, with respect to the Merger; (b) cooperate in the
preparation of such filings or submissions to the extent required under the HSR
Act, the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and comparable foreign laws, rules
and regulations; and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts promptly to take,
or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or appropriate under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
soon as practicable. Each Party shall bear their own costs and expenses as to
the


                                       55
<Page>

actions set forth in (a)-(c) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, nothing in this Agreement will require Parent, whether
pursuant to an order of the Federal Trade Commission or the United States
Department of Justice or otherwise, to dispose of any material assets, lines of
business or equity interests in order to obtain the consent of the Federal Trade
Commission or the United States Department of Justice to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

         6.12 TAX FREE REORGANIZATION TREATMENT. The Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not
knowingly take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would
jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the
Company (i) shall not file any Return or take any position inconsistent with the
treatment of the Merger as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the
Code, and (ii) shall comply with the record keeping and information reporting
requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation ss. 1.368-3. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the opinion of its tax counsel in such form and upon such
matters as described in SECTION 7.2 or 7.3, as applicable.

         6.13 INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the
         Surviving Corporation will fulfill and honor in all respects the
         obligations of the Company to indemnify and hold harmless the Company's
         and its Subsidiaries' present and former directors, officers,
         employees, and agents and their heirs, executors and assigns
         (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PERSONNEL") against all claims, losses,
         liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and fees, costs and expenses,
         including attorneys' fees and disbursements and amounts paid in
         settlement, incurred in connection with any threatened or pending
         claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
         criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
         to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Personnel is or was an officer,
         director, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
         or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
         (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
         hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
         Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.

                  (b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
         Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
         indemnification and elimination of liability for monetary damages at
         least as favorable to the Indemnified Personnel as those set forth in
         the current certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, and
         for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, those provisions
         will not be repealed or amended or otherwise modified in any manner
         that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified
         Personnel, except to the extent, if any, that such modification is
         required by applicable law.

                  (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
         Parent and the Surviving Corporation will either (i) maintain in
         effect, if available, directors' and officers' liability insurance
         covering those persons who are currently covered by the Company's
         directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms comparable
         to those applicable to the current directors and officers of the
         Company; provided, however, that in no event will Parent and the
         Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the
         annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (or such
         coverage as is available for such 200% of such annual premium), or (ii)
         if mutually agreed between the Company and Parent prior to the Closing,
         purchase a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms
         comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of
         the Company covering all periods prior to the Effective Time.

                  (d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or
         any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
         merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
         surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or
         (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
         any person in a single transaction or a series of transactions, then,
         and in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
         applicable, shall make or cause to be made proper provision so that the
         successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
         applicable, assume the indemnification obligations of Parent or the
         Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this SECTION 6.13 for the
         benefit of the Indemnified Personnel.

                  (e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
         under this SECTION 6.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such a
         manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Personnel to whom this
         SECTION 6.13 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified
         Personnel (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Personnel to
         whom this SECTION 6.13 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
         this SECTION 6.13) unless such modification or termination is required
         by law.

         6.14 COMPANY ESPP. Any offering underway as of May 15, 2002 or that is
scheduled to end on such date under the Company ESPP shall, to the extent
necessary, be accelerated such that on May 15, 2002 all offerings under the
Company ESPP shall be determined by treating this date as the last day of such
offering periods (and making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary
to reflect the shortened offering). Outstanding rights to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock shall be exercised in accordance with the terms of the
ESPP. The Company ESPP shall remain in effect until otherwise terminated by the
Company's Board of Directors; provided, however, that, the Company will not
permit an offering period to commence after the date hereof (unless this
Agreement is terminated) and provided further, that, in the event the Merger is
consummated, the Company ESPP shall be terminated effective as of the Effective
Time.

Employees (and their dependents) prior to the Effective Time ("COMPANY
PARTICIPANT") "and that any benefits provided to Continuing Employees whose
employment is terminated within 18 months following the Effective Date pursuant
to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) shall not
be less favorable than such benefits provided to terminating employees of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Date." Each participant (including

all purposes (including without limitation) for eligibility to participate and

similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such
Company Participants and their eligible dependents and shall provide them with

Parent ESPP. Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure such Continuing
Employee's participation in such plans of the Effective Time.

         materiality or the absence of a Material Adverse Effect contained in
         such representations and warranties), it being understood that for
         purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations or

         such opinion to the Company. The Company agrees to make such
         reasonable representations as may be requested by tax counsel in
         connection with the opinions referred to above; and

                  (g) the Alliance Agreement by and between Parent and Microsoft

Effective Time of the following conditions, any or all of which may be waived in
whole or in part by Parent to the extent permitted by applicable law:

                  (a) the representations and warranties of Company set forth in
         SECTION 5.2 shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of
         this Agreement and as of the Effective Time with the same force and
         effect as if made on and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent
         expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
         date), except (i) for such failures to be true and correct which,
         individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect (without for this purpose giving effect
         to qualifications or limitations as to materiality or the absence of a
         Material Adverse Effect contained in such representations and
         warranties), PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Material Adverse Effect
         qualifier shall be inapplicable with respect to the representations and
         warranties of Company contained in SECTIONS 5.2(a),


                                       62

         (b) AND (d), each of which individually shall be true and correct in
         all material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the
         Effective Time with the same force and effect as if made on and as of
         the Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
         earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), and (ii) as
         otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, it being understood
         that for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations
         and warranties any update or modification to the Company Disclosure
         Schedule made or purported to have been made without Parent's written
         consent thereto shall be disregarded;

                  (b) the Company shall have performed or complied with in all
         material respects its agreements and covenants required to be performed
         or complied with under this Agreement as of or prior to the Effective
         Time;

                  (c) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate
         of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the
         effect that each of the conditions specified in SECTION 7.1 (as it
         relates to the Company) and clauses (a) and (b) of this SECTION 7.3 has
         been satisfied in all respects;

                  (d) Parent shall have received an opinion of Katten Muchin
         Zavis Rosenman, its tax counsel, in form and substance reasonable
         satisfactory to it, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that the
         Merger will constitute a reorganization for United States federal
         income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code;
         provided, however, that if Katten Muchin Zavis Rosenman does not render
         such opinion, this condition shall nonetheless be deemed to be
         satisfied with respect to Parent and Merger Sub if Wilson Sonsini
         Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, renders such opinion to
         Parent. Parent agrees to make such reasonable representations as may be
         requested by tax counsel in connection with the opinions referred to
         above; and

                  (e) the Company shall have received all written consents,
         assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates set forth in
         SECTION 7.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

         occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
         constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

                  (b) if any Restraint shall be in effect and shall have become
         final and nonappealable; provided, that the Party seeking to terminate

         (iii) the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof shall
         have resolved to do any of the foregoing; or

                  (c) for the purpose of accepting a Company Superior Proposal;
         provided, that such termination under this Section 8.2(c) shall not be

         Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability
         or obligation on the part of the Parties or their respective
         affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders, except (x) with
         respect to the treatment of confidential information pursuant to
         SECTION 6.6, the payment of expenses pursuant to SECTION 9.1, and
         Article IX generally, (y) to the extent that such termination results
         from a breach of a Party of any of its covenants or agreements in this
         Agreement or (z) with respect to any intentional misrepresentations in
         connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
         contemplated hereby.

         Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent (i) pursuant to
         SECTION 8.2(c), or (ii) pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a) due to the Company
         Stockholders Meeting not occurring as a result of a Company Acquisition
         Proposal, then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than
         the fifth (5th) business day after the later to occur of such
         termination or the receipt of the Parent Fees and Expenses Statement
         referred to below, pay to Parent an amount equal to the out-of-pocket
         fees and expenses incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with

         expenses and printing, mailing and solicitation costs and expenses)
         through the date of termination of this Agreement (the "PARENT FEES AND
         EXPENSES"), which shall be supported by reasonable documentation of
         such fees and expenses provided by Parent to the Company (the "PARENT
         FEES AND EXPENSES STATEMENT"); provided, further, that if (i) the
         Company shall have received a Company Acquisition Proposal from any
         Person or group which shall not have expired or been revoked prior to
         such termination of this Agreement and (ii) within twelve (12) months
         after such termination a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated or
         the Company shall have entered into an agreement with respect to a

         the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the Termination Fee
         less any Parent Fees and Expenses paid previously by the Company
         pursuant to this SECTION 8.5 within five (5) business days after the

         transfer of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the
         agreements contained in this SECTION 8.5(B) are an integral part of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
         agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement, and
         accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due
         pursuant to this SECTION 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment,
         Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company
         for the fee set forth in this SECTION 8.5(b), the Company shall pay to
         Parent its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
         amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the

                  (c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by
         either the Company or Parent pursuant to SECTION 8.2(d) and at the time
         of the Parent Stockholders Meeting there existed a Parent Acquisition
         Proposal (as defined below), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the
         Company pursuant to SECTION 8.3(b), or (iii) this Agreement is
         terminated by the Company pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a) or 8.3(a) as a
         result of the condition to the Company's obligation to consummate the
         Merger set forth in SECTION 7.2(d) not being satisfied, then Parent
         shall promptly, but in no event later than the fifth (5th) business day
         after the date of such termination, pay the Company a fee equal to the
         Termination Fee, payable by wire transfer of same day funds. In the
         event that this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent
         pursuant to SECTION 8.2(d) and at the time of the Parent Stockholders
         Meeting there did not exist a Parent Acquisition Proposal, then Parent
         shall promptly, but in no event later than the fifth (5th) business day
         after the later to occur of such termination or the receipt of the
         Company Fees and Expenses Statement referred to below, pay to the
         Company an amount equal to the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred
         by the Company in connection with execution and delivery of this
         Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
         (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and
         expenses, reasonable advisor fees and expenses and printing, mailing
         and solicitation costs and expenses) through the date of termination of
         this Agreement, which shall be supported by reasonable documentation of
         such fees and expenses provided by the Company to Parent (the "COMPANY
         FEES AND EXPENSES STATEMENT"). Parent acknowledges that the agreements
         contained in this SECTION 8.5(c) are an integral part of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
         agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement, and
         accordingly, if Parent fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
         this SECTION 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
         commences a suit which results in a judgment against Parent for the fee
         set forth in this SECTION 8.5(c), Parent shall pay to the Company its
         costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
         in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of
         the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
         payment was required to be made. As used herein, the term "PARENT
         ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer
         relating to any (i) merger, consolidation, business combination, or
         similar transaction involving Parent, (ii) sale, lease or other
         disposition, directly or indirectly, of all or a substantial portion of
         the assets or revenues of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
         in one or more transactions, (iii) issuance, sale, or other disposition
         of a majority of the voting equity securities (or options, rights or
         warrants to purchase such securities, or securities convertible into
         such securities) of Parent, (iv) liquidation, dissolution,
         recapitalization or other similar type of transaction with respect to
         Parent, (v) tender offer or exchange offer for a majority of the voting
         equity securities of Parent; or (vi) other transaction which is similar
         in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions in
         the case of (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) above, which
         transaction would result in a third party (or its stockholders)
         acquiring more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of, or
         economic interest in, Parent or the assets representing more than fifty
         percent (50%) of the net income, net revenue or assets of Parent on a
         consolidated basis, provided,


                                       67

         however, that the term "PARENT ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" shall not include
         the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (d) In the event both Parent and the Company would otherwise
         be entitled to receive the Termination Fee under this SECTION 8.5 in
         connection with the termination of this Agreement, neither party shall
         be required to make any payment under this SECTION 8.5.

                  (e) If this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in
         which Parent or the Company is entitled to receive the Termination Fee,
         (i) the obligation to pay the Termination Fee shall survive the
         termination of this Agreement and (ii) the payment of the Termination
         Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent or the
         Company, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
         contained herein, in the event of a willful breach by a Party of any
         covenant contained in this Agreement, the other Party hereto shall have
         all rights, powers and remedies against the other party that may be
         available at law or in equity. All rights, powers and remedies provided
         under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or
         in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of
         any such right, power or remedy by any Party shall not preclude the
         simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy
         by such Party.

                                   ARTICLE IX

transactions contemplated hereby (the "TRANSACTION EXPENSES").

         9.2 NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The representations
and warranties made in SECTIONS 5.1 and 5.2 hereof shall not survive beyond the
Effective Time or a termination of this Agreement, except to the extent a
willful breach of such representation or intentional or Knowing
misrepresentation formed the basis for such termination. This SECTION 9.2 shall
not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms
contemplates performance after the Effective Time or after termination of this
Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII, including the payment of any Termination
Fee.

         9.3 MODIFICATION OR AMENDMENT. Subject to the applicable provisions of
the DGCL, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties, by resolution of
their respective Board of Directors, may modify or amend this Agreement, by

respective Parties; provided, however, that after approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of either the Company or Parent is obtained, no amendment which
requires further stockholder approval shall be made without such approval of
stockholders.
