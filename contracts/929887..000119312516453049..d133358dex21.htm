NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,

agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company

place at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York,
New York, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) (a) on the third (3rd) business day

waiver of those conditions at the Closing) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement (such date, the " _Conditions Satisfaction
Date_ ", and the date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "); _provided_ ,
that if the Conditions Satisfaction Date occurs after the tenth (10th) day of
a month, the Closing may occur, at Parents election on the first business
day of the subsequent month or at such other date prior to the first business
day of the subsequent month as Parent may determine; _provided_ , _however_ ,

conditions set forth in Sections 7.1(c)(ii), 7.1(c)(iii), 7.2(a) (other than
with respect to the Company Fundamental Representations), 7.2(c), 7.2(d) and
7.2(e) shall be deemed to have been satisfied or waived as of the Conditions
Satisfaction Date; or (b) at such other date as the Company and Parent may
mutually agree in writing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other

to close in the City of New York or the Arizona Corporation Commission (the "
_ACC_ ") is required or authorized to close.

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date following
the Closing, the Company and Parent shall cause the statement of merger and

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_

 

 _Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share, without par value, of Class A Common
Stock (the " _Class A Shares_ ") and each share, without par value, of Class B
Common Stock (the " _Class B Shares_ ") of the Company (each unit of Class A
Shares or Class B Shares, a " _Share_ ," or, the Class A Shares and Class B
Shares collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger

 



-3-  Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and
Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of the Company, in each case not held on behalf of third parties (each, an "
_Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be
converted into the right to receive cash, without interest, in the amount of
$9.50 per Share (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective
Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
formerly representing any of the Shares and each non-certificated Share
represented by book entry (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") (in each case, other than
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without interest, subject to compliance with the
procedures for surrender of such Shares as set forth in Section 4.2.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder of such Excluded Share, shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted at the
Effective Time into one (1) newly and validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of
the holders of Shares (other than Excluded Shares), cash in immediately
available funds in the aggregate amount necessary for the Paying Agent to make
the payments contemplated by Section 4.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The agreement pursuant to which
Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be
in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination
of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a
maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amount
payable under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation.

 



-4- (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other
than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Shares shall pass, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an
"agents message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or
such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), and with respect to Certificates, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time, and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Book-Entry Shares or
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided
in Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent.

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) and upon delivery of a
letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificate, to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter
of transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal
to (A) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) _multiplied by_
(B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or affidavits of loss,
as the case may be.

 

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a). In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form or such other evidence, if any, as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request (it being understood that the holders of Book-
Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Shares upon receipt by
the Paying Agent of such "agents message" or such other evidence, if any, as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to
any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) equal to (A) the
number of Shares represented by such Book-Entry Shares _multiplied by_ (B) the
Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Shares.

 



-5- (iv) _Special Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall reasonably cooperate to establish procedures with the
Paying Agent and The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") designed to provide
that (A) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time)
on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on
the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to (x)
the number of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held of record by DTC or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (B)
if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date,
the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first (1st)
business day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the DTC Payment. 

(v) _Unrecorded Transfers_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be
made to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. The payments made in
accordance with this Article IV upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds
to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article
IV.

(d)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or Book-Entry
Shares and in compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.2,
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed as of a date that
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would 

 



-6-  otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity will,
to the extent permissible under applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-profit),
general or limited partnership, company (including any limited liability
company or joint stock company), joint venture, estate, trust, association,
organization, labor union, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
5.1(e)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature. 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon and in exchange for the
delivery of an executed affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms
as may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will make a payment in the amount (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(f))
equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate _multiplied by_ the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or
Company Equity Awards (as defined in Section 4.3(f)) such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section
5.1(s)) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity,
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be.

 

4.3. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time each outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ ") under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan
as Amended and Restated (the " _Stock Plan_ "), whether vested or unvested,
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Option to
receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after
the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share
Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share of such Company
Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option which has an exercise
price per Share that is greater than or equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment.

 



-7- (b) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, (A) any vesting conditions
applicable to each outstanding restricted stock unit (a " _Company RSU_ ")
under the Stock Plan, shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in full, and (B) each Company RSU
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company
RSU to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) business days after
the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares
subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ , that, with
respect to any Company RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at
the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
Stock Plan and applicable award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(c) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, (A) any vesting conditions
applicable to each outstanding performance stock unit (a " _Company PSU_ ")
under the Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate
only with respect to the number of Shares determined in accordance with the
terms and conditions set forth in the award agreement evidencing each such
Company PSU, and (B) each Company PSU shall, automatically and without
any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company PSU to receive (without interest), as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no
later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time), an amount in
cash equal to (x) the number of vested Shares subject to such Company PSU
immediately following accelerated vesting pursuant to Section 4.3(c)(A)
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes

reasonably could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or
4976 of the Code in an amount that could be material. Each Company Plan that

the Code and the regulations thereunder.

obligation of any sort) in the last six (6) years to (A) a plan that is

is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA). No Company Plan provides retiree health
or life insurance benefits except as may be required by Section 4980B of the
Code and Section 601 of ERISA or any other applicable Law.

(vi) Except as required by Section 4.3 of this Agreement, neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, shareholder or other approval of

terms of this Agreement, would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (y) the Company Board or any committee thereof
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after
consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel that
such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.

of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other Proceeding by any Person
or entity, including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity or

or otherwise prohibit, consummation of the Merger or the Transactions and the

that would make consummation of the Merger or the Transactions in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the
Transactions, any and all steps (including, without limitation, the appeal
thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by
Section 6.5(d)(ii)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend,
prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to
permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement.

Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company further agrees that it shall not,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and, in the case of the Company,
its Affiliates, not to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay, impair or impede the receipt of any regulatory approvals,
Educational Consents or Educational Approvals required in connection with the
Merger, the Transactions or the Closing.

 

6.6. _Takeover Statutes_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (a) use
reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to ensure that no
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Support
Agreements, the Merger or any of the Transactions and refrain from taking any
actions that would cause the applicability of such Laws to this Agreement,
the Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the Transactions and (b) if the
restrictions of any Takeover Statute become applicable to this Agreement, the
Support Agreements, the Merger or any of the

 



-61-  Transactions, use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to
ensure that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Support
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreements (as applicable) and
otherwise lawfully eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute
with respect to this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Merger or any of
the Transactions.

Representatives in connection with any inspection or evaluation requested or
conducted pursuant to this Section 6.7, _provided_ that, in each case, the
Company shall not be required to permit any inspection, or disclose any
document or information, that would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, (A) violate the terms of any confidentiality provisions in any
agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement
(or entered into after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section
6.1) after consultation with its outside counsel, (B) result in a violation of
applicable Law, including any fiduciary duty, (C) after consultation with its
outside counsel, waive the protection of any attorney-client privilege or (D)
result in the disclosure of any sensitive or personal information that would
expose the Company to the risk of Liability; _provided_ _further_ that the
parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to find a way to allow as much
access to or disclosure of such information as may be possible or provide a
reasonable alternative to such access or disclosure that would not (in the
good faith belief of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel)
be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such agreement or Law
or cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or
waive or reveal such sensitive or personal information, including through the
use of customary "clean team" or other similar procedures. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.7 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of its representatives will be permitted to collect or
analyze any environmental samples or perform any invasive environmental
procedure with respect to any property of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All information made available or disclosed pursuant to this
Section 6.7 shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated July 27, 2015, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 

6.8. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by Parent and the
Surviving Corporation of the Class A Shares from NASDAQ and the

practicable after the Effective Time.

 



-62- 6.9. _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the Company
with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company, and each of Parent and the Company shall
have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such press release
prior to the issuance of such press release. Neither the Company nor Parent
(nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates) shall issue any other
press release or make any other public announcement with respect to this
Agreement or the Merger or the Transactions without prior consultation with
the other parties, except as may be required by applicable Law or by any
listing agreement with a national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall
consult in good faith with the other party before making any such public
announcements to the extent reasonably practicable; _provided_ that the
Company will not consult with Parent in connection with any such press release
or public announcement if the Company Board has effected a Change of
Recommendation (including in connection with any press release or public
announcement relating to such Change of Recommendation); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict communications between
Parent and the investors or potential investors of Parent or its Affiliates
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, not to any Affiliate of Parent that is a
portfolio company) in the ordinary course of business. 

6.10. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending one year after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
is employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ "), (i) base salary or base wage that is no less
favorable than the base salary or base wage provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) annual incentive opportunities (excluding (1) equity
or equity-based compensation and retention and change in control awards and
(2) any Company Plan that is not in compliance with applicable Law) that are
no less than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees
that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
December 31 of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee,
retirement, health and welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent agrees that, during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2016,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Continuing
Employee, severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Parents obligations under
this Section 6.10(a) are subject to such Continuing Employee remaining
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under
any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect
to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each
Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time

employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting,
benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable Parent
benefit plan (including, without limitation, with respect to severance,
vacation and other PTO entitlements), as if such service had been performed
with Parent, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans,
for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the
extent it would result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(c) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the time when bonuses are paid with
respect to the Companys 2016 fiscal year, Parent agrees that the Company
will be permitted to honor the terms of the Companys annual cash incentive
plans, as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to the determination and
payment of annual cash bonuses thereunder.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, including Section 6.1 and this
Section 6.10, is intended to (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular
Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans or, after
the Effective Time, any Company Plan in accordance their terms, (iii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates, after the
Effective Time, from terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee, or
(iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

-64- 6.12. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
hereby agrees, to do the following:

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless (including advancement
of expenses as incurred) the present and former officers, directors and
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who served at the Companys or
its Subsidiarys request as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary
of any pension or other employee benefit plan (each, an " _Indemnified Person_
"), in each case, as provided in the articles of incorporation or by-laws of
the Company in effect on the date hereof, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, against any Liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred in connection with any Proceeding relating to, arising from or in
connection with such Indemnified Persons services as a director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Indemnified
Person at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i)
the Merger and the Transactions and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or
any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Person.

 

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the
provisions in the Companys articles of incorporation and by-laws that are in
effect as of the date hereof (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is
available for such amount (the maximum amount of the aggregate annual premium
over such six (6) year term, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In lieu of the
foregoing, at or prior to the Effective Time, the Company may (at its
election), or at Parents request shall, obtain prepaid policies with respect
to (i) the DandO Insurance and (ii) the Managing Liability Insurance (as
defined in the Support Agreement entered into with the Apollo Class B Voting
Stock Trust No. 1), which policies provide such directors and officers, the
Apollo Class B Voting Stock Trust No. 1 and its trustees, as applicable, with
coverage for an aggregate period of at least six (6) years with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective
Time, including in connection with the adoption and approval of this
Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions;

 



-65-   _provided_ , that the Company shall not spend in excess of the Maximum
Premium to obtain such prepaid policies. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.12.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 6.12 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the articles of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Arizona Law or any other applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

Subsidiaries to, provide and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives, including its or their legal and

financing or debt facilities to be obtained, arranged or committed to on or

credit facilities of the type to be included in the Debt Financing, or as may
be reasonably requested by Parent, to consummate the syndication of credit
facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing;

 



-66- (iv) using reasonable best efforts to provide financial information regarding

their respective Representatives shall be required to (A) pay any commitment

Financing prior to the Closing that is not simultaneously reimbursed by Parent
or (B) take any action that will conflict with or violate the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries organizational documents; (ii) nothing herein
shall require such cooperation to the extent it would, in the good faith
determination of the Company, interfere unreasonably with the business or

to take any action in connection with the Debt Financing that is not
contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement) other

neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective

Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing), in each case, except to
the extent suffered or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence
or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, in each
case, their respective Representatives.

(b) The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such

disparage or otherwise adversely affect the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(iv) Neither the Company nor UOPX shall have received any written response
that any post-Closing Educational Consents will not be provided in a timely
manner following the Closing or that such post-Closing Educational Consents
will include any Consent Condition; provided, however the receipt of any such
response shall not be a condition to Closing unless such response relates to
a Governmental Entity that is identified in Section 7.1(c)(iv) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(v) With respect to the consents identified on Section 7.1(c)(v) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company or UOPX (a) shall have made or

the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or Affiliates);
_provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, that (i) Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent and

Termination and Abandonment_ ), the last sentence of Section 6.13(a) (
_Financing Cooperation_ ), the last sentence of Section 6.l4 ( _Treatment of
Company Indebtedness_ ) and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with its terms
and conditions (and for the avoidance of doubt, no such termination shall
relieve the Company of its obligation to pay the Termination Fee if, as and
when required pursuant to Section 8.5(b) and (ii) no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any Liability to the other party hereto resulting
from any knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud. As used in
this Agreement, the phrase "knowing and intentional" means, with respect to
any act or omission, the taking of a deliberate act, or omission, which act
constitutes in and of itself a breach, even if breaching was not the conscious
object of the act or omission.

 

(b) In the event either party terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(c) ( _No Shareholder Approval_ ), within three (3) business days after
such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent any and
all documented fees and expenses of third parties (including fees and expenses
of financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts,
consultants and other Representatives) actually incurred, paid or payable by
or on behalf of Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution, performance, termination

_Parent Expenses_ "); _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company have any
obligation to pay Parent Expenses in excess of $12,500,000; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to
this Section 8.5(b) shall not relieve the Company of any obligation to pay the
Termination Fee, except to the extent indicated in the proviso to Section
8.5(c). 

(c) In the event that (i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company or any of its shareholders or any Person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the

terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a) ( _Change of Recommendation_

8.3(a) (Superior Proposal), then the Company shall pay a termination fee of
2.75% of the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (the "
_Termination Fee_ "); _provided_ , that any Parent Expenses paid by the
Company to Parent pursuant to Section 8.5(b) shall be credited against, and

Section 8.5(c).

 



-77- (d) The Company shall pay any Termination Fee as required pursuant to Section

later than:

 

(i) within five (5) business days after the earlier to occur of entry into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and consummation of an Acquisition Proposal
with respect to the events described in clause (i) of Section 8.5(c) if, and
only if, within twelve (12) months of such termination, (1) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (2) there shall have been
consummated an Acquisition Proposal (substituting in both instances "50%" for
"15%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal");

(ii) two (2) days after the date of such termination with respect to the
events described in clause (ii) of Section 8.5(c); and

(iii) substantially concurrently with the termination with respect to the
events described in clause (iii) of Section 8.5(c).

(e) In the event Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(c),
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company a reverse termination fee
of $25,000,000 (the " _Reverse Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available cash funds to an account specified by the Company, and
such payment shall be made substantially concurrently with any such
termination. Except with respect to liability or damage resulting from a
willful and material breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section
8.4(c) and the Reverse Termination Fee is paid by Buyer to the Company
pursuant to this Section 8.5(e), the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy against Parent or Merger Sub
for any liability or damage relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the
Merger or the Transactions.

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections 8.5(b),
8.5(c) and 8.5(d) are an integral part of the Merger and the Transactions,
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts
due pursuant to Sections 8.5(b), 8.5(c) and 8.5(d) and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fees set forth in Sections 8.5(b), 8.5(c) and
8.5(d) or any portion of such fee, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger
Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made through the date of payment. In no event shall the Company
be required to reimburse the Parent Expenses or pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion each, and in no event shall the aggregate payments
pursuant to Sections 8.5(b), 8.5(c) and 8.5(d) exceed the amount of the
Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
reimbursement of the Parent Expenses or payment of the Termination Fee shall
each constitute liquidated damages.

 



-78- ARTICLE IX

 

 _Miscellaneous and General_

 

9.1. _Survival_. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub contained in Article IV and Sections 6.10 ( _Employee Benefits_ ),
6.11 ( _Expenses_ ), 6.12 ( _Director and Officer Liability_ ) and 6.18 (
_University of Phoenix and Western International University Governance_ )
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions in
accordance with their respective terms. Except as set forth in this Section
9.1 and Section 8.5(a), all other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the Merger
and the Transactions or the termination of this Agreement.

9.2. _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of the applicable
Laws and Section 9.8, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may modify, supplement or amend this Agreement, solely by a written
agreement authorized by the board of directors and executed and delivered by
duly authorized officers of the respective parties; _provided_ , that, after
the Requisite Company Vote has been obtained, there shall be no amendment or
waiver that would require the further approval of the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law without such approval having first been
obtained.

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties
obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and may be waived by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws _provided_ , _however_ , that any such waiver shall only be
effective if made in writing. The failure of any party to assert any of its
rights hereunder or under applicable Law shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no single or
partial exercise by any party of any of its rights hereunder precludes any
other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights hereunder or
under applicable Law.

 

9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an
original instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute the
same agreement.

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

(a) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA ARE MANDATORILY
APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER AND THE TRANSACTIONS, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED
TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED
BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO
THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES
WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. The parties hereby irrevocably
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New
York or, if such Supreme Court shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, solely in
respect of the interpretation

 



-79-  and enforcement of the provisions of (and any claim or cause of action
arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of the documents referred to
in this Agreement, and in respect of the Merger and the Transactions, and
hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such Proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to
such Proceeding or transactions shall be heard and determined in such courts.
The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
Person of such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject
matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such Proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or
in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
THE MERGER OR THE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ANY PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE DEBT
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCES).
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached (and, more specifically, that
immediate and irreparable harm would likewise occur if the Merger or any of
the Transactions were not consummated and the Companys shareholders did not
receive the aggregate consideration payable to them in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement). It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Supreme Court of the State of New York or,
if said Supreme Court shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.
Each party further agrees that no other party or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 9.5(c), and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

 



-80- (d) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH
OF THE PARTIES AGREES THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ANY DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTER, ALL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ANY OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES
IN ANY WAY RELATING TO ANY DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE
FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto agrees that
it will not bring or support any Proceeding or cause of Proceeding, whether
in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Debt Financing sources and their respective Representatives or Affiliates in
any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 

9.6. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given
hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered
personally or sent by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested
and postage prepaid), by facsimile, email or overnight courier (with proof of

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Support
Agreements, the Parent Affiliate Side Letter, the Equity Commitment Letters
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof.

 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in Section 6.12 (
_Director and Officer Liability_ ), (ii) for the right of holders of Shares
as of the Effective Time, after the Effective Time, to receive the aggregate
consideration payable pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement and (iii) with
respect to the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent

Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon

 



-82-  any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including, without limitation, the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein;  _provided_ that the Debt Financing sources
shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of Sections 8.5 ( _Effect of
Termination and Abandonment_ ), 9.5 ( _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury
Trial; Specific Performance_ ), 9.14 ( _Assignment_ ), 9.17 ( _Non-Recourse
to Debt Financing Sources_ ) and this Section 9.8 (it being understood that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9.2, if a Debt Financing
is obtained prior to the Closing Date, the foregoing provisions may not be
amended in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing sources in any material
respect without their prior written consent). The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any
inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by
the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3 without notice or Liability
to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due.

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in Annex A is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision in any
jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of
such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



-83- 9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive. Any reference to "ordinary
course of business" will be interpreted to mean "ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice."

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. 

(c) Each party to this Agreement has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter in a section of such disclosure letter that
corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact
that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure letter to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required
to be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Parent may designate, by
written notice to (but without the consent of) the Company, another wholly-
owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of
Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be
deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations
and warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other Subsidiary as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any
such designation shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the
Merger or the Transactions or otherwise materially impede the rights of the
shareholders of the Company under this Agreement, (b) Parent may assign any or
all of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates;
_provided_ , that any such assignment shall not relieve Parent of its
liabilities and obligations hereunder and (c) Parent may assign any or all of
its rights and obligations to any Debt Financing source as collateral in
connection with a Debt Financing and any such Debt Financing source
may exercise all of the rights and remedies of Parent hereunder in connection
with the enforcement of any security or exercise of any remedies to the extent
permitted under any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing,
in each case, without prior written consent of the Company. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

9.15. _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in or to be
vested in the

 



-84-  Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things
as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets
in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

9.16. _No Personal Liability_. Without limiting the rights of the Company or
its Affiliates under, and to the extent provided in, this Agreement, the
Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery against, and
no personal liability shall attach to, in each case with respect to money
damages of the Company and its Affiliates, any of Parent, its Affiliates or
their respective members, shareholders, officers, directors, managers,
employees, agents, advisors, partners, Representatives, successors and assigns
through Parent or otherwise (the " _Parent Parties_ "), whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited
liability veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of either Parent or any
other Parent Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law,
or otherwise. Without limiting the rights of Parent and Merger Sub or their
Affiliates under, and to the extent provided in, this Agreement or the Support
Agreements, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that they have no
right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each
case with respect to money damages of Parent and Merger Sub and their
Affiliates, any of the Company or its Affiliates or their respective
shareholders, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, advisors,
partners, Representatives, successors and assigns (the " _Company Parties_ "),
through the Company or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability veil, by or through a
claim by or on behalf of either the Company or any other Company Party, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise.

9.17. _Non-Recourse to Debt Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, each party hereto agrees, on behalf of itself and its
respective Affiliates, that none of the Debt Financing sources shall have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
(including any Debt Financing).

Exhibit A-1 SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED

 

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF

 

APOLLO EDUCATION GROUP, INC.

 

(An Arizona corporation)

 

ARTICLE I

The name of the Corporation is Apollo Education Group, Inc. (the "
_Corporation_ ").

ARTICLE II

 

The name and street address of the Corporations statutory agent in the State
of Arizona is Corporation Service Company, 2338 W. Royal Palm Road, Suite J,
Phoenix, Arizona 85021. The street address of the known place of business of
the Corporation is 4025 South Riverpoint Parkway, MS CF-KX01, Phoenix, Arizona
85040.

 

ARTICLE III

The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for
which corporations may be organized under Chapter 1 of Title 10, Arizona
Revised Statutes as it now exists or may hereafter be amended and/or
supplemented from time to time (the " _ARS_ "). The character of the business
that the Corporation conducts in the State of Arizona includes that of holding
stock or other ownership interests of corporations or other entities.

 

ARTICLE IV

The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation is authorized to
issue is one hundred (100) shares of capital stock (the " _Common Stock_ ").
Each holder of record of Common Stock shall be entitled to vote at all
meetings of the shareholders and shall have one vote for each share held by
such holder of record, provided, that with respect to elections of directors,
each holder of record of Common Stock shall be entitled to cumulate their
votes by multiplying the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the
number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote and casting the product
for a single candidate or distributing the product among two or more
candidates.

 

ARTICLE V

From time to time, any of the provisions of these Second Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and other
provisions authorized by the ARS or other statutes or laws of the State of
Arizona at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at
the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon
the shareholders of the Corporation by these Second Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation.

ARTICLE VI

 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the rights, powers, privileges and
discretionary authority granted or conferred by the ARS or other statutes or
laws of the State of Arizona, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "
_Board_ ") is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws
of the Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), without any action on the part of the
shareholders (except to the extent provided in ARS § 10-1020(A)(2)), but the
shareholders may make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws whether adopted by
the shareholders or otherwise.

 



Exhibit A-2 ARTICLE VII

 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a director or former
director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation
or its shareholders for monetary damages for any action taken or any failure
to take any action as a director. This provision shall not eliminate or limit
the liability of a director for any of the following: (i) the amount of
a financial benefit received by a director to which the director is not
entitled, (ii) an intentional infliction of harm on the Corporation or its
shareholders, (iii) a violation of ARS Section 10-833 or (iv) an
intentional violation of criminal law. If the ARS is hereafter amended to
authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal
liability of directors, then the liability of a director shall be eliminated
or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the ARS, as so amended.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation may indemnify a
director or former director for any liability (as defined in ARS Section
10-850) to any person for any action taken, or any failure to take any action,
except liability for any of the following: (i) the amount of a financial
benefit received by a director to which the director is not entitled, (ii) an
intentional infliction of harm on the Corporation or its shareholders, (iii) a
violation of ARS Section 10-833 or (iv) an intentional violation of criminal
law.

 

The Corporation may advance expenses with respect to any liability for which
it may so indemnify, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the
Corporation. The authority of the Corporation to so indemnify and advance
expenses shall be in addition to the provisions of ARS Sections 10-850 to
10-858 and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall apply whether or
not the Corporation would have power to indemnify or advance expenses to the
individual against the same liability under the provisions of ARS Sections
10-850 to 10-858 in the absence of the above authority. The authority of the
Corporation to so indemnify and advance expenses shall be in addition to the
provisions of any contract or Corporation bylaw dealing with indemnification
or advancement of expenses, provided, however, that any contract or bylaw
purporting to make indemnification or advancement of expenses mandatory shall
not apply to the indemnification authority pursuant to this ARTICLE VII, which
shall remain discretionary. Any determination to indemnify or advance expenses
pursuant to this ARTICLE VII shall be made by the Board by a majority vote.
In addition, any determination to indemnify or advance expenses pursuant to
this ARTICLE VII may be made by any other authorizing method permitted by law.

 

ARTICLE VIII

Meetings of shareholders may be held within or without the State of Arizona,
as the Bylaws may provide. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
annual or special meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all the holders of
outstanding Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, and shall be delivered to
the Corporation.

 

The books of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained
in the ARS) within or without the State of Arizona at such place or places as
may be designated from time to time by the Board or in the Bylaws.

ARTICLE IX

 

Any contract, transaction or act of the Corporation or of the directors of the
Corporation that is ratified at any annual meeting of the shareholders of the
Corporation, or at any special meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation
called for such purpose, will, insofar as permitted by applicable law (and
subject, if applicable, to ARS § 10-863), be as valid and as binding
as though ratified by every shareholder of the Corporation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any failure of the shareholders to approve or

 



Exhibit A-3  ratify any such contract, transaction or act, when and if submitted, will
not be deemed in any way to invalidate the same or deprive the Corporation,
its directors, officers or employees, of its or their right to proceed with
such contract, transaction or act.

Subject to any express agreement that may from time to time be in effect, (x)
any director or officer of the Corporation who is also an officer, director,
partner, employee, managing director or other affiliate of either Apollo
Management VIII, L.P., on behalf of its investment funds (" _Apollo_ "), or
any of its respective affiliates (collectively, the " _Managers_ ") and (y)
the Managers and their affiliates, may, and shall have no duty not to, in each
case on behalf of the Managers or their affiliates (the persons and entities
in clauses (x) and (y), each a " _Covered Manager Person_ "), to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, (i) carry on and conduct, whether
directly, or as a partner in any partnership, or as a member or manager in
any limited liability company or as a joint venturer in any joint venture, or
as an officer, director or shareholder of any corporation, or as a participant
in any syndicate, pool, trust or association, any business of any kind,
nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in
the same or similar lines of business as the Corporation, (ii) do business
with any client, customer, vendor or lessor of any of the Corporation or its
affiliates and (iii) make investments in any kind of property in which the
Corporation may make investments. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy of
the Corporation to participate in any business of the Managers or their
affiliates, and waives any claim against a Covered Manager Person and shall
indemnify a Covered Manager Person against any claim that such Covered Manager
Person is liable to the Corporation or its shareholders for breach of any
fiduciary duty solely by reason of such persons or entitys participation in
any such business.

 

In the event that a Covered Manager Person acquires knowledge of a potential
transaction or matter which may constitute a corporate opportunity for both
(x) the Covered Manager Person, in his or her Apollo-related capacity, as the
case may be, or Apollo, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as
the case may be, or its affiliates and (y) the Corporation, the Covered
Manager Person shall not have any duty to offer or communicate information
regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Corporation hereby renounces any interest
or expectancy of the Corporation in such corporate opportunity and waives any
claim against each Covered Manager Person and shall indemnify a Covered
Manager Person against any claim, that such Covered Manager Person is liable
to the Corporation or its shareholders for breach of any fiduciary duty
solely by reason of the fact that such Covered Manager Person (i) pursues or
acquires any corporate opportunity for its own account or the account of any
affiliate, (ii) directs, recommends, sells, assigns or otherwise transfers
such corporate opportunity to another person or (iii) does not communicate
information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Corporation,
_provided_ , _however_ , in each case, that any corporate opportunity which
is expressly offered to a Covered Manager Person in writing, solely in his or
her capacity as an officer or director of the Corporation, shall belong to the
Corporation.

 

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest
in any shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this ARTICLE IX.

This ARTICLE IX may not be amended, modified or repealed without the prior
written consent of each of the Managers.

In the event of a conflict between this ARTICLE IX and any other Article or
provision of these Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, this
ARTICLE IX shall prevail under all circumstances.

 



Exhibit A-4 ARTICLE X

 

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a
claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation to the Corporation or the
Corporations shareholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the
Corporation or any director, officer, employee, agent or shareholder of the
Corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the ARS or the Bylaws or
these Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (in each case, as
they may be amended from time to time) or (d) any action asserting a claim
against the Corporation or any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state court
located within the State of Arizona (or, if no state court located within the
State of Arizona has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District
of Arizona), in all cases subject to the court having personal jurisdiction
over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. If any action the
subject matter of which is within the scope of the preceding sentence is filed
in a court other than a court located within the State of Arizona (a "
_Foreign Action_ ") in the name of any shareholder, such shareholder shall be
deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts located within the State of Arizona in connection with
any action brought in any such court to enforce the preceding sentence and
(b) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such action by
service upon such shareholders counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for
such shareholder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be (i) deemed to
have notice of and consented to the provisions of this ARTICLE X and (ii)
deemed to have waived any argument relating to the inconvenience of the
forums referenced above in connection with any action or proceeding described
in this ARTICLE X.

 

ARTICLE XI

To the fullest extent permitted by ARS §10-2743(B)(2), the Corporation elects
not to be governed by Article 3 of Chapter 23 of Title 10 (ARS §§ 10-2741
through 10-2743) of the ARS.

Exhibit B-1 SECOND AMENDED and RESTATED BYLAWS

 

OF

APOLLO EDUCATION GROUP, INC.

(Adopted [ ● ], 2016)

 

ARTICLE I

_Offices_

 

Section 1\. _Known Place of Business; Statutory Agent_. The name and address
of the statutory agent of Apollo Education Group, Inc. (the " _Corporation_
") in the State of Arizona shall be as set forth in the Second Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation (as the same may be
amended and/or restated from time to time, the " _Articles of Incorporation_
"). The known place of business of the Corporation in the State of Arizona
shall be as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation. The Corporations
known place of business and its statutory agent in the State of Arizona may
be changed from time to time by or under the authority of the board of
directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ ") in the manner
provided in the Arizona Revised Statutes (the " _ARS_ ").

 

Section 2\. _Other Offices_. The Corporation may have a principal or other
office or offices at such other place or places, either within or without the
State of Arizona, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or
as shall be necessary or appropriate for the conduct of the business of the
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE II

_Shareholders _

Section 1\. _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at
the principal office of the Corporation or at such other place, if any,
within or without the State of Arizona, or by means of remote communication,
as may be designated by the Board of Directors and stated in the notice of the
meeting.

 

Section 2\. _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of shareholders for the
election of directors and the transaction of such other business as may
properly come before the meeting shall be held on such day and at such hour,
as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors and designated in the notice of
the meeting. At each annual meeting, the shareholders entitled to vote
shall elect a Board of Directors and may transact such other corporate
business as may properly be brought before the meeting.

Section 3.  _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the shareholders (or of
any class thereof) for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by
the Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by order of the Board of
Directors and shall be called by the President or the Secretary upon the
written request therefor delivered to the President or Secretary signed by
shareholders holding of record more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting. Such written request shall
state the purpose or purposes for which such meeting is to be called and the
call therefor shall be issued within sixty (60) days after the receipt of said
request. Business transacted at all special meetings shall be confined to the
objects specifically stated in the call therefor.

 



Exhibit B-2 Section 4\. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise expressly required by
law, written notice of each meeting of shareholders, whether annual or
special, shall be given at least ten (10) and not more than sixty (60) days
before the date on which the meeting is to be held to each shareholder of
record entitled to vote thereat by delivering a notice thereof to such
shareholder personally or by mailing such notice in a postage prepaid envelope
directed to such shareholder at such shareholders address as it appears on
the share ledger of the Corporation, unless such shareholder shall have filed
with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices intended
for such shareholder be directed to another address, in which case such notice
shall be directed to such shareholder at the address designated in such
request. Notices of each meeting of shareholders, whether annual or special,
shall set forth the date, time, place, if any, the means of remote
communications, if any, by which shareholders or proxy holders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and the record date for
determining the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting (if such date is
different from the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of the
meeting). Notices of each special meeting of shareholders shall also set
forth the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. "Notice"
includes notice given by facsimile or other form of wire or wireless
communication if permitted by applicable law and if given in compliance
therewith. If electronically transmitted by means of facsimile or other form
of wire or wireless communication, including electronic mail, then notice is
deemed given when transmitted and directed to a facsimile number or
electronic mail address, as the case may be, at which the shareholder has
consented to receive notice. If mailed, notice shall be deemed to be given
when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
shareholder in the manner set forth herein. An affidavit of the Secretary or
of the transfer agent or other agent of the Corporation that the notice has
been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be _prima facie_ evidence of the
facts stated therein.

 

Section 5\. _List of Shareholders_. The Secretary or any Assistant Secretary
of the Corporation shall produce, beginning two (2) business days after
notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing
through the meeting, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote
thereat (provided, however, if the record date for determining
the shareholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10) days before the date
of the meeting, the list shall reflect the shareholders entitled to vote as of
the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and
showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares registered
in the name of such shareholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of
any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period beginning
two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list
was prepared and continuing through the meeting, either at the principal place
of business of the Corporation during ordinary business hours, the office of
the Corporations transfer agent if specified in the meeting notice or at
another place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting
will be held. If the meeting is to be held at a place, such list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof and may be examined by any shareholder who is present. If the meeting
is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall
also be open to the examination of any shareholder during the whole time of
the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network (provided that the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting). Except as otherwise provided by law, the original or duplicate
share ledger shall be the only evidence as to the shareholders entitled to
examine such list or to vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.

 

Section 6\. _Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the Articles of Incorporation or these Second Amended and Restated Bylaws
of the Corporation (" _Bylaws_ "), the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to
vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business
at all meetings of the shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly called
or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until
adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave
less than a quorum. If less than a quorum shall be present or represented at
the time for which the meeting shall have been called, the shareholders so
present in person or by proxy at 

 



Exhibit B-3  such meeting may, by a majority in voting power thereof, adjourn the meeting
from time to time without any notice or call other than by an announcement at
the meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum
shall attend. Any meeting or adjournment thereof at which a quorum is present
may also be adjourned in like manner without notice or call or upon such
notice or call as may be determined by vote of the holders of a majority in
voting power voting thereon. If, however, the adjournment is for more than
one-hundred twenty (120) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If after
the adjournment a new record date for determination of shareholders entitled
to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix
as the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of shareholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give
notice of the adjourned meeting to each shareholder of record as of the record
date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. At any adjourned meeting
at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might
have been transacted if the meeting had been held as originally called.

 

Section 7\. _Voting_. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of
Incorporation, at every meeting of shareholders, each holder of record of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation entitled to vote at such
meeting shall be entitled to one (1) vote in person or by proxy for each such
share having voting power upon the matter in question held by
such shareholder, provided, that with respect to elections of directors, each
holder of record of the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation
entitled to vote at such meeting shall be entitled to cumulate their votes by
multiplying the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of
directors for whom they are entitled to vote and casting the product for a
single candidate or distributing the product among two or more candidates.
Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another
person or persons to act for such shareholder by proxy, but no proxy shall be
voted after twelve (12) months from its date (unless a longer duration is
permitted by the ARS and the shareholder designates a longer duration). A duly
executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and
if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A proxy may remain irrevocable regardless of
whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the share
itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. Shares of the Corporation
belonging to the Corporation directly or indirectly shall not be voted
directly or indirectly; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Corporation to vote any shares of the Corporation held
by it in a fiduciary capacity (and to count such shares for purposes of
determining a quorum). Except as otherwise required by the laws of the State
of Arizona or the Articles of Incorporation, and except for the election of
directors, at all meetings of the shareholders, a quorum being present, all
matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
in voting power of the shares entitled to vote thereon which are present in
person or by proxy. On any vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the
shareholder voting, or in such shareholders name by such shareholders proxy,
if there be such a proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted by such
shareholder and the number of votes to which each share is entitled. 

Section 8\. _Organization of Meeting_. The Chairman of the Board, if any,
shall preside at all meetings of shareholders, or in his or her absence, the
Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, shall preside, or in his or her absence,
the President of the Corporation shall preside. If neither the Chairman of the
Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the President is present at the
meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares present at the meeting and
entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, shall select a person to preside at
the meeting. Subject to the requirements of any applicable law or the rules
and regulations of any national securities exchange, national securities
association or interdealer quotation system upon which the Corporations
securities may be listed, the person presiding at a meeting of shareholders
shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
including, without limitation, the regulation of the manner of voting and the
conduct of any discussion, as he or she believes

 



Exhibit B-4  to be in order. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of
all meetings of shareholders, or in his or her absence, any Assistant

Section 9\. _Action Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at
any annual or special meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all
the holders of outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon and shall be
delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law. In the event
that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the
filing of a certificate with any governmental body, if such action had been
voted on by shareholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed shall
state, in lieu of any statement required by law concerning any vote of
shareholders, that consent had been given in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10-704 of the ARS. Without limiting the manner by which consent may
be given, written consent may be given by means of electronic transmission to
the fullest extent permissible under the ARS.

the written consent of shareholders in lieu of a meeting.

ARTICLE III

_Board of Directors_

 

Section 1\. _General Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except
as may be otherwise provided by the ARS or the Articles of Incorporation.

Section 2\. _Number of Directors; Term of Office_. The Board of Directors
shall consist of one (1) member but may be increased or decreased as
hereinafter provided. Each director shall hold office until the annual meeting
of the shareholders next following his or her election and until his or her
successor shall have been elected and shall qualify, or until his or her
death, resignation or removal from office or a decrease in the number of
directors. At any time or from time to time at a special meeting called for
that purpose, the Board of Directors, by the vote of a majority of the entire
Board, may increase the number of directors of the Corporation, or may
decrease the number of directors of the Corporation; provided, however, that
in no event shall the number of directors of the Corporation be less than one
(1). Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of shareholders.
Directors need not be shareholders or residents of the State of Arizona.

 

Section 3\. _Quorum; Manner of Acting; Telephonic Participation_. Unless
otherwise provided by law, the presence of a majority of the entire Board of
Directors shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. In the absence of a quorum, the directors present shall adjourn the
meeting from time to time until a quorum shall be present. Notice of
any adjourned meeting need not be given. At all meetings of the directors, a
quorum being present, all matters shall be decided by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the directors present, except as otherwise required by the laws
of the State of Arizona or the Articles of Incorporation. All or any one or
more directors may participate in

 



Exhibit B-5  a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof by means of
conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other and participation in
a meeting pursuant to such communications equipment shall constitute presence
in person at such meeting. The minutes of any meeting of the Board of
Directors or of any committee thereof held by telephone shall be prepared in
the same manner as a meeting of the Board of Directors or of such committee
held in person.

Section 4\. _Place of Meetings_. The Board of Directors may hold its meetings
at such place or places, within or without the State of Arizona, as the Board
of Directors may from time to time determine.

 

Section 5\. _Annual Meeting_. As promptly as practicable after each annual
meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors, the Board of
Directors shall meet for the purpose of the appointment of officers and the
transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting.
Notice of such meeting need not be given if held immediately after the
annual meeting of shareholders. Such meeting may be held at any other time or
place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for
special meetings of the Board of Directors or in a waiver of notice thereof
signed by all the directors. 

Section 6\. _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at such time and place, within or without the State of Arizona, as
shall from time to time be determined by the Board of Directors. After there
has been such determination, and notice thereof has been given to each member
of the Board of Directors, regular meetings may be held without further
notice being given.

Section 7\. _Special Meetings and Notice Thereof_. Special meetings of the
Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman of the
Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, the President or by a
majority of the directors. Notice of the time, date and place of each such
meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him or her at his or
her residence or usual place of business, at least four (4) days before the
date on which the meeting is to be held, or shall be given to him or her by
telegraph, teletype, facsimile or other form of wire or wireless
communication, or be delivered personally or by telephone, not later than the
day before the day on which such meeting is to be held. Such notice shall
state the time and place of the meeting, but need not state the purposes
thereof. In lieu of the notice to be given as set forth above, a waiver
thereof in writing, signed by the director or directors entitled to said
notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent thereto for purposes of this Section 7\. If mailed, such notice
shall be deemed to be delivered at the earliest of (i) when received, (ii)
five (5) days after its deposit in the United States mail as evidenced by the
postmark, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed or (iii) on the date
shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, and if the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the
addressee. If sent by any other means (including facsimile, courier,
electronic mail or express mail, etc.), such notice shall be deemed to be
delivered when actually delivered to the home or business address, electronic
address or facsimile number of the director. Attendance of a person at a
meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the
person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, and objects at
the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened. The person or persons authorized
to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place, either
within or without the State of Arizona, as the place for holding any special
meeting of the Board of Directors called by them. 

Section 8\. _Removal_. Except as otherwise provided by the Articles of
Incorporation or applicable law, the entire Board of Directors or any
individual director may be removed from office with or without cause by the
holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to

 



Exhibit B-6  vote at an election of directors. In case the Board of Directors or any one
or more directors be so removed, one or more individuals may be appointed at
the same meeting at which such director or directors have been so removed to
fill the vacancy or vacancies created thereby, to serve for the remainder of
the terms, respectively, of the director or directors so removed.

 

Section 9\. _Resignation_. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Board of Directors, the Chairman
of the Board, if any, or the Corporation. The resignation of any director
shall take effect upon receipt of notice thereof or at such later time as
shall be specified in such notice; and, unless otherwise specified
therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective.

Section 10\. _Vacancies on Board of Directors_. If any vacancy occurs in the
Board of Directors caused by the death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office of any director or otherwise, or any
new directorship is created by any increase in the authorized number
of directors, a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a
quorum, may fill the vacancy or newly created directorship, as the case may
be, or such vacancy or newly created directorship may be filled at an annual
meeting or at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose.
Each director so elected shall hold office until the next meeting of
shareholders at which directors are elected and until his or her successor
shall be elected and shall be qualified or until his or her death,
resignation or removal from office.

Section 11 _Waiver of Notice and Consent_. The transactions of any meeting of
the Board of Directors, however called and noticed or wherever held, shall be
as valid as though such meeting had been duly held after a regular call and
notice, if a quorum be present and if, before or after the meeting, each of
the directors not present signs or electronically transmits a written waiver
of notice of such meeting whether before or after the date stated therein.
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or
special meeting of directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice. All such waivers shall be filed
with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.

 

Section 12\. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution of the
Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to
consist of one or more directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent
provided in the resolution or in these Bylaws, shall have and may exercise
such powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business
and affairs of the Corporation, as the Board of Directors may by resolution
determine and specify in the respective resolutions appointing them, subject
to such restrictions as may be contained in the Articles of Incorporation or
the laws of the State of Arizona. Such committee or committees shall have
such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolutions
adopted by the Board of Directors. The committees shall keep regular minutes
of their proceedings and report the same to the Board of Directors when
required. A majority of all the members of any such committee may, subject to
ARS § 10-825(C), fix its rules of procedure, determine its action and fix the
time and place, whether within or without the State of Arizona, of its
meetings and specify what notice thereof, if any, shall be given, unless the
Board of Directors shall otherwise by resolution provide. The Board of
Directors shall have the power to change the membership of any such committee
at any time, to fill vacancies thereon and to discharge any such committee,
either with or without cause, at any time. Each member of any such committee
shall be paid such fee, if any, as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors
for each meeting of such committee which he or she shall attend and for his
or her expenses, if any, of attendance at each regular or special meeting of
such committee as shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

 

Section 13\. _Action Without Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting if all

 



Exhibit B-7  members of the Board of Directors or of such committee, as the case may be,
consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors, or committee.

Section 14\. _Fees and Compensation_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Articles of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may, if it
so desires, authorize members of the Board of Directors to be compensated for
their expenses, if any, of attendance at each regular or special meeting of
the Board of Directors. Such compensation may, in the Board of Directors
discretion, also include a fixed sum for each meeting and an annual fee for
serving as a director, such as may be allowed by resolution of the Board of
Directors. Directors who are officers or employees of the Corporation may
receive, if the Board of Directors desires, fees for serving as directors.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude any director from
serving the Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation
therefor.

_Shares_

 

Section 1\. _Certificates of Shares_. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide
by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series
of its shares shall be uncertificated. Any such resolution shall not apply to
shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to
the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the
Board of Directors, every holder of shares represented by certificates shall
be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the Corporation
by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President
or Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation representing the number
of shares registered in certificate form; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
where any such certificate is signed (a) by a transfer agent or an assistant
transfer agent, or (b) by a transfer clerk acting on behalf of the Corporation
and a registrar, if the Board of Directors shall by resolution so authorize,
the signature of such Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President,
Treasurer, Secretary, Assistant Treasurer or Assistant Secretary may be
facsimiles thereof. In case any officer or officers of the Corporation who
shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been
used on, any such certificate shall cease to be such officer or officers,
whether by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate
shall have been delivered by the Corporation, such certificate may
nevertheless be adopted by the Corporation and be issued and delivered as
though the person or persons who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been affixed thereto, had not ceased to be
such officer or officers.

 



Exhibit B-10 Section 2\. _Share Ledger_. A record shall be kept by the Secretary, transfer
agent or by any other officer, employee or agent designated by the Board of
Directors of the name of the person, firm or corporation holding the shares
represented by such certificate, the number of shares represented by such
certificate, and the date of issuance thereof, and in case of cancellation,
the date of cancellation.

Section 3\. _Cancellation_. Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation
for exchange or transfer shall be cancelled, and no new certificate or
certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificate until
such existing certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in
cases provided for in Section 6 of this Article V.

Section 4\. _Transfers of Shares_. Transfers of shares of the
Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the
registered holder thereof, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of
attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation or with
a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 5 of
this Article V, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates, if any,
for such shares properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon. The
person in whose name shares stand on the books of the Corporation shall be
deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation;

transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all certificates
of shares to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.

 

Section 6\. _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates_. As a
condition to the issuance of a new certificate or uncertificated shares in
the place of any certificate theretofore issued and alleged to have been lost,
stolen, mutilated or destroyed, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may
require the owner of any such certificate, or his legal representatives, to
give the Corporation a bond in such sum and in such form as it may direct or
to otherwise indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made
against it on account of the alleged loss, theft, mutilation or destruction
of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or
uncertificated shares. Proper evidence of such loss, theft, mutilation or
destruction shall be procured for the Board of Directors, if required. The
Board of Directors, in its discretion, may authorize the issuance of such new
certificate or uncertificated shares without any bond when in its judgment it
is proper to do so.

 

Section 7\. _Record Date_.

 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board
of Directors, and which record date shall, unless otherwise required by law,
not be more than seventy (70) days before the date of such meeting. If the
Board of Directors so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date
for determining the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the
Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a
later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is

 



Exhibit B-11  held. A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to
vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the
adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
shareholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to vote
in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of shares or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall not be more than seventy (70) days prior
to such action. If no such record date is fixed, the record date for
determining shareholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the Articles of Incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than seventy (70) days
before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders. If no
record date for determining shareholders entitled to express consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board of
Directors, (i) when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by
law, the record date for such purpose shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is delivered to the Corporation in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date for
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

shares of the Corporation, the Board of Directors shall, by resolution, direct

shall be determined by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that no
such designation as capital shall be necessary if shares are being distributed
by the Corporation pursuant to a split-up or division of its shares.

 

(c) The Board of Directors may set apart out of the funds of the Corporation
available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may
abolish any such reserve.

seal. The corporate seal shall consist of a die bearing the name of the
corporation and the inscription, "Corporate Seal-Arizona." Said seal may be
used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or
reproduced or otherwise.
