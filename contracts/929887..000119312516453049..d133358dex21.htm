and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the fees set forth in&nbsp;Sections&nbsp;8.5(b), 8.5(c) and 8.5(d) or any portion of such fee, the Company shall pay to
Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as published in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment. In no event shall the Company be required to reimburse the Parent Expenses or pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion each, and in no event shall the aggregate payments pursuant
to Sections&nbsp;8.5(b), 8.5(c) and 8.5(d) exceed the amount of the Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, reimbursement of the Parent Expenses or payment of the Termination Fee shall each constitute liquidated
damages. </P>
