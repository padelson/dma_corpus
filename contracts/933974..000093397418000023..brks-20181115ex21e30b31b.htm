 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and in accordance with the CCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. The

 \t\t\t. The closing of the Transactions (the "Closing") shall take place at
10:00 a.m. (Boston time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time) at the
offices of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo, P.C., One Financial
Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, unless another time, date or place is
agreed to in writing by the Parties (the "Closing Date"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.3. Effective Time \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable
on the Closing Date, the Parties shall file with the Registrar of Companies in
the Cayman Islands an executed Cayman Plan of Merger in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D, and the other documents required to effect the
Merger as provided in Part XVI of the CCL. The Merger shall become effective
at the time the Cayman Plan of Merger is registered by the Registrar of
Companies in the Cayman Islands or at such later time as is agreed to by the
Parties and specified in the Cayman Plan of Merger (such later time being not
later than the 90th day after the date of such registration) (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the "Effective
Time"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.4. Effects of the Merger \t\t

action, and every other asset of Merger Sub and the Company, shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation without further act or deed and (c) all debts,

 \t\t\t(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its board of
directors shall, subject to applicable Law, take all actions necessary to give
effect to the transactions provided for in this Section 2.7.4 and to ensure

Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, and take all
actions necessary to ensure that the Company Option Plan and all individual
option agreements entered into pursuant to the Company Option Plan terminate
at the Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 2.11. Non-Conversion \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.11.1 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into
or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company

or similar rights by demanding and not effectively withdrawing or losing such
Holder's appraisal, dissenters' or similar rights for any shares of Company
Capital Stock by serving a written objection and a notice of dissent under
Sections 238(2) and 238(5) of the CCL, respectively, the Payments
Administrator shall deliver to Parent (a) such Holder's portion of the
Estimated Merger Consideration that is attributable to such shares at the time
such portion of such Estimated Merger Consideration is determined and such
rights are perfected and (b) such Holder's portions of the Further
Distributions, if any, allocable to such shares at the time such rights are
perfected and such portions are determined and are received by the Payments
Administrator from (i) the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement or (ii) Parent, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.11.2 Withdrawal or Loss of Rights. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 2.11.1, if any Holder of Dissenting Shares effectively
withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such Holder's
appraisal or dissenters' rights with respect to such shares under the CCL,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
(a) such Holder's shares shall automatically convert into and represent only
the right to receive the consideration for Company Capital Stock, as
applicable, set forth in and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, upon
surrender of the Certificate(s) formerly representing such shares and (b)
Parent (to the extent the following amounts have been previously delivered by
the Payments Administrator to Parent pursuant to Section 2.11.1 and not
returned to the Payments Administrator) or the Payments Administrator shall
deliver to such Holder (i) such Holder's portion of the Estimated Merger
Consideration that is attributable to such shares at the time such rights are
withdrawn or lost and (ii) such Holder's portions of the Further
Distributions, if any, attributable to such shares at the time such portions
are determined and, in the case of amounts to be distributed by the Payments
Administrator, received by the Payments Administrator from (1) the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement or (2) Parent, as
applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.11.3 Demands for Appraisal. The Company shall give Parent
(a) prompt notice of any objection, notices of dissent, written demand for
appraisal and any other instruments relating to dissent rights in connection
with the Merger received by the Company pursuant to Section 238 of the CCL and
(b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any such
demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any communication to
be made by the Company to any Stockholder with respect to such demands must be
submitted and consented to in writing by Parent prior to delivery to any such
Stockholder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12.1 Payment Procedures. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the Payments
Administrator shall send to each Stockholder of record: (i) a letter of
transmittal in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent (each, a "Letter of
Transmittal"), (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the
Certificates by the Payments Administrator and shall contain a release of
claims substantially in the form of Section 4 of the Joinder Agreements and an
appointment of Holders' Representative as provided for in Section 8.4) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for payment of the applicable portion of the Estimated Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender by a Holder of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Payments Administrator, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and such
other customary documents as may be reasonably required by the Payments
Administrator), the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, subject to Section 2.12.6, the consideration provided for
herein, in cash and the Certificate so surrendered shall thereafter be
canceled. If payment of any portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration is
to be made to any Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (y) the
Certificate so surrendered be accompanied by a duly executed share transfer
instrument in accordance with Section 2.12.2 and (z) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the applicable portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered Holder of the relevant shares
represented by such Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. After the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent only
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Estimated Merger
Consideration and the Further Distributions, if any, as contemplated by this
Article II. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) With respect to each Employee Holder of In-the-Money
Options, Parent shall, reasonably promptly following the Closing Date cause
the Surviving Corporation to deliver to such Holder through its payroll system
the consideration provided for herein, in cash. With respect to each non-
Employee Holder of In-the-Money Options, Parent shall cause the Payments
Administrator to pay, reasonably promptly following the Closing Date, to such
Holder the consideration provided for herein, in cash. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) No interest shall be paid on any amounts payable by the
Payments Administrator, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates upon
delivery of any Letter of Transmittal. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12.2 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company
Stock. The Estimated Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of
Company Capital Stock (together with the contingent right to receive, if, when
and to the extent payable, the Further Distributions) upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Capital Stock previously represented by such
Certificates and at the Effective Time, the register of members of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the register of members of the Surviving Corporation of the
shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence \t\t

Certificates are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12.3 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any
Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
the fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Payments Administrator, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as the Payments Administrator may reasonably
determine necessary and an indemnity against any claim that may be made with
respect to such Certificate, the Payments Administrator shall pay, subject to
Section 2.12.6, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration and the
applicable portion of the Further Distributions, if any, to be paid in respect
of the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated or required to
post a bond for any Holder for any reason in connection with a lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12.4 Termination of Exchange Fund. At any time after the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Payments Administrator to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Payments Administrator in
respect of the Estimated Merger Consideration and not disbursed to Holders,
and, thereafter, such Holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Estimated Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such Holders,
as determined pursuant to this Agreement. At any time after the first
anniversary of the date on which each Further Distribution (if, when and to
the extent payable) is payable, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Payments Administrator to deliver to it any amount distributed to the Payments
Administrator in respect of each such Further Distribution that has not been
disbursed to the Holders, and thereafter such Holders may look only to Parent
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any portion thereof that may
be payable upon surrender of any Certificates held by such Holders, as
determined pursuant to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12.5 No Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, following the first anniversary of the date on
which any amount is delivered to the Payments Administrator for payment, none
of the Parties or the Payments Administrator shall be liable to any Person for
any portion such amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.12.6 Withholding Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Payments Administrator and the Escrow Agent shall deduct and withhold from
that portion of the Estimated Merger Consideration or Further Distributions
otherwise payable to a Holder and shall pay to the appropriate Taxing
Authority such amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under any Tax Law; provided, that Parent
acknowledges and agrees that, except to the extent required by (i) an enacted
amendment to the applicable statute, \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) a ruling, notification or circular issued by the applicable
Taxing Authority, or (iii) a final and binding judgement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, in each case, following the date hereof, none of the
Parent, Company or the Surviving Corporation shall withhold on any such
payments (other than to any holder of an In-the-Money Option or other payments
that are considered compensatory for applicable Tax purposes, if any), unless
the Company fails to provide the FIRPTA Certificate described in Section
2.12.6(b) below, or a Holder does not provide an applicable IRS Form W-8 or
W-9. To the extent that there is (A) an enacted amendment to the applicable
statute, (B) a ruling, notification or circular issued by the applicable
Taxing Authority, or (C) a final and binding judgement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, in each case, (1) following the date hereof and (2)
requiring a deduction or withholding, prior to making any such deduction or
withholding from any non-compensatory amount payable to a Holder pursuant to
this Agreement, Parent provide written notice to Holders' Representative of
the obligation to deduct and withhold no fewer than five (5) Business Days
from the date that any such deduction or withholding is required; provided,
that if the amendment to the applicable statute, ruling, notification,
circular or judgement becomes effective or is issued within five (5) Business
Days from the date that any such deduction or withholding is required, Parent
shall provide written notice to the Company of the obligation to deduct and
withhold as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. Parent and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company) agree to (I) consult and cooperate in good
faith with Holders' Representative as to the ability to reduce any such
required withholding and deductions and (II) accept properly completed and
duly executed documentation that is provided at least one (1) Business Day
prior to the applicable payment that will permit any consideration otherwise
payable hereunder to be made without or at a reduced rate of withholding under
applicable Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid to a Taxing
Authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) On or prior to the Closing Date (but no earlier than ten
(10) days before the Closing Date), the Company shall deliver a duly executed
certificate in compliance with Sections 1.897-2(h)(2) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)(i) of

(but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 5.1), if between the
date hereof and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of any class or
series of Company Capital Stock are changed into a different number of shares
or a different class or series by reason of the occurrence or record date of
any share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the portion of the
Estimated Merger Consideration and Further Distributions payable to each
Holder shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such share dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange
of shares or similar transaction. \t\t

event shall the aggregate amounts to be paid to the Holders pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock and Company Options
exceed (a) in respect of the amounts payable at the Closing, the Estimated
Merger Consideration and (b) in respect of the amounts payable thereafter, the

the following: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the Closing Cash; \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) the resulting Final Merger Consideration. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSuch Final Merger Consideration Calculation shall be accompanied by
such supporting documentation reasonably necessary to derive the numbers set
forth therein. The Final Merger Consideration Calculation shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon the Parties unless Holders' Representative
delivers a written notice to Parent of any objection to the Final Merger
Consideration Calculation (the "Final Merger Consideration Calculation
Objection Notice") within thirty (30) days (the "Objection Period") after
delivery of the Final Merger Consideration Calculation to Holders'
Representative. Any Final Merger Consideration Calculation Objection Notice
must set forth in reasonable detail (i) the correct amount of any item on the
Final Merger Consideration Calculation that Holders' Representative believes
has not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) Holders'
Representative's alternative calculation of such item. Any Final Merger
Consideration Calculation Objection Notice must specify, with reasonable
particularity, all facts that form the basis of such disagreements and all
documents relied upon by Holders' Representative as forming the basis of such
disagreement. If Holders' Representative gives any such Final Merger
Consideration Calculation Objection Notice within the Objection Period, then
Holders' Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith to resolve any
dispute concerning the item(s) subject to such Final Merger Consideration
Calculation Objection Notice. If Holders' Representative and Parent do not
resolve the issues raised in the Final Merger Consideration Calculation
Objection Notice within thirty (30) days of the date of delivery of such
notice (the "Initial Resolution Period"), such dispute shall be resolved in

 \t\t\tbeen disputed in the Final Merger Consideration Calculation Objection
Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties on the expiration
of the Initial Resolution Period. During the Objection Period and the Initial
Resolution Period, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, provide Holders' Representative and its
Representatives with reasonable access (with the right to make copies), during
normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice, to the relevant
financial books and records of Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) and other items reasonably requested by Holders'
Representative and directly related to the matters disputed in the Final
Merger Consideration Calculation Objection Notice, together with the relevant
personnel and Representatives of Parent and its Affiliates relevant to
Holders' Representative's review of the Final Merger Consideration Calculation
and any dispute with respect thereto as contemplated by this Section
2.15. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t2.15.2 Resolution of Disputes. If Parent and Holders'
Representative have not been able to resolve a dispute within the Initial
Resolution Period, either party may submit such dispute to and such dispute
shall be resolved fully, finally and exclusively through the use of KPMG LLP
as an independent accounting firm. If KPMG LLP is not willing to serve as an
independent accounting firm for this purpose, then another independent
international accounting firm shall be selected to serve as such by mutual
agreement of Parent and Holders' Representative (such accounting firm, the
"Reviewing Party"). The fees and expenses of the Reviewing Party incurred in
the resolution of such dispute shall be borne by the Parties in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Holders and Parent from the resolution of the dispute. For example, if
Holders' Representative challenges the calculation of the Final Merger
Consideration in the Final Merger Consideration Calculation by an amount of
$100,000, but the Reviewing Party determines that Holders' Representative has
a valid claim for only $40,000, Parent shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses
of the Reviewing Party and Holders' Representative on behalf of the Holders
shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses. The Reviewing Party shall
determine (with written notice thereof to Holders' Representative and Parent)
as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days following
the date on which the Final Merger Consideration Calculation and written
submissions detailing the disputed items are delivered to the Reviewing Party
(a) whether the Final Merger Consideration Calculation was prepared in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or, alternatively, and (b) only
with respect to the disputed items submitted to the Reviewing Party, whether
and to what extent (if any) the resulting Final Merger Consideration
Calculation requires adjustment and a written explanation in reasonable detail
of each such required adjustment, including the basis therefor. Parent and
Holders' Representative shall require the Reviewing Party to enter into a
customary engagement agreement on terms agreeable to Parent, Holders'
Representative and the Reviewing Party. The procedures of this Section 2.15.2
are exclusive and, the determination of the Reviewing Party shall be final and
binding on the Parties. The decision rendered pursuant to this Section 2.15.2
may be filed as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
Reviewing Party shall be instructed to resolve the unresolved disputed items
in accordance with the definitions of Closing Cash, Closing Net Working
Capital, Company Transaction Expenses, Closing Company Debt and Accounts
Receivables and shall be instructed not to independently investigate any other
matters. In no event shall the decision of the Reviewing Party provide for a
calculation of any element of the Final Merger Consideration that is less than
the lower calculation thereof shown in the Final Merger Consideration
Calculation or the Final Merger Consideration Calculation Objection Notice or
greater than the higher calculation thereof shown in the Final Merger
Consideration Calculation or the Final Merger Consideration Calculation
Objection Notice. All communications between \t\t

 \t\t\t2.15.3 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. Promptly after
the Final Merger Consideration Calculation becomes final and binding on the
Parties under Section 2.15.1 and Section 2.15.2, \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) if the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the
Estimated Merger Consideration (the amount of any such shortfall, an
"Adjustment Surplus"), Parent shall pay an amount equal to such Adjustment
Surplus plus the Adjustment Holdback Amount to the Payments Administrator for
distribution to the Holders based on their respective Further Distributions
Per Share; provided, however, that any payments to be made in respect of In-
the-Money Options shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.7.4 and
Section 2.9.5; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) if the Final Merger Consideration is less than the
Estimated Merger Consideration (the amount of any such shortfall, an
"Adjustment Shortfall"), Parent shall be entitled to: (i) retain a portion of
the Adjustment Holdback Amount equal to the Adjustment Shortfall in
satisfaction thereof and (ii) if the Adjustment Shortfall exceeds the
Adjustment Holdback Amount, retain the entire Adjustment Holdback Amount and
recover such excess amount, first, from the Indemnity Escrow Funds until the
Indemnity Escrow Funds are depleted and, second, directly from the Holders (on
a several basis, based on their respective Indemnification Sharing
Percentage). If any part of the Adjustment Holdback Amount remains after the
final determination of the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.15, and payment to Parent of any Adjustment Shortfall, Parent shall pay such
amount to the Payments Administrator for distribution to the Holders based on
their respective Further Distributions Per Share; provided, however, that in
each such case, any payments to be made in respect of In-the-Money Options
shall be made in the manner specified in Section 2.7.4 and Section
2.9.5. \t\t

the Health Care Laws, applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries,

with all Laws applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as

 \t\t\tSection 3.9. Taxes \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.1 All income and other material Tax Returns that are
required to have been filed by or with respect to the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have been timely and duly filed (taking into account any valid
extension of time to file granted or obtained). All such Tax Returns were
true, correct and complete in all material respects. There is no extension of
time with respect to any date on which a Tax Return of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof is required to be filed is in force or was requested by the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof (other than ordinary extensions of the due
date for filing such Tax Return). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.2 All income and other material Taxes owed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been timely
paid in full to the appropriate Taxing Authority. There are no Liens for
Taxes (other than Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of the
assets of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.3 Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld
and timely paid all material amounts of Taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or any other third party. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has substantially complied with all record
keeping and information reporting requirements applicable to such withholding
Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.4 The unpaid Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries (a)
did not materially exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet and
(b) do not materially exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material
liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term
is used in GAAP, outside the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with past
custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.5 No agreement by the Company or any Subsidiary thereof
is in force for the waiver or extension of any statute of limitations with
respect to any Taxes, and no request for such waiver or extension is
outstanding, except, in each case, as a result of a valid ordinary course
extension of time to file a Tax Return. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.6 Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has
received written notice from any Taxing Authority of any audit or other
examination of any Tax Return that is presently in progress, pending or

received written notice from any Taxing Authority of any material Tax
deficiency that is outstanding, assessed or proposed against the Company or
any Subsidiary thereof and has not been resolved in full. Since January 1,
2015, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof has received notice or
other claim by any Taxing Authority in writing in a jurisdiction where the
Company or any such Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to Tax by that jurisdiction, and to the Company's Knowledge, there is
no basis for such claim to be made. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.8 The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has disclosed
on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a substantial understatement of federal
income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.9.9 Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) is
or has ever been a member of an affiliated group, consolidated, unitary or
similar group for income Tax purposes (other than a group of which the
Company is the common parent), (B) has any liability for Taxes of any person

 \t\t\t3.9.11 Neither the Company or any Subsidiary thereof nor Parent
(or any affiliate thereof) will be required to include an item of income in,
or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period

method of accounting requested prior to the Closing Date; (b) closing or
similar agreement entered into with any Taxing Authority on or prior to the

under Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision of any state, local,

income under Section 108(i) of the Code as a result of any transaction
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t\tNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties made by the Company and its Subsidiaries in

Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a Defined
Benefit Plan as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan") and
neither the Company or any Subsidiary thereof nor any other entity (whether or

have there been any fiduciary violations under ERISA that could subject the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any Employee) to any material penalty
or tax under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

determination or opinion letter from the IRS. Each UK Company Plan is
registered with HM Revenue and Customs in accordance with Part 4 of the

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3.1 Actions Required to Consummate Transactions. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and except as otherwise provided
in the Agreement, from the date hereof until the Closing Date or such earlier
date if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, (a) Parent shall
(and shall cause its Affiliates to) obtain all approvals, consents,
registrations, Permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Antitrust Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions (including the
Merger) (provided that the Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in
obtaining such approvals, consents, registrations, Permits, authorizations and
other confirmations, including by making any filings which are required to be
made by the Company in order to obtain such approvals, consents,
registrations, Permits, authorizations or other confirmations), (b) each Party
(other than the Holders' Representative) shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all approvals, consents,
authorizations and other confirmations from any Governmental Authority (other
than an Antitrust Authority) necessary to consummate the Transactions
(including the Merger), (c) each Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all approvals, consents,
authorizations and other confirmations from any third party (other than a
Governmental Authority, including an Antitrust Authority) necessary to
consummate the Transactions (including the Merger) and (d) each Party shall
(and shall cause its Affiliates to) use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable (other
than any actions specifically governed by the preceding clauses (a), (b) and
(c)) to cause the conditions to closing of the Parties hereunder to be
satisfied and to consummate and make effective the Transactions (including the
Merger), in each case of this Section 5.3.1, as expeditiously as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not, in order to comply with its
obligations contained in this Section 5.3.1, have any obligation to take, or
cause to be taken, any actions or do, or cause to be done, any things to
resolve or cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any representation or
warranty contained in Section 3.8 by the Company that may prevent obtaining
any approvals, consents, registrations, Permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3.2 Regulatory Filings. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in this Section 5.3, each
of the Parties (other than the Holders' Representative) shall (a) as promptly
as practicable (but not later than five (5) days after the date hereof) make
and effect all required filings and submissions under the HSR Act, (b) as
promptly as practicable (but not later than five (5) Business Days after the
date hereof) make and effect all required filings and submissions, if any,
required under the Antitrust Laws set forth on Section 5.3.2 of the Disclosure
Schedule and (c) as promptly as practicable provide all information requested
by any Governmental Authority under applicable Law in connection with the
Transactions. Each of the Parties shall, subject to applicable Laws, promptly
notify the other Parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions
(including the Merger) and shall, subject to applicable Laws, permit the other
Parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such Party to any
Governmental Authority with respect to such matters and consider in good faith
any comments promptly received from the other Parties with respect thereto.
No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting, discussion or call with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tinvestigation or other inquiry relating to the Transactions (including
the Merger) unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion or call.
Subject to applicable Laws, the Parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other Parties reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.
Subject to applicable Laws, the Parties shall promptly provide each other with
copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of
their authorized Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Transactions (including the Merger). Notwithstanding anything in this Section
5.3.2 to the contrary, each Party may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other Parties under this Section 5.3.2 as "outside counsel only" and may
redact materials as necessary to (i) remove references concerning valuation,
(ii) comply with contractual arrangements or (iii) address legal privilege or
other confidentiality concerns. All filing fees payable in connection with
the notifications, filings, registrations, submissions or other materials
contemplated by this Section 5.3.2 shall be paid entirely by Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3.3 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3 to the
contrary, Parent shall direct and control the strategy of the Parties to
obtain all approvals, consents, registrations, Permits, authorizations and
other confirmations from any Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, and in furtherance of and not in limitation of
Parent's undertaking pursuant to this Section 5.3, Parent agrees to take any
and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Law that is asserted by any Antitrust Authority so as to enable the
Parties hereto to consummate and make effective the Transactions (including
the Merger) prior to the Outside Date, including but not limited to
negotiating, committing to and effecting by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, license, lease, divesture or any other
disposition of any of Parent or any of its Affiliates' assets, product lines,
properties or businesses or of the Company or any of its Affiliates' assets,
product lines, properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant
hereto, and the entrance into any such other arrangements (each such action a
"Divestiture Action"), to ensure that no Antitrust Authority enters any order,
decision, judgment, decree, ruling or injunction (preliminary or permanent),
or establishes any law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or
permanently restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions (including the Merger), or to ensure that no Antitrust Authority
with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation
of the Transactions (including the Merger) under any Antitrust Laws, and whose
approval or authorization is necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions (including the Merger), fails to do so by the Outside Date. The
Company shall not, nor shall it cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
without Parent's prior written consent, commit to any Divestiture Action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the discretion of Parent, any Divestiture
Action may be conditioned upon the consummation of the Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.3.4 Contractual Consents. The Company and Parent shall
use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals of
any parties to any Material Contracts as are required thereunder in connection
with the Merger or for any such Material Contracts to remain in full force and
effect, so as to preserve all material rights of and material benefits to, the
Company and its Subsidiaries under such Material Contract from and after the
Effective Time; provided that nothing in this \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.3.4 shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Company
or its Subsidiaries to make or cause to be made any payment or concession to
any third party to obtain any such consent; provided, further, that the
obtaining of any such consents shall not be deemed to be a condition to the
obligations of the Parties to consummate the Transactions. Such consents,
waivers and approvals shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.4. Public Announcements \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. No public announcement or public disclosure will be made by any
Party with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the non-disclosing Parties; provided,
however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of
this Section 5.4 and Section 5.6 will not prohibit (a) any disclosure required
by any applicable Law (in which case the disclosing Party will provide the
other Parties with the opportunity to review the information to be disclosed
in advance of such disclosure), or (b) any disclosure made in connection with
the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.5. Access to Information \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.5.1 Access. (a) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement
and the requirements of applicable Law, the Company shall afford to Parent and
Parent's Representatives, and Representatives of the issuer of the RandW
Insurance Policy, from time to time prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time or (ii) the termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1,
reasonable access, during normal business hours upon reasonable advance
notice, to (a) all of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' Premises, books and
records (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form) (b) the
appropriate Representatives of the Company and (c) all other information and
documents concerning its business, financial condition and operations,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request and Parent shall be
allowed to make copies of such information and documents; provided, however,
that any such access or furnishing of information shall be conducted at
Parent's expense, under the supervision of the Company's personnel and in such
a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing shall require the Company to provide Parent or its Representatives, or
any Representatives of the issuer of the RandW Insurance Policy, with any access
or information that the Company reasonably believes, would (x) compromise or
constitute a waiver of any attorney-client or attorney work product privilege
or other legal privilege of the Company or its Affiliates, or (y) contravene
any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or Contract of the Company or its
Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that the Company shall notify Parent when
information and/or records are being withheld because of such a
restriction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) From and after the Closing, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide the Holders'
Representative and its agents (at the expense of the Holders) with reasonable
access (for the purpose of examining and copying), during normal business
hours, upon reasonable advance notice, under the supervision of Parent's
personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal operations
of the Surviving \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tCorporation and its Subsidiaries to the books and records of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries with respect to periods or
occurrences prior to the Closing Date and reasonable access, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, under the supervision of
Parent's personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal
operations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to employees of
each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and each of their respective
Affiliates, in each case for purposes of complying with any applicable tax,
financial reporting or regulatory requirements or any other reasonable
business purpose. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Holders'
Representative, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will, for a
period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date without first offering
to surrender to the Holders' Representative such books and records or any
portion thereof which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this
Section 5.5.1(b) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to provide any such access or furnish any such information
that it reasonably believes would (a) violate any applicable Law, (b)
compromise or constitute a waiver of any attorney-client or other privilege of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates
or (b) violate any covenant, agreement or obligation of the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary under a contract; provided, however,
that if Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries are so
restricted, they shall promptly notify the Holders' Representative that
information or records are being withheld and provide the Holders'
Representative with as much information as reasonably possible with respect to
such information or records. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.5.2 Updated Financials. Promptly, but in no event later
than ten (10) Business Days after the end of each month from the date hereof
until the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the
true and correct unaudited balance consolidated sheets and related statements
of income and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of and for the
period ended the most-recent month-end prepared using the books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied, together with a copy of the standard monthly reporting package
provided to the Company's management. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.6. Confidentiality \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.6.1 Holders' Representative shall, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives to, keep confidential all documents and information involving
or relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses
that Holders' Representative receives in such capacity (the "Confidential
Information"), unless (a) compelled to disclose such Confidential Information
by competent judicial process so long as reasonable prior notice of such
disclosure is given to Parent and the Company and a reasonable opportunity is
afforded Parent and the Company to contest the same, or (b) disclosed in an
Action brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its
remedies hereby (clauses (a) and (b) together, the "Confidential Information
Exceptions"). Confidential Information does not include any document or
information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other
than as a result of a disclosure in violation of this Section 5.6 \t\t

the receiving party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure
hereunder, (iii) becomes available to the receiving party on a non-
confidential basis from a person not known by the receiving party to be under
an obligation not to transmit the information to the receiving party or (iv)
is independently developed by the receiving party without reference to any of
the Confidential Information. The provisions of this Section 5.6 shall
survive the Closing Date indefinitely. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, following the Closing, the Holders' Representative
shall be permitted to disclose information to employees, advisors, agents or
consultants of the Holders' Representative and to the Holders in connection
with the Holders\' Representative\'s duties in connection with this Agreement,
in each case who have a need to know such information, provided that such
persons are subject to confidentiality obligations with respect thereto
(substantially similar as set forth herein). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.6.2 Parent acknowledges and agrees that any Confidential
Information made available to Parent or its Representatives pursuant to
Section 5.5 or otherwise by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.7. Notification of Certain Matters \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Prior to the Closing, each party shall provide prompt written
notice to the other parties upon becoming aware (a) of any written notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions (including the Merger), or (b) of the commencement or written
threat of commencement of any Action by a Governmental Authority regarding the
Transactions (including the Merger); provided, however, that neither the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7 nor obtaining any
information or knowledge in any investigation pursuant to Section 5.5 or
otherwise shall (i) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with, any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter, or any breach
of any other provision of this Agreement, (ii) amend or supplement any
scheduled disclosure made by the Company in Article III or (iii) limit the
remedies available to Parent, including remedies pursuant to Article II,
Article VI, Article VII or Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, a party's good faith failure to comply with this Section 5.7
shall not provide any other party the right not to effect the Transactions,
except to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement would
independently provide such right. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.8. Taxes \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.1 Transfer Taxes. Parent, on the one hand, and the
Holder Indemnifying Persons (severally and not jointly in accordance with such
Holder's Indemnification Sharing Percentage), on the other hand, shall each be
liable for fifty percent (50%) of any real property transfer or gains tax,
stamp tax, stock transfer tax or other similar Tax imposed as a result of the
Merger (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties or interest
with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The Parties shall cooperate in filing all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to the Transfer
Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, Transfer Taxes shall not include Non-
Resident Capital Gains Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.2 Straddle Period. To the extent permitted under
applicable Law, the Parties shall endeavor to end all taxable periods of the
Company and its Subsidiaries relating to income and similar Taxes on the
Closing Date. In the event that any taxable period of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries commences on or before, but ends after, the Closing Date
(such period, a "Straddle Period"), the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined
as follows: (a) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as
real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire
period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the
amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
Straddle Period ending on, and including, the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period
and (b) in the case of Taxes not described in clause (a) above (such as
franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts,
based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer
or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), subject
to Section 5.8.4(d), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if
such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing
Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.3 Cooperation. Following the Closing Date, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Holders' Representative shall, as reasonably
requested by any Party: (a) assist any other Party hereto in preparing and
filing any Tax Returns relating to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
that such other Party is responsible for preparing and filing, (b) cooperate
in preparing for any Tax contest, Tax audit of or dispute with any Taxing
Authority regarding and any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to
liability for Taxes, in the preparation or conduct of litigation or
investigation of claims and in connection with the preparation of financial
statements or other documents to be filed with any Taxing Authority, in each
case with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) make
available to the other Parties and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes relating to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (at the cost and expense of the requesting
Party), and (d) upon request from the other Party, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Taxing
Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the Merger. Parent,
its Affiliates and the Holders' Representative shall make themselves (and
their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide explanations of any documents or information made available
under this Section 5.8.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent shall retain, and shall cause its Affiliates to retain, all
Tax Returns, work papers and all material records or other documents in its
possession (or in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all Pre‑Closing Tax Periods and
Straddle Periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions and (ii) six (6) years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such
time, before Parent shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or
in the possession of its Affiliates), the Holders' Representative shall be
given an opportunity, after ninety (90) days prior written notice, to remove
and retain all or any part of such documents as Holders' Representative may
select (at Holders' sole expense). For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding any other provision in his Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any Affiliate thereof to
disclose any Tax Return or any other \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.4 Tax Returns and Public Notice 7 Submission. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Parent shall prepare and timely file (or cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to prepare and timely file) all Tax Returns (taking into
account any extension of time to file such Tax Returns)) that relate to the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are filed after the Closing Date (excluding
the Public Notice 7 Submission made by the Company pursuant to Section
5.8.4(b)); provided, that with respect to any Tax Return prepared by Parent
pursuant to this Section 5.8.4(a) relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period, (i) such Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries, unless a different
treatment of any item is required by applicable Law, (ii) (A) in the case of
any Tax Return that relates to Income Taxes (an "Income Tax Return"), Parent
shall provide Holders' Representative and its authorized representatives with
a draft copy of such Income Tax Return at least thirty-five (35) days prior to
the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Income
Tax Return and (B) in the case of any Tax Return that is not an Income Tax
Return, Parent shall provide Holders' Representative and its authorized
representatives with a draft copy of such Income Tax Return at least twenty
(20) days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the
filing of such Tax Return, (iii) Holders' Representative shall be deemed to
accept and agree with such draft Tax Return unless Holders' Representative
delivers a written notice within (A) twenty (20) days (in the case of an
Income Tax Return) or (B) ten (10) days (in the case of a Tax Return other
than an Income Tax Return), in each case, setting forth in reasonable detail
any disputed items with respect thereof, (iv) the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith and try to promptly resolve any disputes raised by Holders'
Representative in compliance with the provisions of clause (iii); provided
that if the Parties are unable to resolve in good faith any disputes within
five (5) days, any remaining disputes shall be submitted to a tax partner at
the Reviewing Party for prompt resolution and the principles of Section 2.15.2
shall apply with respect thereof. If the Reviewing Party is unable to make a
determination with respect to any disputed item prior to the due date for the
filing of the Tax Return in question, then (x) the Parent may file (or cause
the Company to file) such Tax Return in accordance with the Parents reasonable
position with respect to such disputed items as reflected in the draft Tax
Return provided to the Holders' Representative, and (y) if the Reviewing Party
subsequently determines that such Tax Return should be amended, Parent shall
file (or cause the Company to file) an amended Tax Return reflecting the
determination of the Reviewing Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) No later than twenty (20) days following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a draft of the proposed
submission in compliance with Section 9 of Public Notice 7, a report of the
Transaction to the applicable PRC Taxing Authorities (including all
information required by Section 9 of Public Notice 7) (the "Public Notice 7
Submission"). The Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable
comments provided by Parent no later than six (6) days following receipt by
Parent of the draft Public Notice 7 Submission. The Company shall submit the
Public Notice 7 Submission (incorporating such reasonable comments made by
Parent for which the Company decides to incorporate into the Public Notice 7
Submission after considering any such comments in good faith) to the PRC
Taxing Authorities (including all information required by Section 9
identifying Company, Parent and Holders' Representative as interested parties
with respect thereto). \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) With respect to a Tax that was reflected as a current
liability in the final calculation of Closing Net Working Capital: (i) if, at
the time the annual Tax Return for the applicable Tax period is filed in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.8.4, such Tax is determined to be
below the amount attributed to such Tax in the final calculation of Closing
Net Working Capital, Parent shall remit the net amount of such excess in
accordance with the provisions of clause (iii) below, (ii) if, pursuant to a
Contest governed by Section 5.8.6, it is finally concluded that amount of Tax
attributed to a Liability for Tax reflected in the final calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital (as adjusted for any decrease in the amount of
such Taxes that resulted in any excess payment by Parent pursuant to the
provisions of clause (i) above) is lower than the amount of such Tax as was
reflected in the annual Tax Return for the applicable Tax Period that was
filed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.8.4, Parent shall remit
the net amount of such excess in accordance with the provisions of clause
(iii) below; and (iii) Parent shall remit the net amount of such excess
described in clause (i) or (ii) above within five (5) days after a Tax Return
referred to in clause (ii) above was filed or a Tax Contest referred to in
clause (ii) above was finally concluded, as the case may be, to the Payments
Administrator and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and shall be
available for distribution to the Holders based on their respective Further
Distributions Per Share in accordance with this Agreement, provided that prior
to the release of all General Tax Escrow Funds pursuant to Section 8.3.7(c),
such excess shall not be remitted to the Payments Administrator or the
Surviving Corporation but to the Escrow Agent and shall be treated as an
additional General Tax Escrow Amount subject to the provisions of Section
8.3.7(c). For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax with respect to which Parent
remitted amounts in accordance with the provisions of clause (iii) above shall
be treated as Covered Taxes for which the Holder Indemnifying Parties are
responsible under Section 8.2.1(a)(iii)(A). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In preparing all Tax Returns, the Parties agree that, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, all deductions arising as a
result of the payment, accrual or incurrence of (i) any item reflected as a
Liability in the final calculation of Company Transaction Expenses or (ii) the
cancellation of Company Options pursuant to Section 2.7.4 shall, in each case,
be allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.5 Refunds. To the extent not reflected as current Tax
asset in the final calculation of Closing Net Working Capital, any refund (or
credit or offset that, at a taxpayer's option, is elected in lieu of a cash
refund), including any interest paid or credited by a Taxing Authority with
respect thereto, of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, excluding any Tax refund (or
credit or offset that, at a taxpayer's option, is elected in lieu of a cash
refund) attributable to (i) a carry back or other use of any item of loss,
deduction, credit, offset or other similar item arising in any Tax period (or
a portion thereof) commencing after the Closing Date, and (ii) any Non-
Resident Capital Gains Tax (but only to the extent paid by Parent or its
Affiliates and not from the Special Tax Escrow), shall be for the benefit of
the Holders. Parent shall pay the net amount of such Tax refunds (or credit
or offset that, at a taxpayer's option, is elected in lieu of a cash refund),
net of any Taxes imposed thereon and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred with respect thereto, over to the Payments Administrator and the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, no more than five (5) Business Days
following receipt of such Tax refund (or credit or offset that, at a
taxpayer's option, is elected in lieu of a cash refund), which refund amount
shall be available for distribution to the Holders based on their respective
Further Distributions Per Share in accordance with this Agreement. Following
a reasonable written request by Holders' Representative and at the \t\t

 \t\t\tHolders' sole expense, Parent shall cause its Affiliate(s) to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Tax refund (or credit or offset
that, at a taxpayer's option, is elected in lieu of a cash refund) to which
the Holder Indemnifying Persons are entitled under this Section 5.8.5.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that
any such refund of Taxes (or credit or offset that, at a taxpayer's option, is
elected in lieu of a cash refund) is subsequently determined by any Taxing
Authority to be less than the amount paid by Parent as set forth above, such
disallowed or otherwise reduced amount shall be treated as a Covered Tax for
which the Holder Indemnifying Parties are responsible under Section
8.2.1(a)(iii)(A). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.6 Contests. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) After the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, promptly notify Holders' Representative in writing and the
Equityholders shall or shall cause Holders' Representative to promptly notify
Parent in writing, as the case may be, regarding (i) the proposed assessment
or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
or of any demand or claim with respect to any Covered Taxes, Non-Resident
Capital Gains Taxes or any Covered Withholding Taxes, which, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for
indemnification under Section 8.2.1(a)(iii) or Section 8.2.1(b)(iii) and (ii)
any communications from the PRC Taxing Authorities relating to the Public
Notice 7 Submission, provided, however, that no delay on the part of either
party in giving any such notice shall relieve an Indemnifying Person of any
indemnification obligations unless, and only to the extent that, such
Indemnifying Person is actually prejudiced by such delay. Such notice shall
include copies of any notice or other document received from any Taxing
Authority in respect of any such matter. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In the case of any audit, examination, contest, litigation,
appeal, settlement discussion or other proceeding against any Taxing Authority
(a "Contest") that relates to either the Taxes of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries solely for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or
any Covered Withholding Taxes, which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer
or after the lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification under Section
8.2.1(b)(iii) (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt with respect to Non-
Resident Capital Gains Taxes and any discussions with the PRC Taxing
Authorities with respect to the Public Notice 7 Submission), Holders'
Representative shall have the right, at the Holders' sole cost and expense, to
assume the control the conduct of such Contest by delivering a written notice
to Parent no later than twenty (20) days after receipt of written notice
regarding the commencement of such Contests, provided that (i) the Holders'
Representative shall diligently defend such Contest and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such
Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Parent of any related
correspondence, and providing Parent with an opportunity to review and comment
on any material correspondence before Holders' Representative sends such
correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (ii) Holders' Representative consult
with Parent in connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Contest,
(iii) Parent shall have the right (at Parent's cost and expense) to
participate in (but not control) the defense of such Contest (including
participating in any discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities
regarding such Contest), and (iv) Holders' Representative shall not settle or
compromise any such Contest without first obtaining the prior written consent
of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If
Holders' Representative does not elect to control any such Contest, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and \t\t

 \t\t\tits Subsidiaries) to (i) diligently defend the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with such Contest, (ii) keep Holders'
Representative reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Holders'
Representative of any related correspondence, and providing Holders'
Representative with an opportunity to review and comment on any material
correspondence before Parent sends such correspondence to any Taxing
Authority), (iii) consult with Holders' Representative in connection with the
defense or prosecution of any such Contest, (iv) provide Holders'
Representative the right (at the Holders' cost and expense) to participate in
(but not control) the defense of such Contest (including participating in any
discussions with the applicable Taxing Authorities regarding such Contest),
and (v) not settle or compromise any such Contest without first obtaining the
prior written consent of Holders' Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) provided, that Parent agrees that it shall
be unreasonable for Parent to object a settlement or a compromise of such
Contest if such settlement or compromise will not increase the amount of Taxes
payable by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) in a Post-Closing Tax Period or impose any restrictions or
limits on the activities of Parent or of any its Affiliates (including the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) in a Post-Closing Tax Period. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent that it is ultimately determined that
Covered Taxes or Covered Withholding Taxes are due in connection with any
Contest that is controlled by Parent or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, any reasonable costs and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries) in connection with any such Contest shall constitute
Losses caused by, as a result of or arising out of, Covered Taxes or Covered
Withholding Taxes, as the case may be. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In the case of any Contest that relates to a Straddle
Period, Parent shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to direct
and control, through counsel of its own choosing, any such Contest; provided,
(i) Parent shall keep Holders' Representative reasonably informed regarding
the progress and substantive aspects of such Contest (including promptly
forwarding copies to Holders' Representative of any related correspondence,
and providing Holders' Representative with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before Parent sends such correspondence
to any Taxing Authority), (ii) Parent shall consult with Holders'
Representative in connection with the defense or prosecution of any such
Contest, (iii) Holders' Representative shall have the right (at the Holders'
cost and expense) to participate in (but not control) the defense of such
Contest (including participating in any discussions with the applicable Taxing
Authorities regarding such Contest), and (iv) Parent shall not settle or
compromise any such Contest without first obtaining the prior written consent
of Holders' Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) As long as the Special Tax Escrow Funds have not been
substantially depleted or otherwise released (other than in the case of a
Contingent Release but only to the extent Holders are still liable for the
related Losses in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.2.4(d)(z)),
Parent and Holders' Representative shall jointly control (with each party
bearing its respective cost and expense) any Contest that relates to Non-
Resident Capital Gains Taxes (including any discussions with the PRC Taxing
Authorities with respect to the Public Notice 7 Submission). As part of such
joint control, Parent and the Holders' Representative shall (i) keep each
other reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of
such Contest, (ii) promptly forwarding copies to each other of any related
correspondence, (iii) provide each other with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tsending any correspondence to the PRC Taxing Authorities, (iv) consult
with each other in connection with the defense or prosecution of any such
Contest, (iii) allow each other to participate and jointly control in the
defense of such Contest (including participating in any discussions with the
PRC Taxing Authorities regarding such Contest), and (iv) shall not settle or
compromise any such Contest without first obtaining the prior written consent
of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
For the avoidance of doubt, Parent agrees that it shall be unreasonable for
Parent to object a settlement or a compromise of such Contest that does not
result in any other obligations or limitations on Parent, or any of its
Affiliates, if the amount of Non-Resident Capital Gains Taxes that would be
due by Parent or any of its Affiliates as a result settlement of comprise of
any such Contest would not exceed the remaining Special Tax Escrow Funds.
Once the Special Tax Escrow Funds have been substantially depleted or
otherwise released (other than in the case of a Contingent Release but only to
the extent Holders are still liable for the related Losses in accordance with
the provisions of Section 8.2.4(d)(z)), Parent shall have the sole right to
control Contest that relates to Non-Resident Capital Gains Taxes to which
Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party to. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(i) this Section 5.8.6 shall control with respect to any Contest, and (ii)
Parent shall have no obligation to disclose to Holders' Representative any Tax
information or allow Holders' Representative to participate in any discussion
relating to Tax, in each case to the extent attributable to an affiliated,
consolidated, unitary, combined or similar group for Tax purposes of which the
Company is a member following the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.7 Tax Covenants. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5.8.4,
5.8.5 and 5.8.6, as applicable, Parent shall not (i) amend, refile or
otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, (ii) file a Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period in a jurisdiction where the Company and/or its Subsidiary has
not previously filed a Tax Return, (iii) grant an extension of any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to a Tax Return of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (other than
ordinary course extensions of time within which to file Tax Returns), or (iv)
enter into any voluntary disclosure Tax program, agreement or arrangement with
any Taxing Authority that relates to the Taxes of any of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Parent shall not make, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to not make, any election with
respect to any the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any election
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 or an election under
Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code), which election would be effective on
or prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t\t5.8.8 NOLs and Deferred Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) If the NOL Value is less than the Deferred Taxes, the
Parent shall be indemnified from and against such shortfall (the "NOL
Shortfall") and any Liabilities with respect thereof in accordance with the
provisions of Section 8.2.1(a)(vii). For the avoidance of doubt, the
determination of NOL Shortfall, Available NOLs and/or Deferred Taxes shall be
updated, as needed, to take into account the filing of applicable Tax Returns,
payment of applicable Taxes, and or the resolution or other settlement of any
applicable audit, examination, contest, litigation, appeal, settlement
discussion or other proceeding against any Taxing Authority. Parent shall
deliver to Holders' Representative a schedule setting forth in reasonable
detail the calculation of the NOL Shortfall in conjunction with any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2.1(a)(vii). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) For purposes of this Agreement: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) "Available NOLs" means the excess, if any, of (A) the
balance of net operating losses of the Company for U.S. federal and applicable
state and local income tax purposes as of the end of the Closing Date
(determined by taking into account any deductions or other tax attributes with
respect to the payment of Company Transaction Expenses, the cancellation of
Company Options pursuant to Section 2.7.4 and any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and by allocating any such items, to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period) over (B) the portion of any prepaid amount (1) received by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and (2) that is
properly taken into account in the income of Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) in a Post-Closing Tax Period for
U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, but only to
the extent that such prepaid amount is taken into account in manner that
results in an increase (or a lower reduction) to the Final Merger
Consideration (taking into account (1) any Cash received with respect to any
such prepaid amount that is reflected in the final calculation of Closing Cash
and (2) any deferred revenue or customer deposits related to such prepaid
amount that are reflected in the final calculation of Net Working Capital or
Company Debt, as applicable). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) "Deferred Taxes" means any Tax liability of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that is not fully paid as of the Closing arising under
Section 965 of the Code (and any corresponding provision of State and local
Tax law). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) "NOL Value" means the aggregate value of net cash Taxes
saved by Parent and its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) as a result of the utilization of Available NOLs (determined on
a with and without basis) in the three (3) tax years ending after the Closing
Date; provided, that NOL Value shall be computed (A) by taking into account
any limitations on the utilization of Available NOLs under Section 382 of the
Code (or any corresponding provisions of applicable state and local Tax Law)
or otherwise under applicable Tax Law and (B) by disregarding the utilization
of any Available NOLs to the extent that the utilization of any such Available
NOLs gives rise to a refund (or credit or offset that, at a taxpayer's option,
is elected in lieu of a cash refund) that is for the benefit of the Holders
pursuant to Section 5.8.5. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.9. Officers and Directors Insurance \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9.1 The Parties agree that, to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law, all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liability for acts or omissions occurring in connection with
or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Closing, a manager, director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ("DandO Indemnified Persons"), including as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents the Organizational Documents of each of its
Subsidiaries, or any Contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any DandO Indemnified Person, will survive the Closing and will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period
of not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date (or, in the case of any
Contract, in accordance with its terms), and will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any DandO Indemnified Person. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9.2 Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall obtain a prepaid extended reporting period or tail policy
insuring the DandO Indemnified Persons under the current program of directors'
and officers' liability insurance or employment practices liability insurance
maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which shall be effective
commencing with the Closing Date and ending six (6) years thereafter and which
shall afford coverage for actual or alleged acts or omissions occurring at,
during or prior to the Closing Date including with respect to the Transactions
(including the Merger), in each case, on terms with respect to such coverage
and amounts at least as favorable to such Persons as those of such policies in
effect on the date hereof (for purposes hereof, all such policies, the "DandO
Tail Insurance"). The Company and Parent shall bear the cost of such
insurance coverage equally. Parent shall not, and, following the Closing,
shall not allow the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to,
amend, waive, modify or terminate the DandO Tail Insurance. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9.3 If the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(or any of their respective successors or assigns) transfers all or
substantially all of its equity interests, properties or assets to any Person,
through any single transaction or combination of transactions of any kind,
then, and in each such case, Parent will cause proper provision to be made so
that such Person fully assumes the obligations set forth in this Section
5.9. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.9.4 This Section 5.9 shall be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, any DandO Indemnified Person, and in each case, their
respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and estates,
and such Persons shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this Section
5.9 but only for such purposes. \t\t

no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (b) target-level
cash incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the
target-level cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided,
however, that (x) the Continuing Employees who have executed Offer Letters
will continue to participate in the Company's current applicable annual
incentive plan through the remainder of the current performance period of such
plan and thereafter participate in the Parent's incentive compensation plan on
a pro-rata basis based on the period of their participation in the Parent's
incentive compensation plan, and (y) the Continuing Employees who have not
executed Offer Letters will continue to participate in the Company's
applicable annual incentive plan for the 2018 and 2019 performance periods of
such plan and thereafter participate in the Parent's incentive compensation
plan on a pro-rata basis based on the period of their participation in the
Parent's incentive compensation plan, (c) severance benefits in amounts and on
terms and conditions that are no less favorable than those provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (d) other
compensation and employee benefits (other than equity based compensation or
benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than all other
compensation and employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 5.10.1 will
obligate Parent or any Affiliate thereof to continue the employment of any
Company Employee for any specific period after the Effective Time. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t5.10.2 Recognition of Service. With respect to any employee
benefit plan in which any Continuing Employee first becomes eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the "New Plans"), Parent shall
make commercially reasonable efforts to: (a) waive or cause to be waived all
waiting periods or pre-existing condition or other exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee
under any New Plan that is a health and welfare plan; (b) recognize or cause
to be recognized service of all Continuing Employees (to the extent credited
by the Company or its Subsidiaries) accrued prior to the Effective Time for
all purposes (other than for the purposes of defined benefit accrual under any
defined benefit pension plan, and except as would result in the duplication of
benefits for any period); and (c) credit or cause to be credited, if
applicable, including through adjustments to health savings accounts, any
deductibles or out of pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and

5.10 shall give rise to any obligation by Parent to retain any Current
Employee or to continue any Company Plan following the Closing Date. This
Section 5.10 is not intended to amend any benefit plans or arrangements of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to limit the ability of Parent or any of

 \t\t

 \t\t\tGENERAL PROVISIONS \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.1. Interpretation \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. The following rules shall apply to the interpretation and
construction of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1.1 Provisions. When a reference is made in this Agreement
or another Transaction Agreement to an "Article," "Section," "Exhibit" or
"Schedule," such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit
or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used
in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, such words shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof,"
"herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement unless otherwise expressly indicated in the
accompanying text. The use of "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless
otherwise expressly indicated in the accompanying text. The defined terms
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms.
Reference to the masculine gender shall be deemed to also refer to the
feminine gender and vice versa. A reference to documents, instruments or
agreements also refers to all addenda, exhibits or schedules thereto. Any
reference to a provision or part of a Law shall include a reference to that
provision or part as it may be renumbered or amended from time to time and any
successor provision or part or any renumbering or amendment thereof unless
otherwise indicated herein. References to "deliver," "furnish," "provided" or
"made available" means that such documents or information referenced have been
delivered to Parent or its Representatives or contained in the Company's
electronic data room. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1.2 No Presumption. The Parties have participated jointly
in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event any
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall
be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall be used to favor or disfavor any Party by virtue of the authorship
of any provision of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1.3 References to Article VIII. Any and all references to
Article VIII in this Agreement shall mean a reference to Exhibit H attached
hereto and any and all references to Article VIII (and any section,
subsection, clause or subclause thereof) in this Agreement shall mean a
reference to the corresponding section, subsection, clause or subclause of
Article VIII attached hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.2. Notices \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. All notices, waivers, consents and other communications to any
Party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when
personally delivered, (b) when receipt is electronically confirmed, if sent by
facsimile or email of a PDF document, (c) one Business Day after deposit with
a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with
proof of receipt or (d) three (3) Business Days after being sent by registered

 \t\t\tSection 9.3. Assignment and Succession \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by any of the Parties
without the written consent of the other Parties, except that Parent or Merger
Sub may, without the prior consent of any other Party, (a) assign any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any
controlled Affiliate of Parent; (b) assign this Agreement and any of its
rights and obligations hereunder to the purchaser of all or substantially all
of its equity securities or assets by merger, contract or otherwise in one
transaction or a series of related transactions; and (c) collaterally assign
any rights (but not obligations) under this Agreement to any of its lenders;
provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of
its obligations hereunder. Any assignment of this Agreement or any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder not permitted under this Section
9.3 shall be null and void ab initio. Subject to the foregoing terms of this
Section 9.3, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.4. Amendment or Supplement \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended at any time by execution of an instrument in writing identifying
itself as an amendment signed, when amended prior to the Closing, by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company and, when amended on or after the Closing, by
Parent, the Company and Holders' Representative. For purposes of this Section
9.4, the Holders that have signed Joinder Agreements have agreed pursuant
thereto that any amendment of this Agreement consented to by Holders'
Representative shall be binding on and enforceable against them, whether or
not they have signed this Agreement or such amendment. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.5. Waivers \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid and
binding unless it is in writing and signed by the Party against whom the
waiver is to be effective. No failure on the part of any Party in exercising
any right, privilege or remedy hereunder and no delay on the part of any Party
in executing any right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right hereunder. No notice to or demand on a Party made hereunder
shall operate as a waiver of any right of the Party giving such notice or
making such demand to take further action without notice or demand as
permitted hereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.6. Entire Agreement \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits
hereto, the other Transaction Agreements and the other documents referred to
herein which form a part hereof and the Confidentiality Agreement, contain the
entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
contained herein and therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous, agreements, arrangements, contracts, discussions,
negotiations, undertakings and understandings (whether written or oral)
between the Parties with respect to such subject matter (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Joinder Agreements). Upon the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate and none of the
Parties shall have any further Liability or obligation thereunder. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.7. No Third-Party Beneficiaries \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except as set forth in Section 5.9.4, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than
the Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under this
Agreement, except that after the Effective Time, Releasees, Parent Indemnified
Persons and Holder Indemnified Persons shall be third-party beneficiaries for
purposes of enforcing the provisions of Section 5.14 and Article VIII. For
the avoidance of doubt, no consent of any Releasee or Indemnified Person shall
be necessary to amend any provision of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.8. Remedies Cumulative \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except for resolution of disputes regarding the Final Merger
Consideration Calculation provided in Section 2.15, all rights and remedies of
each of the Parties shall be cumulative and the exercise of any one or more
rights or remedies shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or
remedy available hereunder or under applicable Law. Except as set forth in
Section 8.3.13, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
(i) any Party's remedies with respect to claims arising out of or in
connection with fraud, (ii) any Party's right to seek specific performance or
the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief, including a
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim or
conservatory relief, pursuant to Section 9.9 to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, or
(iii) any Party's rights or remedies under any Transaction Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.9. Specific Performance \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. The Parties agree that the Parties would be irreparably harmed if
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms and that any breach of this \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAgreement by any Party could not be compensated adequately by monetary
damages alone. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in addition to any other
remedy to which they may be entitled to at Law or in equity, the non-breaching
Parties shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent
injunctive relief or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including the right of the non-breaching Parties to compel the
other Parties to cause the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject
to conditions set forth in this Agreement) without having to prove irreparable
harm or that monetary damages would be inadequate. The Parties expressly
waive any requirement under any Law that non-breaching Parties obtain any bond
or give any other undertaking in connection with any Action seeking injunctive
relief or specific performance of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
The Parties further agrees that in the event of any Action for specific
performance relating to this Agreement or the Merger, it shall not assert and
hereby waives the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate or that
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason in Law or
equity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.10. Severability \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any term or
provision of the Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under any Law
or public policy, the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect if the economic and legal substance of this Agreement
and the Merger shall not be affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Any such term or provision found to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable only in part or in degree shall remain in full force and effect
to the extent not invalid, illegal or unenforceable. Upon the determination
that any term or provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties
intend that such provision shall be construed by modifying or limiting it so
as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent possible under applicable
Law and compatible with the consummation of the Transactions as originally
intended. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.11. Costs and Expenses \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Except as otherwise specified herein, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, each Party shall pay all costs and expenses it has incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger; provided, however, that the
Company and Parent shall each bear 50% of the following: (i) the RandW
Insurance Policy premium, (ii) the cost for any filing made as required under
any Antitrust Law (including the HSR Act) and (iii) the cost of the DandO Tail
Insurance. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.12. Counterparts \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original copy of this Agreement and all of which,
when taken together, shall constitute one instrument. The exchange of copies
of this Agreement and manually executed signature pages by transmission by
facsimile or by email of a PDF of a handwritten original signature or
signatures to the other Parties shall constitute effective execution and
delivery of this Agreement and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement
for all purposes. The signature of a Party transmitted by facsimile or other
electronic means shall be deemed to be an original signature for any
purpose. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.13. Governing Law \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. This Agreement and all claims or causes of Action (whether sounding
in contract or tort) arising under or related to this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements or the Merger, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any rule
or principle that might refer the governance or construction of this Agreement
to the Laws of another jurisdiction, except that the CCL and the other
applicable Laws of the Cayman Islands shall be held to govern the
Merger. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.14. Exclusive Jurisdiction; Venue; Service of
Process \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. In any Action between any of the Parties arising under or related
to this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the Merger, each of the
Parties (a) knowingly, voluntarily, irrevocably and unconditionally consents
and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or to the extent that such court does not accept
jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in
accordance with clause (a) of this Section 9.14, (c) waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any such Action in such courts, including any objection
that any such Action has been brought in an inconvenient forum or that the
court does not have jurisdiction over any Party and (d) agrees that service of
process upon such Party in any such Action shall be effective if such process
is given as a notice in accordance with Section 9.2. The Parties agree that
any Party may commence a proceeding in a court other than the above-named
courts solely for the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one
of the above-named courts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.15. JURY TRIAL \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. EACH OF THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNDER
THE PROFESSIONAL ADVICE OF COUNSEL WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY
LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR THE MERGER
BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.16. Representation and Privilege \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t. Parent and Merger Sub agree, that, following the Closing, Shearman
and Sterling LLP may serve as counsel to the Holders and the Holders'
Representative and their Affiliates in connection with any matters related to
this Agreement and the Transactions, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions
notwithstanding any representation by Shearman and Sterling LLP prior to the
Closing Date of the Company. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby (a)
waive any claim they have or may have that Shearman and Sterling LLP has a
conflict of interest in such representation or is otherwise prohibited from
engaging in such representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Parent and any of the Holders or any
of their respective Affiliates arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, Shearman and Sterling LLP may represent the Holders or any of
their respective Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to Parent or its Affiliates and even though
Shearman and Sterling \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tLLP may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related
to such dispute. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company also further agree that,
as to all communications involving attorney-client confidences prior to
Closing among Shearman and Sterling LLP and the Company, Holders or their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, in connection with the Transactions
(the "Closing Legal Communications"), the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to the Holders and may be controlled
by the Holders' Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns, on the one hand, and a
third party, on the other hand, after the Closing, Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third
party; provided, however, that the Company may not waive such privilege with
respect to the Closing Legal Communications without the prior written consent
of the Holders' Representative. \t\t
