merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Merger"). Upon
consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company

of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

         D.       Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the holders of capital stock of the Company representing at least
51% of the voting capital stock of the Company are executing and delivering
to Parent a voting agreement (a "Voting Agreement") of even date herewith
substantially in the form of Exhibit B.

                                    AGREEMENT

         The parties to this Agreement intending to be legally bound hereby

part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

         conversion of all Company Preferred Stock and (y) all shares of Company
         Common Stock issued upon exercise of any Company Warrant prior to the

         Closing Price (as defined below) shall be less than $27.72550 (the
         "Lower Collar"), then the number of Merger Consideration Shares shall
         be equal to 8,806,818;

                                    (2)      In the event the Parent Average
         Closing Price shall be greater than $34.02675 (the "Upper Collar"),
         then the number of Merger Consideration Shares shall be equal to
         7,175,926; and

                                    (3)      In the event the Parent Average
         Closing Price shall be equal to or greater than the Lower Collar and
         equal to or less than the Upper Collar, then the number of Merger
         Consideration Shares shall be equal to 244,173,438 divided by the
         Parent Average Closing Price.

For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Average Closing Price" means the
average of the closing sale price of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten trading days ending on the
second trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (rounded to the
nearest hundredth).

                           (ii)     each share of the common stock (par value
         $0.001 per share) of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
         Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
         Surviving Corporation.

immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a
repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company which
condition by its terms does not terminate upon consummation of the Merger,
then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of
Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates
representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked
with appropriate legends.

                  (d)      A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in the Merger shall be delivered into escrow and held as specified in
Section 1.8 hereof.

                  (e)      In the event Parent at any time or from time to
time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time declares or
pays any dividend on Parent Common Stock payable in Parent Common Stock or in
any right to acquire Parent Common Stock, or effects a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (by stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like), or in the event the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Parent Common Stock, then the

         1.6      STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

                  (a)      At the Effective Time, the Company's 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance
with Section 5.12.

                  (b)      At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of capital stock of the Company that is then outstanding, whether
vested or unvested (a "Company Option"), shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plan (as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement) and the stock option agreement by which such Company Option
is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under
outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time, (i) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for
shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable
Fraction, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, (iii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall be
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction, and rounding the resulting
exercise price up to the nearest whole cent and (iv) all restrictions on the
exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall continue in full force and
effect, except to the extent that such restrictions by their terms terminate
upon consummation of the Merger, and the term, exercisability, vesting
schedule and other provisions of such Company Option (including, without
limitation, provisions relating to the acceleration of options upon
termination of an employment or consulting relationship after a change of
control) shall otherwise remain unchanged and shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as set forth in the Stock Plan
and/or stock option agreement by which such Company Option is evidenced
immediately prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each such
assumed Company Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to
further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction effected
by Parent after the Effective Time. The Company and Parent shall take all
action that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section
1.6. Following the Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an assumed
Company Option a written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such assumed Company Option and (ii) the
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
such assumed Company Option. It is the intention of the parties that the
Company Options assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
that such Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall file with the SEC no later than ten
business days after the Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8
registering the exercise of any Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to
this Section 1.6. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement for so long as such
Company Options remain outstanding. Parent shall take all necessary corporate
action to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Options assumed in accordance
with this Section 1.6(b).

                                     4.
<PAGE>

                  (c)      At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant (if any)
that is then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms
(as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the instrument by which such
Company Warrant is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company capital stock
under outstanding Company Warrants shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time,
(i) each Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such assumed Company Warrant shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable Fraction, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the per share
exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such
assumed Company Warrant shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent and (iv) all
restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Warrant shall continue
in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability and other provisions of
such Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged except to the extent that
such restrictions or other provisions by their terms terminate upon consummation
of the Merger; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each such assumed Company Warrant shall,
in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization
or other similar transaction effected by Parent after the Effective Time. Parent
shall take all necessary corporate action to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company
Warrants assumed in accordance with this Section 1.6(c).

         1.7      CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective
Time, holders of certificates representing shares of the Company's capital
stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, and the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of
such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No
further transfer of any such shares of the Company's capital stock shall be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any of such
shares of the Company's capital stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section
1.8.

         1.8      EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; ESCROW SHARES.

                  (a)      At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
reserve for exchange in accordance with this Section 1, (i) the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash for
fractional shares in the amount described in Section 1.8(c). At the Closing,
each Company stockholder that does not perfect its appraisal rights and is
otherwise entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.5 (a "Merger Stockholder") shall surrender to Parent all
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (properly endorsed
for transfer). At or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall (i) deliver to each Merger Stockholder a certificate representing 90%
of the number of whole shares

                                     5.

of Parent Common Stock that such Merger Stockholder has the right to receive

Stockholder, a certificate representing 10% of the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such Merger Stockholder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 (the "Escrow Shares"). If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any
certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

                  (b)      No dividends or other distributions declared or
made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to
any such holder, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate
in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be
entitled receive all such dividends and distributions and such cash payment).

                  (c)      No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any
holder of capital stock of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, upon
surrender of such holder's Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Parent Average Closing Price.

                  (d)      The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger shall be characterized as "restricted securities" for purposes of
Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and each certificate representing any such
shares shall, until such time that the shares are not so restricted under the
Securities Act, bear a legend identical or similar in effect to the following

state securities laws or otherwise, if any):

             "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT

        AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED,
        ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE
        ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
        OF THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

                  (e)      Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise

Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to deduct or withhold

the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

                  (f)      Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for
any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant

                  (g)      The Escrow Shares shall be maintained in an escrow

shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder
or holders in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if the status of any such shares as Dissenting Shares shall not
be perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, or if any such shares shall lose their status as Dissenting
Shares then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure
to perfect such status or the loss of such status, such shares shall
automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive
(upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
shares) Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5.

                  (b)      The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any written demand received by the Company at or prior to the Company

other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any

of default by a landlord, or event that, with the giving of notice or the
passage of time or both would constitute a breach or event of default by a

Except as stated in Schedule 2.9(c)(ii), the Customers under the Collocation
Agreements have accepted possession of their respective spaces under the
Collocation Agreements and all improvements and construction required to be
performed by the Acquired Companies under the Collocation Agreements have
been completed. There are no leasing commissions or other commissions, fees
or compensation presently owed or which will become due and payable with
respect to any of the Collocation Agreements or which could become due and
payable in the future upon the exercise of any right or option contained in
any of the Collocation Agreements other than any payments due to employees of

practice. Except in favor of Parent as contemplated by Section 5.9 hereof, no
Acquired Company has assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered in any

                  (d)      Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Acquired Companies, the construction, work or other improvements required to
be made by the Acquired Companies pursuant to the Leases (the "Tenant
Improvements") were performed in accordance with the requirements of the Leases
and all plans, specifications, drawings and permits applicable thereto and are
permitted, conforming improvements under currently applicable zoning and
building laws and ordinances, including without limitation the Americans with
Disabilities Act, and to the Company's Knowledge, the present uses thereof are
permitted conforming uses under applicable zoning and building laws and
ordinances. The Acquired Companies have obtained lien waivers from each
contractor or sub-contractor for any Tenant Improvements performed, except to
the extent that failure to obtain such waivers would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Acquired Companies. Except as disclosed in Part 2.9(d)(i) of the

Improvements, free and clear of all material Encumbrances. Except as disclosed

which are installed and connected pursuant to valid permits and, to the
Company's Knowledge, are in full compliance with all statutes, ordinances and
regulations, except to the extent that failure to comply would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Companies. No fact or condition exists
with respect to the Acquired Companies which would result in the termination or
material impairment in the furnishing of utility services as required by the
Leases or the Collocation Agreements to any Leased Real Property. To the
Company's Knowledge, no fact or condition exists with respect to any Person
other than any of the Acquired Companies which would result in the termination
or material impairment in the

                                      16.

<PAGE>

furnishing of utility services as required by the Leases or the Collocation

the Disclosure Schedule, the cost of installation and connection of all the
Utilities presently servicing such Leased Real Property has been fully paid

the Acquired Companies' New York City facility as to available electrical
power, to the Company's Knowledge, the Company or a Subsidiary has adequate
electrical power for 10,000 square feet of collocation space assuming the
tenant improvements contemplated by the Company Operating Plan are made. With

subleased to a third party.

landlord consents and/or provided all necessary landlord notices in accordance
with the terms and conditions of any relevant Lease for any assignment, sublease
or other transfer by and between any Acquired Company, as tenant under the
relevant Lease, and any other Acquired Company or third party, except to the
extent that failure to obtain such landlord consents and/or provided such
landlord notices would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired
Companies.

                  (g)      The Property has at all times been managed, operated,
maintained and repaired by the Acquired Companies in accordance with sound
property management practice or as otherwise required by the Leases and the
Collocation Agreements. There are no physical or mechanical defects or
deficiencies in the condition, design, construction, fabrication, manufacture or
installation of any of the Tenant Improvements or any part thereof or any
system, element or component thereof, except such defects or deficiencies that
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Companies. All systems,
elements and components of each of the Tenant Improvements are in good working
order and repair and sound operating condition, except as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Companies. No Acquired Company has
received any notice of any kind from any insurance broker, agent or underwriter

exists in, on or about any Leased Real Property or any part thereof.

Asset.

                  (d)      The Proprietary Assets identified in Part 2.10 of the
Disclosure Schedule constitute all the material Proprietary Assets necessary to
enable the Acquired Companies to conduct their business in the manner currently

after the execution of this Agreement, and in no event later than ten business
days after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare an Information
Statement relating to the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
Company's stockholders and the exercise of appraisal rights in connection
therewith (the "Information Statement"). The Company shall provide and include
in the Information Statement such information relating to the Company and its
stockholders as may be required pursuant to the provisions of applicable
securities and corporate laws (including, without limitation, Rule 502 under the
Securities Act). The Company shall, in accordance with its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the applicable requirements of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, call and hold a special meeting of its stockholders as promptly
as practicable, and in any event no later than June 30, 2000, for the purpose of
permitting them to consider and to vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and
the approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Company Stockholders' Meeting"). The Company shall cause a copy
of the Information Statement to be delivered to each stockholder of the Company
who is entitled to vote on the Merger. As promptly as practicable after the
delivery of copies of the Information Statement to all stockholders entitled to
vote at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to solicit from each of such stockholders a
proxy in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to solicit from
each of such stockholders a proxy in favor of approval of items necessary to
prevent any payment or benefit that a Company employee or consultant may receive
in connection with the Merger from being considered a "parachute payment" under
Section 280G of the Code; (iii) to cause each of such stockholders who is not an
"accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act) to
retain a "purchaser representative" (as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities
Act) in connection with evaluating the merits and risks of investing in Parent
Common Stock and (iv) to cause each of such stockholders to execute and deliver
to Parent a Stockholder Representation Letter substantially in the form of
Exhibit E-1 hereto. In lieu of calling and holding the Company Stockholders'
Meeting, the Company may solicit written consents (to be effective on or prior
to June 30, 2000) in accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and the applicable requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Parent
will reasonably cooperate with the Company with respect to the matters set forth
in this Section 5.2. Parent will promptly provide all information relating to
its business or operations necessary for inclusion in the Information Statement
to satisfy all requirements of applicable state and federal securities and
corporate laws.

         5.3      COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS. During the Pre-Closing
Period, (a) the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 6

                                       36


<PAGE>

to be satisfied on a timely basis and (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section
7 to be satisfied on a timely basis.

         5.4      TERMINATION OF AGREEMENTS. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all provisions in
Contracts that provide any Person with rights of any nature with respect to the
board of directors of any Acquired Company (except as provided generally by such
Acquired Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) or by applicable law) are validly and effectively
terminated as of the Effective Time.

         5.5      RELEASES. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Key Employees to execute and deliver to the Company and
Parent a Release substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto.

         5.6      PROTECTION OF PROPRIETARY ASSETS. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all current and former employees,
consultants and independent contractors that are or were involved in the
creation, invention, research or development of the Company Proprietary Assets,
to execute and deliver to the Company an agreement that is substantially
identical to the form of Parent's Confidentiality, Nonraiding and Noncompetition
Agreement.

         5.7      ESCROW AMENDMENT. To the extent the Company requests during
the Pre-Closing Period, the parties agree to amend this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement to provide that $200,000 of the Merger Consideration would be paid in
cash instead of shares of Parent Common Stock and that such funds would be
deposited into an account for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to the Company's instructions, which funds will be used by the
Stockholders' Agent to pay for its expenses in fulfilling its duties as
Stockholders' Agent.

         5.8      TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. Parent and the Company shall each use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain an
opinion of its respective counsel to such effect as contemplated by Section 7.8.
Parent and the Company shall each execute and deliver the tax representation
letters substantially in the form of Exhibit J. From and after the Effective
Time, neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall take any action that
could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger not to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         5.9      BRIDGE FINANCING. Simultaneously herewith, Parent and the
Company are executing a Credit Agreement pursuant to which Parent is committing
to lend up to $25,000,000 to the Company on the terms and conditions set forth
therein, including the security documents attached as exhibits to such Credit
Agreement, subject to the granting and perfection of Parent's security interests
in certain assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, which Parent and the
Company will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish no later
than June 1, 2000 (the "Bridge Facility"). Except in the event of (i) a breach
of this Agreement by the Company which would constitute a Material Adverse
Effect on the Acquired Companies or (ii) a breach of this Section 5.9 by the
Company, if Parent has not perfected its security interest under the Bridge
Facility by June 1, 2000, or fails to make the initial advance under the Bridge
Facility by such

                                      37

<PAGE>

date for any reason, Parent shall within two business days thereof loan to
the Company $5,000,000 on substantially the terms set forth in the form of
credit agreement and promissory note attached hereto as Exhibit M (the
"Interim Facility").

         5.10     DISCLOSURE. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Representatives to, issue any press release or otherwise publicly
disseminate any document or other written material relating to the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless (i)
Parent shall have approved such press release or written material (it being
understood that Parent shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of any
such press release or written material), or (ii) the Company shall have been
advised by its outside legal counsel that the issuance of such press release
or the dissemination of such written material is required by any applicable
law or regulation, and the Company shall have consulted with Parent prior to
issuing such press release or disseminating such written material. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that none of its
Representatives makes any public statement that is materially inconsistent
with any press release issued or any written material publicly disseminated
by the Company with respect to the Merger or with respect to any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to consult with the Company prior to issuing any press release or
making any public statement regarding the Merger.

         5.11     RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL; LEASES.

                  (a)      During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall have a
right of first refusal with respect to the sale, lease or licensing of any
lot greater than 150 square feet of an Acquired Company's currently available
collocation space in Houston, Texas and/or Waltham, Massachusetts (a
"Collocation Space Transaction"). The Company shall, and shall cause each
Subsidiary to, give Parent the right to purchase, lease or license any
collocation space lot greater than 150 square feet on the same terms as any
other Person has made a bona fide offer to purchase, lease or license such
collocation space from an Acquired Company.

                           (i)      Prior to any Collocation Space Transaction
         by an Acquired Company, the Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of
         its intention to enter into such Collocation Space Transaction, setting
         forth in reasonable detail the terms of such proposed Collocation Space
         Transaction, including the identity of the Person who has made the bona
         fide offer with respect to such Collocation Space Transaction. Within
         five business days after receipt of such notice, Parent shall notify
         the Company whether Parent exercises its option and elects to enter
         into the Collocation Space Transaction.

                           (ii)     If, within five business days after the
         Company delivers its notice pursuant to Section 5.11(a)(i), Parent does
         not notify the Company that Parent desires to enter into the
         Collocation Space Transaction described in such notice upon the terms
         and conditions set forth in such notice, the Company may, during a
         period of sixty days following the end of such five-business-day
         period, enter into such Collocation Space Transaction with another
         Person upon the same general terms and conditions as those set forth in
         the notice to Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure by Parent to
         exercise its option to enter into any Collocation Space Transaction
         shall not affect its option to enter into any subsequent Collocation
         Space Transaction. In the event an Acquired Company

                                           38

<PAGE>

         does not enter into the Collocation Space Transaction within said
         60-day period, no Acquired Company shall thereafter enter into such
         Collocation Space Transaction without first offering such
         transaction to Parent in the manner provided above.

                  (b)      During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquired
Companies shall make available to Parent at least 2,500 square feet of the
13,000 square feet of collocation space currently anticipated to be built out
in Atlanta, Georgia in accordance with the Company Operating Plan. Parent
will lease such 2,500 square feet from the Acquired Companies at $72,000 per
month, commencing on the later of (i) such time as such space is built and
available for use and (ii) August 1, 2000, on substantially the other terms
and conditions set forth in that certain Collocation Sublease and Service
Schedule A-1, dated January 21, 2000 (the "Collocation Sublease").

                  (c)      During the Pre-Closing Period, the Acquired
Companies shall make available to Parent at least 5,000 square feet of the

and conditions set forth in the Collocation Sublease.

         5.12     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (a)      At the Effective Time, the Stock Plan will be
assumed by Parent. After the Effective Time, awards under the Stock Plan will
be granted in the form of shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (b)      To the extent permitted by the Acquired Companies'
agreement with HR Logic, immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless
Parent consents otherwise in writing, the Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, or to withdraw from
participation in, any Pension Plan that is set forth in Part 2.16(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of HR Logic to the termination of its agreement with HR
Logic as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  (c)      All rights of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to repurchase unvested shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Repurchase Options") shall continue in effect following the Merger, except
to the extent that such rights by their terms terminate upon consummation of
the Merger (including by virtue of the amendments contemplated by this
Agreement and the schedules hereto, including Schedule 4.2(i) hereto), and
shall thereafter continue to be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms and
conditions in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the
shares purchasable pursuant to the Repurchase Options and the purchase price
per share shall be adjusted to reflect the Applicable Fraction.

         5.13     ACCOUNTING. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the deferred compensation charge
described in Part 2.4(i) of the Disclosure Schedule to be accounted for on the

be any Legal Requirement enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger that
makes consummation of the Merger illegal.

         7.8      TAX OPINION. Parent and the Company shall have received
written opinions from their respective tax counsel (Cooley Godward LLP and
Goulston & Storrs, respectively), in customary form, to the effect that the
Merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and such opinions shall not have been withdrawn, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if counsel to either Parent or the Company does not render such opinion,
this condition shall nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied if the other party's
counsel renders such opinion to such party. In rendering the opinion
contemplated by this Section, counsel may rely upon reasonable representations
and certificates of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, including the tax
representation letters substantially in the form of Exhibit J.

SECTION 8. TERMINATION

         8.1      TERMINATION EVENTS. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the Closing:

                  (a)      by Parent if the timely satisfaction of any condition
set forth in Section 6 has become impossible (other than as a result of any
failure on the part of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or perform any
covenant or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in
any other agreement or instrument delivered to the Company);

                  (b)      by the Company if the timely satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Section 7 has become impossible (other than as a result
of any failure on the part of the Company to comply with or perform any covenant
or obligation set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement or
instrument delivered to Parent);

                  (c)      by Parent if the Closing has not taken place on or
before August 31, 2000 (other than as a result of any failure on the part of the
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of
Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement or
instrument delivered to the Company);

                  (d)      by the Company if the Closing has not taken place on
or before August 31, 2000 (other than as a result of the failure on the part of
the Company to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument delivered to
Parent);

                  (e)      by either Parent or the Company if a court of
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a final and
nonappealable order, decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action,
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger; or

                  (f)      by the mutual written consent of Parent and the
Company.

         8.2      TERMINATION PROCEDURES. If Parent wishes to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(c), Parent shall deliver to
the Company a written notice stating that Parent is terminating this Agreement
and setting forth a brief description of the basis on

                                       45.
<PAGE>

which Parent is terminating this Agreement (the "Parent Termination Notice").
If the Company believes that the basis asserted by Parent for termination in
a Parent Termination Notice pursuant to Section 8.1(a) may be cured without
causing any condition set forth in Section 6 to become impossible to satisfy
prior to August 31, 2000, it shall so notify Parent in writing (a "Company
Objection Notice") within five business days of the Parent Termination
Notice, and the Company shall have until the earlier of 30 days from the date
of receipt of the Parent Termination Notice or August 31, 2000 to cure the
alleged failure of condition. If no such Company Objection Notice is
delivered to Parent within such five business day period, then upon the
expiration of such period, the Parent Termination Notice shall become
effective and this Agreement shall terminate. If the Company wishes to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or Section 8.1(d), the
Company shall deliver to Parent a notice, in writing, stating that the
Company is terminating this Agreement and setting forth a brief description
of the basis on which it is terminating this Agreement (the "Company
Termination Notice"). If Parent believes that the basis asserted by the
Company for termination in a Company Termination Notice pursuant to Section
8.1(b) may be cured without causing any condition set forth in Section 7 to
become impossible to satisfy prior to August 31, 2000, it shall so notify the
Company in writing (a "Parent Objection Notice") within five business days of
the Company Termination Notice, and Parent shall have until the earlier of 30
days from the date of receipt of the Company Termination Notice or August 31,
2000 to cure the alleged failure of condition. If no such Parent Objection
Notice is delivered to the Company within such five business day period, then
upon the expiration of such period, the Company Termination Notice shall
become effective and this Agreement shall terminate.

         8.3      EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1 and 8.2, all further obligations of the parties under
this Agreement shall terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that: (a) none of the parties
shall be relieved of any obligation or liability arising from any prior willful
breach by such party of any provision of this Agreement and (b) the parties
shall, in all events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the
provisions set forth in Sections 10.3, 10.5, 5.10, the second sentence of
5.11(b) and the second sentence of 5.11(c).

SECTION 9. INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

         9.1      SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      The representations and warranties made by the
Company (including the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2)
shall survive the Closing and shall expire on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Termination Date"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, at any time
prior to the Termination Date, any Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to
the Stockholders' Agent a written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy
in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company
(and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such Indemnitee's belief
that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Termination Date until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. All representations and warranties
made by Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire as of the Closing Date,
and any liability of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to such representations
and warranties shall thereupon cease, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Merger
Stockholders shall preserve any rights they may have against Parent pursuant to
federal and/or state securities laws, including, without limitation, the
antifraud provisions thereof

                                       46.
<PAGE>

(including, without limitation, any rights related to any untrue statement of
a material fact by Parent or omission by Parent of a material fact required
to be stated or necessary to make statements by Parent, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading).

                  (b)      The representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations of the Company, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by
the Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of
any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or Knowledge of, any
of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

                  (c)      For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or
other item of information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or in any update
to the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty
made by the Company in this Agreement, and each statement or other item of
information set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule or in any update to the
Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty
made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement.

         9.2      INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a)      From and after the Closing Date (but subject to
Section 9.1(a), 9.2(b), 9.3 and the other limitations set forth in this Section
9), the stockholders of the Company who shall have received, or shall be
entitled to receive, Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5 of this
Agreement (the "Indemnitors"), severally (and not jointly) and in proportion to
their original contributions to the Escrow Fund, shall hold harmless and
indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and the Escrow Shares shall
be available to compensate and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any
Damages, net of any Damage Exclusions, that are suffered or incurred by any of
the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees otherwise become subject
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party claim) and
that arise from or as a result of: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 2 (as modified by the Disclosure
Schedule) as of the date of this Agreement and as if such representation and
warranty had been made on and as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to
any "Material Adverse Effect on the Acquired Companies" or other materiality
qualification or any similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or
indirectly in such representation or warranty except to the extent that an
inaccuracy relates to information that was not required to be listed on the
Disclosure Schedule as a result of a materiality or Material Adverse Effect on
the Acquired Companies qualification in such representation or warranty, and
giving effect to any update to the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing); (ii) any
breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company (including the covenants set
forth in Sections 4 and 5); or (iii) any Legal Proceeding relating to any
inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to in clause "(i)" or "(ii)" above
(including any Legal Proceeding commenced by any Indemnitee for the purpose of
enforcing any of its rights under this Section 9); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that,
except as set forth in Section 9.3 with respect to claims based upon willful
fraud, the aggregate amount for which the Indemnitors are required to indemnify
the Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 9.2 will not exceed the Escrow Shares
held in the Escrow Fund.

                  (b)      DEDUCTIBLE. The Indemnitors shall not be required to
make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a) until such time as
the total amount of all

                                       47.
<PAGE>

Damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one
or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Indemnitees
has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds $2,000,000 in the aggregate. If
the total amount of such Damages exceeds $2,000,000, then the Indemnitees
shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed
only for the portion of such Damages exceeding $2,000,000.

         9.3      EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, if anything, with the exception of
claims based upon willful fraud, from and after the Closing, recourse of Parent
to the Escrow Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the other Indemnitees for Damages
under the indemnification provisions contained in, and for any breach of any
provision of, this Agreement.

         9.4      NO CONTRIBUTION. No stockholders of the Company shall have any
right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against
Merger Sub or the Company in connection with any indemnification obligation or
any other liability to which she, he or it may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.

         9.5      DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. In the event of the assertion
or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
Merger Sub or the Company, against Parent or against any other Person) with
respect to which any of the Indemnitors may, in Parent's reasonable judgment,
become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its
election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its
own. The Merger Stockholders shall be entitled, at their expense, to participate
in any defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding. If Parent so proceeds with the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

                  (a)      each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any
     documents and materials in his or its possession or control that may be
     necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

                  (b)      Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or
     compromise such claim or Legal Proceeding only with the consent of the
     Stockholders' Agent (as defined in Section 10.1); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
     such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Parent shall give the Stockholders' Agent prompt notice of the commencement of
any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the Stockholders' Agent
shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors under this Section 9
(except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such
Legal Proceeding). If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any
such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Stockholders' Agent may proceed with the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and the expense of said defense shall be paid out of the Escrow Fund;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Stockholders' Agent may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld).

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                                       48.
<PAGE>

         10.1     STOCKHOLDERS' AGENT. By virtue of their approval of the Merger
and this Agreement, the Merger Stockholders shall have approved, among other
matters, the indemnification and escrow terms set forth in Section 9 and the
expense reimbursement provisions in Section 10.3 and shall irrevocably appoint
such Person or Entity as a majority in interest of the Merger Stockholders shall
appoint prior to the Closing as their agent for purposes of Section 9 and
Section 10.3 (the "Stockholders' Agent") to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, cash or
other property from the Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand dispute
resolution pursuant to Section 3 of the Escrow Agreement and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to indemnification claims, and
to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders' Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Parent shall be
entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders' Agent on all matters
relating to Section 9 and Section 10.3, and shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document
executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Indemnitor by the
Stockholders' Agent, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Indemnitor by the Stockholders' Agent, as fully binding upon such
Indemnitor. If the Stockholders' Agent shall die, become disabled or otherwise
be unable to fulfill his responsibilities as agent of the Indemnitors, then a
majority in interests of the Indemnitors shall, within ten days after such death
or disability, appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter, shall notify
Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall become the
"Stockholders' Agent" for purposes of Section 9, Section 10.3 and this Section
10.1. If for any reason there is no Stockholders' Agent at any time, all
references herein to the Stockholders' Agent shall be deemed to refer to the
Indemnitors. The Stockholders' Agent shall not be responsible for, and the
Merger Stockholders by virtue of their approval of the Merger and this Agreement
shall be deemed to release the Stockholders' Agent from, any loss suffered by,
or liability of any kind to, the Merger Stockholders arising out of any act done
or omitted by the Stockholders' Agent in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholders' Agent's duties hereunder, unless such act or
omission involves willful fraud or other willful misconduct by the Stockholders'
Agent. The reasonable costs and expenses, including those of any legal counsel
or other professional retained by the Stockholders' Agent, in connection with
the acceptance and administration of the Stockholders' Agent's duties hereunder
(the "Agent Costs and Expenses") shall be paid as follows: (i) the Agent Costs
and Expenses, if any, for general administrative services other than in
connection with Claim Notices (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) shall be paid
by the Merger Stockholders; (ii) in the event an Indemnitee delivers a Claim
Notice and shares are released to such Indemnitee pursuant to Section 3(c) of
the Escrow Agreement (i.e., a non-contested Claim) with respect to such Claim
Notice, Agent Costs and Expenses with respect to such Claim Notice shall be paid
by the Merger Stockholders; and (iii) in the event an Indemnitee delivers a
Claim Notice and the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice (as defined
in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such Claim Notice indicating that there
is a Contested Amount (as defined in the Escrow Agreement), Agent Costs and
Expenses with respect to such Claim Notice shall be paid by Parent if the
Indemnitee who delivered such Claim Notice is deemed to be the non-prevailing
party pursuant to the last sentence of Section 3(f) of the Escrow Agreement with

                                       49.
<PAGE>

respect to the matters set forth in such Claim Notice and shall be paid by the
Merger Stockholders if the Merger Stockholders are deemed to be the
non-prevailing party pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Escrow Agreement with
respect to the matters set forth in such Claim Notice. By virtue of their
approval of the Merger and this Agreement, the Merger Stockholders hereby agree
to pay Agent Costs and Expenses as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence. Subject to the prior right of Parent to make claims for Damages, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Fund prior
to any distribution to the Merger Stockholders, any Agent Costs and Expenses
required to be paid by the Merger Stockholders pursuant to this Section 10.1. To
the extent the Escrow Fund is not sufficient to satisfy in full any obligations
of the Merger Stockholders to the Stockholders' Agent, the Merger Stockholders
shall, promptly after receipt of notice from the Stockholders' Agent of their
pro rata portion of such Agent Costs and Expenses, reimburse the Stockholders'
Agent for such Agent Costs and Expenses.

         10.2     FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereto shall execute and cause
to be delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents,
and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or
evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         10.3     FEES AND EXPENSES. Parent shall bear and pay all fees, costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, legal, accounting and investment
banking fees incurred by the Company) that have been incurred or that are
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company's proposed initial
public offering and private placement (collectively, the "Transaction Costs");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall have no obligation to bear and pay the
Transaction Costs of the Company if the Merger is not consummated; and PROVIDED
FURTHER, that Parent shall have no obligation to bear and pay (i) any
Transaction Costs that are legal fees, accounting fees and/or expenses
(including expenses of any investment banking firm that are reimbursed by the
Company) of the Company that exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate or (ii) any
Transaction Costs that are investment banking fees of the Company that exceed 1%
of the value of the Parent Common Stock issued at the Closing, such excess
Transaction Costs to be borne and paid by the Merger Stockholders by deducting
from the Escrow Fund a number of shares of Parent Common Stock having an
aggregate value equal to (i) the amount of such legal fees and expenses of the
Company that exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate and (ii) such amount of the
investment banking fees and expenses of the Company that exceed 1% of the value
of the Parent Common Stock issued at the Closing plus reasonable expenses in the
aggregate.

         10.4     ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought
against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other
relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

         10.5     NOTICES. Any notice or other communication required or
permitted to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by
hand, by registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by
facsimile) to the address or facsimile telephone number set forth beneath the
name of such party below (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number
as such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other
parties hereto):

         10.8     COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when
taken together, shall constitute one agreement.

         10.9     GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with, and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of
Delaware (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

         10.10    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon
each of the parties hereto and each of their respective successors and assigns,
if any. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of: the Company; Parent;
Merger Sub; the other Indemnitees; and the respective successors and assigns, if
any, of the foregoing. In connection with a transaction, or series of related
transactions, as a result of which a single stockholder or stockholders acting
as a "group" acquire a majority in interest of the voting securities of Parent,
Parent may freely assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement
(including its indemnification rights under Section 9), in whole or in part, to
any other Person that acquires control of Parent without obtaining the consent
or approval of any other party hereto or of any other Person provided that such
Person expressly assumes all of Parent's obligations set forth in this
Agreement.

         10.11    REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The rights and
remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative).
Subject to Section 9.3, the parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by a party to this Agreement of any covenant,
obligation or other provision set forth in this Agreement for the benefit of any
other party to this Agreement, such other party shall be entitled (in addition
to any other remedy that may be available to it) to (a) a decree or order of
specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant, obligation or other provision and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach.

         10.12    WAIVER. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part
of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy;
and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim
arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or
remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

         10.13    AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may not be amended, modified,
altered or supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

         10.14    SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any Person or set of
circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to
which it is

         8.6 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Voting Agreement or any
part of any such provision is held under any circumstances to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (a) such provision or part thereof
shall, with respect to such circumstances and in such jurisdiction, be deemed
amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest possible extent, (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of such
provision or part thereof under such circumstances and in such jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision or part
thereof under any other circumstances or in any other jurisdiction, and (c) the
invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the
validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Voting Agreement. Each
provision of this Voting Agreement is separable from every other provision of
this Voting Agreement, and each part of each provision of this Voting Agreement
is separable from every other part of such provision.

         8.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Voting Agreement, the Proxy and any other
documents delivered by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
parties with respect thereto. No addition to or modification of any provision of
this Voting Agreement shall be binding upon either party unless made in writing
and signed by both parties.

         8.8 ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT. Except as provided herein, neither
this Voting Agreement nor any of the interests or obligations hereunder may be
assigned or delegated by Stockholder, and any attempted or purported assignment
or delegation of any of such interests or obligations shall be void. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Voting Agreement shall be binding upon Stockholder
and his heirs, estate, executors, personal representatives, successors and
assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Parent and its successors and
assigns. Without limiting any of the restrictions set forth in Section 2 or
elsewhere in this Voting Agreement, this Voting Agreement shall be binding upon
any Person to whom any Subject Securities are transferred. Nothing in this
Voting Agreement is intended to confer on any Person (other than Parent and its
successors and assigns) any rights or remedies of any nature.

         8.9 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Voting Agreement or
the Proxy was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached. Stockholder agrees that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by Stockholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Voting Agreement or in the Proxy, Parent shall be entitled (in addition to any
other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages) to seek
and obtain (a) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the
observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction
restraining such breach or threatened breach. Stockholder further agrees that
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining
any remedy

                                       6
<PAGE>

referred to in this Section 8.8, and Stockholder irrevocably waives any right
he may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond
or similar instrument.

         8.10 NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The rights and remedies of Parent under this
Voting Agreement are not exclusive of or limited by any other rights or remedies
which it may have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of
which shall be cumulative (and not alternative). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the rights and remedies of Parent under this Voting Agreement,
and the obligations and liabilities of Stockholder under this Voting Agreement,
are in addition to their respective rights, remedies, obligations and
liabilities under common law requirements and under all applicable statutes,
rules and regulations. Nothing in this Voting Agreement shall limit any of
Stockholder's obligations, or the rights or remedies of Parent, under any
Affiliate Agreement between Parent and Stockholder; and nothing in any such
Affiliate Agreement shall limit any of Stockholder's obligations, or any of the
rights or remedies of Parent, under this Voting Agreement.

                  (b)      Any legal action or other legal proceeding relating
to this Voting Agreement or the Proxy or the enforcement of any provision of
this Voting Agreement or the Proxy may be brought or otherwise commenced in any
state or federal court located in the Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan area.
Stockholder:

                           (i)      expressly and irrevocably consents and
submits to the jurisdiction of each state and federal court located in the
Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan area (and each appellate court located in the
State of Massachusetts), in connection with any such legal proceeding;

                           (ii)     agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. mail addressed to him at the address set forth in
Section 8.5 shall constitute effective service of such process, summons, notice
or document for purposes of any such legal proceeding;

                           (iii)    agrees that each state and federal court
located in the Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan area on shall be deemed to be
a convenient forum; and

                           (iv)     agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise), in any such legal proceeding commenced in any state or
federal court located in the Boston, Massachusetts metropolitan area, any claim
that Stockholder is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that such legal proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the
venue of such proceeding is improper or that this Voting Agreement or the
subject matter of this Voting Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court.

                                       7
<PAGE>

affect the right of Parent to commence any legal proceeding or otherwise proceed
against Stockholder in any other forum or jurisdiction.

                  (c)      STOCKHOLDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY
TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS VOTING AGREEMENT
OR THE PROXY OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS VOTING AGREEMENT OR THE
PROXY.

         8.12     COUNTERPARTS. This Voting Agreement may be executed by the
parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one
and the same instrument.

         8.13     CAPTIONS. The captions contained in this Voting Agreement are
for convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Voting Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the
construction or interpretation of this Voting Agreement.

         8.14     ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action or other legal proceeding
relating to this Voting Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this
Voting Agreement is brought against Stockholder, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in
addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

         8.15     WAIVER. No failure on the part of Parent to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Voting Agreement, and no delay on
the part of Parent in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Voting Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege
or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. Parent shall not be deemed to have waived any
claim available to Parent arising out of this Voting Agreement, or any power,
right, privilege or remedy of Parent under this Voting Agreement, unless the
waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth
in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of Parent; and any
such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific
instance in which it is given.

         8.16    CONSTRUCTION.

the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall
not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Voting Agreement.

Voting Agreement to "Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections

contrary, this Voting Agreement shall not be construed to allow the holder of
the Proxy to effectuate the Merger contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement

                                IRREVOCABLE PROXY



         The undersigned stockholder of CO SPACE, INC., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest extent permitted by law)
appoints and constitutes PAUL E. MCBRIDE, THOMAS YOUTH and INTERNAP NETWORK
SERVICES CORPORATION, a Washington corporation ("Parent"), and each of them, the
attorneys and proxies of the undersigned with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to the full extent of the undersigned's rights with respect to
(i) the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company owned of record by
the undersigned as of the date of this proxy, which shares are specified on the
final page of this proxy, and (ii) any and all other shares of capital stock of
the Company which the undersigned may acquire on or after the date hereof. (The
shares of the capital stock of the Company referred to in clauses "(i)" and
"(ii)" of the immediately preceding sentence are collectively referred to as the
"Shares.") Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given by the undersigned
with respect to any of the Shares are hereby revoked, and the undersigned agrees
that no subsequent proxies will be given with respect to any of the Shares.

         This proxy is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest and is granted
in connection with the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between
Parent and the undersigned (the "Voting Agreement"), and is granted in
consideration of Parent entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, Cowboy Acquisition
Corp. and the Company (the "Reorganization Agreement").

         The attorneys and proxies named above will be empowered, and may
exercise this proxy, to vote the Shares at any time until the earlier to occur
of the valid termination of the Reorganization Agreement or the effective time
of the merger contemplated thereby (the "Merger") at any meeting of the
stockholders of the Company, however called, or in connection with any
solicitation of written consents from stockholders of the Company:

                           (i)      in favor of the adoption of the
Reorganization Agreement and the approval of the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth therein, and in favor of each of the other actions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement;

                           (ii)     against any action or agreement that to the
actual knowledge of Stockholder would result in a material breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company under the Reorganization Agreement; and

                           (iii)    against the following actions (other than
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement):
(A) any extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation or
other business combination involving the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company; (B) a sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
Company or any subsidiary of the Company or a reorganization, recapitalization,
dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company; or
(C) (1) any change in a majority of the board of directors of the Company; (2)
any amendment of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation; (3) any other
material change in the present

<PAGE>

capitalization of the Company or any amendment of the Company's corporate
structure; or (4) any other action which to the actual knowledge of
Stockholder is intended, or could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the contemplated
economic benefits to Parent of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement or this Voting Agreement.

         The undersigned may vote the Shares on all other matters.

         This proxy shall be binding upon the heirs, estate, executors, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned (including any
transferee of any of the Shares).

         Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, this Proxy
shall not be construed to allow any holder hereof to effectuate the Merger
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement absent acknowledgment of CO Space,
Inc. (including by delivery of the agreements and documents set forth in Section
6.7 of the Reorganization Agreement to Parent) that all conditions precedent set
forth in Section 7 of the Reorganization Agreement have been satisfied.

         If any provision of this proxy or any part of any such provision is
held under any circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
then (a) such provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such
circumstances and in such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to
applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible
extent, (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof
under such circumstances and in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision or part thereof under any other
circumstances or in any other jurisdiction, and (c) the invalidity or
unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this proxy. Each provision of this
proxy is separable from every other provision of this proxy, and each part of
each provision of this proxy is separable from every other part of such
provision.

<PAGE>

         This proxy shall terminate upon the earlier of the valid termination of
the Reorganization Agreement or the effective time of the Merger.

the Company which the undersigned may acquire on or after the date hereof. (The
shares of the capital stock of the Company referred to in clauses "(i)" and

with respect to any of the Shares are hereby revoked, and the undersigned agrees
that no subsequent proxies will be given with respect to any of the Shares.

         This proxy is irrevocable, is coupled with an interest and is granted
in connection with the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between
Parent and the undersigned (the "Voting Agreement"), and is granted in
consideration of Parent entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and

solicitation of written consents from stockholders of the Company:

                           (iii)    in favor of the adoption of the
Reorganization Agreement and the approval of the Merger, and in favor of each of
the other actions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement;

                           (iv)     against any action or agreement that to the
actual knowledge of Stockholder would result in a material breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company under the Reorganization Agreement; and

                           (iii)    against the following actions (other than

other business combination involving the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company; (B) a sale, lease or transfer of a material amount of assets of the

any amendment of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation; (3) any other
material change in the present capitalization of the Company or any amendment of
the Company's corporate structure; or (4) any other action which to the actual
knowledge of Stockholder is intended, or could reasonably

<PAGE>

be expected to impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage or
adversely affect the contemplated economic benefits to Parent of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement
or this Voting Agreement.

         The undersigned may vote the Shares on all other matters.

         This proxy shall be binding upon the heirs, estate, executors, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned (including any
transferee of any of the Shares).

         Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the contrary, this Proxy
shall not be construed to allow any holder hereof to effectuate the Merger
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement absent acknowledgment of CO Space,
Inc. (including by delivery of the agreements and documents set forth in Section
6.7 of the Reorganization Agreement to Parent) that all conditions precedent set
forth in Section 7 of the Reorganization Agreement have been satisfied.

         If any provision of this proxy or any part of any such provision is
held under any circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
then (a) such provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such
circumstances and in such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to
applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible
extent, (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof
under such circumstances and in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision or part thereof under any other
circumstances or in any other jurisdiction, and (c) the invalidity or
unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the validity or
enforceability of any other provision of this proxy. Each provision of this
proxy is separable from every other provision of this proxy, and each part of
each provision of this proxy is separable from every other part of such
provision.

         This proxy shall terminate upon the earlier of the valid termination of
the Reorganization Agreement or the effective time of the Merger.

Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Registration Statement to remain effective until the
earlier of (i) the date on which all Registerable Shares covered by the
Registration Statement have been sold to the public pursuant to the Registration
Statement or (ii) one year after the Closing Date, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the

hereof, Parent shall notify the Stockholders in writing at least thirty (30)
days prior to the filing of any registration statement under the Securities Act

Stockholder. The number of Registerable Shares that may be included in such
registration statement by a Stockholder shall equal a percentage of such
Stockholder's Registerable Shares equal to the percentage of Registerable
Securities (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) (or the applicable
percentage with respect to any other registration rights granted by Parent to
the Investors with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock owned by the
Investors as of the date hereof) held by the Investors that is proposed to be
sold by the Investors under such registration statement. Each Stockholder
desiring to include in any such registration statement any part of the
Registerable Shares held by it shall, within fifteen (15) days after the
above-described notice from the Parent, so notify the Parent in writing. Such
notice shall state the intended method of disposition of the Registerable Shares
by such Stockholder. If the registration statement under which the Parent gives
notice under this Section 2.2(b) is for an underwritten offering, the Parent
shall so advise the Stockholders. In such event, the right of any such
Stockholder to be included in a registration pursuant to this Section 2.2(b)
shall be conditioned upon such Stockholder's participation in such underwriting
and the inclusion of such Stockholder's Registerable Shares in the underwriting

Investor Rights Agreement, or any other agreement under which registration
rights are granted by Parent to the Investors with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock owned by the Investors as of the date hereof, has granted

Registerable Shares through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for
such underwriting by the Parent.

         2.3      EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION. Except as specifically provided
herein, all Registration Expenses incurred in connection with any registration,
qualification or compliance pursuant to Section 2.2 herein shall be borne by
Parent.

         2.4      OBLIGATIONS OF PARENT. Whenever required to effect the
registration of the Registerable Shares pursuant to Section 2.2, Parent shall,
as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

                  (a)      Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection
with such registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the
provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such registration statement for the Registration Effective
Period.

                  (b)      Furnish to the Stockholders such number of copies of
a prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act, and such other documents as they may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of Registerable Shares
owned by them.

                  (c)      Use all reasonable efforts to register and qualify
the securities covered by such registration statement under such other
securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably
requested by the Stockholders; PROVIDED that Parent shall not be required in
connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business or to
file a general consent to service of process in any such states or
jurisdictions.

                  (d)      Notify each Stockholder covered by such registration
statement at any time when a prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of
which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made. Thereafter, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
prepare and file with the SEC and furnish to each Stockholder as promptly as
practicable a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of
such prospectus or other such documents as may be necessary so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registerable Shares, such
prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which
such statements were made.

                  (e)      Use its best efforts to furnish, on the date that
such Registerable Shares are delivered to the underwriters for sale, if such
securities are being sold through underwriters, (i) an opinion, dated as of such
date, of the counsel representing Parent for the purposes of such registration,
in form and substance as is customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten
public offering, addressed to the underwriters, if any, and (ii) a letter dated
as of such date, from the independent certified public accountants of Parent, in
form and substance as is customarily given by independent certified public
accountants to underwriters in an underwritten public offering addressed to the
underwriters.

                                       4.
<PAGE>

         2.5     DELAY OF REGISTRATION; FURNISHING INFORMATION.

                  (a)      No Stockholder shall have any right to obtain or seek
an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as the
result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the interpretation or
implementation of this Section 2.

                  (b)      It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations
of Parent to take any action pursuant to Section 2.2 that the Stockholders shall
furnish to Parent such information regarding themselves, the Registerable Shares
held by them and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall
be required to effect the registration of their Registerable Shares.

         2.6      INDEMNIFICATION. In the event any Registerable Shares are
included in a registration statement under Section 2.2:

                  (a)      To the extent permitted by law, Parent will indemnify
and hold harmless each Stockholder, the partners, officers and directors of each
Stockholder, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such
Stockholder and each person, if any, who controls such Stockholder or
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to which
they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other
federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following
statements, omissions or violations (collectively a "Violation") by Parent: (i)
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
such registration statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final
prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (ii) the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(iii) any violation or alleged violation by Parent of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, any state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law in
connection with the offering covered by such registration statement; and Parent
will pay as incurred to each such Stockholder, partner, officer, director,
underwriter or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action; PROVIDED HOWEVER, that the indemnity
agreement contained in this Section 2.6(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, nor shall Parent be liable in any such case for any such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that it arises out of or
is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such
registration by such Stockholder, partner, officer, director, underwriter or
controlling person of such Stockholder.

                  (b)      To the extent permitted by law, each Stockholder will
indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each of its directors, its officers and each
person, if any, who controls Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act,
any underwriter and any other Stockholder

                                       5.

selling securities under such registration statement or any of such other
Stockholder's partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such
Stockholder, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or
several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereto) arise out of or are
based upon any Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent)
that such Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished by such Stockholder under an instrument duly executed
by such Stockholder and stated to be specifically for use in connection with
such registration; and each such Stockholder will pay as incurred any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by Parent or any such director,
officer, controlling person, underwriter or other Stockholder, or partner,
officer, director or controlling person of such other Stockholder in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action if it is judicially determined in a final, non-appealable
decision that there was such a Violation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
indemnity agreement contained in this Section 2.6(b) shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Stockholder,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; PROVIDED FURTHER, that in
no event shall any indemnity under this Section 2.6 exceed the net proceeds
from the offering received by such Stockholder.

                  (c)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under
this Section 2.6 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any
governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof
is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 2.6, deliver to
the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if
representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the
indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such
counsel in such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such
action, if materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall
relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under
this Section 2.6, but the omission so to deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 2.6.

                  (d)      If the indemnification provided for in this Section
2.6 is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an
indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
referred to herein, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party thereunder, shall to the extent permitted by applicable law
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of the
indemnified party on the other in connection with

                                       6.
<PAGE>

the Violation(s) that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by a
court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by
the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission;
PROVIDED, that in no event shall any contribution by a Stockholder hereunder
exceed the net proceeds from the offering received by such Stockholder.

                  (e)      The obligations of Parent and Stockholders under this
Section 2.6 shall survive completion of any offering of Registerable Shares in a
registration statement and the termination of this agreement. No Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from
all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

         2.7      RULE 144 REPORTING. With a view to making available to the
Stockholders the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may
permit the sale of the Registerable Shares to the public without registration,
Parent agrees to:

                  (a)      Make and keep public information available, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule
promulgated under the Securities Act;

                  (b)      File with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports
and other documents required of Parent under the Exchange Act; and

                  (c)      So long as a Stockholder owns any Registerable
Shares, furnish to such Stockholder forthwith upon request: a written statement
by Parent as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said Rule 144
of the Securities Act and of the Exchange Act; a copy of the most recent annual
or quarterly report of Parent; and such other reports and documents as a
Stockholder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation
of the SEC allowing it to sell any such securities without registration.

         2.8      CESSATION OF OFFERING. Upon receipt of any notice from Parent
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.4(d), the
disposition of the Registerable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement
covering such shares shall be immediately discontinued until the Stockholders
receive copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus or other documents
contemplated by Section 2.4(d), and, if so directed by Parent, the Stockholders
shall deliver to Parent all copies of the prospectus covering such Registerable
Shares in such Stockholder's possession at the time of receipt of such notice.
In no event may Parent cause the cessation of the sale of shares under the
Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.4(d) for more than an aggregate of
45 days during the Registration Effective Period.

                                       7.

<PAGE>



                                ESCROW AGREEMENT


         THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of June
_____, 2000, by and among: INTERNAP NETWORK SERVICES CORPORATION, a Washington
corporation ("Parent"), the stockholders of CO SPACE, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), identified on EXHIBIT A hereto (the "Merger
Stockholders"), CO SPACE STOCKHOLDERS' AGENT LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, as Stockholders' Agent ("Stockholders' Agent"), and STATE STREET BANK
AND TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA, N.A., a national banking association (the
"Escrow Agent").

                                  RECITALS

         A.       Parent, Cowboy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company have entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of May 26,
2000, as amended (the "Reorganization Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company and the Merger Stockholders will have the
right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock (the "Merger").

         B.       The Reorganization Agreement contemplates the establishment of
an escrow arrangement to secure the indemnification and other obligations of the
Merger Stockholders under the Reorganization Agreement.

         C.       Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Reorganization Agreement and
Section 10 of this Agreement, the Merger Stockholders have irrevocably appointed
CO Space Stockholders' Agent LLC to serve as Stockholders' Agent for, among
other things, all matters set forth in Section 9 of the Reorganization Agreement
and the expense reimbursement provisions of Section 10.3 of the Reorganization
Agreement.

                                  AGREEMENT

         The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

         1.       DEFINED TERMS. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and
not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the
Reorganization Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto.

         2.       ESCROW AND INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a)      SHARES PLACED IN ESCROW. At or as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, which shall be set forth in a written notice by Parent
to the Escrow Agent, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, on behalf and in
the name of each Merger Stockholder, a certificate for the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be held in escrow in accordance with the Reorganization
Agreement and this Agreement. The shares of Parent Common Stock being held in
escrow pursuant to this Agreement (the "Escrow Shares") shall constitute an
escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") with respect to the indemnification obligations
of the Merger Stockholders

                                     -1-

<PAGE>



under the Reorganization Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust
fund for the benefit of the Merger Stockholders and shall not be subject to
any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any Merger Stockholder or of any party hereto. The Escrow Agent
agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow Shares and to hold the Escrow Fund in
an escrow account (the "Escrow Account"), subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

                  (b)      VOTING OF ESCROW SHARES. The Merger Stockholders of
the Escrow Shares shall be entitled to exercise all voting rights with respect
to such Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for the
genuineness, validity, market value, title or sufficiency for any intended
purpose of the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent shall be under no obligation to
preserve, protect or exercise rights in the Escrow Shares, and shall be
responsible only for reasonable measures to maintain the physical safekeeping
thereof, and otherwise to perform and observe such duties on its part as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement; except that it shall, at the written
request of the Stockholders' Agent given to the Escrow Agent at least three (3)
business days prior to the date on which the Escrow Agent is requested therein
to take any action, deliver to the Stockholders' Agent a proxy or other
instrument in the form supplied to it by the Stockholders' Agent for voting or
otherwise exercising any right of consent with respect to any of the Escrow
Shares held by it hereunder, authorizing the Stockholders' Agent to exercise
such voting or consent authority in respect of the Escrow Shares. The Escrow
Agent shall not be responsible for forwarding to any party, notifying any party
with respect to, or taking any action with respect to, any notice, solicitation
or other document or information, written or otherwise, received from the issuer
or other person with respect to the Escrow Shares, including but not limited to,
proxy material, tenders, options, the pendency of calls and maturities and
expiration of rights.

                  (c)      DIVIDENDS, ETC. Parent and each of the Merger
Stockholders agree among themselves, for the benefit of Parent and the Escrow
Agent, that any securities or other property distributable (whether by way of
dividend, stock split or otherwise) in respect of or in exchange for any Escrow
Shares shall not be distributed to the record owners of such Escrow Shares, but
rather shall be distributed to and held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow
Account. Ordinary cash dividends will be paid by Parent directly to the Merger
Stockholders and not to the Escrow Agent. Unless and until the Escrow Agent
shall actually receive such additional securities or other property, it may
assume without inquiry that the Escrow Shares currently being held by it in the
Escrow Account are all that the Escrow Agent is required to hold. At the time
any Escrow Shares are required to be released from the Escrow Account to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement, any securities or other property previously
received by the Escrow Agent in respect of or in exchange for such Escrow Shares
shall be released from the Escrow to such Person.

                  (d)      TRANSFERABILITY. The interests of the Merger
Stockholders in the Escrow Account and in the Escrow Shares shall not be
transferable unless the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms
and conditions of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no case may a
Merger Stockholder transfer its interests in the Escrow Account and in the
Escrow Shares to more than three transferees. No transfer of any of such
interests by operation of law shall be recognized or given effect until Parent
and the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of such transfer.

                                     -2-

<PAGE>


                  (e)      FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be retained in or released from the Escrow Account pursuant
to this Agreement. In connection with any release of Escrow Shares from the
Escrow Account, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall "round down" in order to avoid
retaining any fractional share in the Escrow Account and in order to avoid
releasing any fractional share from the Escrow Account. When shares are "rounded
down," no cash-in-lieu payments need to be made.

         3.       ADMINISTRATION OF ESCROW ACCOUNT. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Escrow Agent shall administer the Escrow Account as follows:

                  (a)      If any Indemnitee has or, reasonably and in good
faith, claims to have incurred or suffered Damages for which it is or may be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9.2 or
Section 10.3 of the Reorganization Agreement, such Indemnitee may, on or prior
to the first anniversary of the Effective Date of the Merger (the "First
Anniversary"), deliver a claim notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Stockholders'
Agent and to the Escrow Agent. Each Claim Notice shall state that such
Indemnitee believes in good faith that there is or has been a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant contained in the Reorganization Agreement
(specifying such representation, warranty or covenant contained in the
Reorganization Agreement believed to have been breached and specifying the
Transaction Costs for which it believes it is so entitled to reimbursement) or
that such Indemnitee is otherwise entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 9.2 or Section 10.3 of the Reorganization Agreement
and contain a brief description in reasonable detail of the facts and
circumstances supporting such Indemnitee's belief that there is or has been such
a breach or that such Indemnitee is so entitled to indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement and shall, to the extent possible, contain a non-binding,
preliminary estimate of the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have so
incurred or suffered (the "Claimed Amount").

                  (b)      Within 30 business days after receipt by the
Stockholders' Agent of a Claim Notice, the Stockholders' Agent may deliver to
the Indemnitee who delivered the Claim Notice and to the Escrow Agent a written
response (the "Response Notice") in which the Stockholders' Agent: (i) agrees
that a whole number of Escrow Shares having a "Stipulated Value" (as defined
below) equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account
to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value
equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") may be
released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee or (iii) indicates that no
part of the Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to the
Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not to be released to the
Indemnitee shall be the "Contested Amount." If a Response Notice is not received
by the Escrow Agent within such 30 business-day period, then the Stockholders'
Agent shall be deemed to have agreed that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated
Value equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released to the Indemnitee from
the Escrow Account.

                  (c)      If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice
agreeing that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to the full Claimed
Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee, or if the
Stockholders' Agent does not deliver a Response Notice in accordance with
Section 3(b), the Escrow Agent shall within five (5)

                                     -3-

<PAGE>

business days following the receipt of the Response Notice (or, if the Escrow
Agent has not received a Response Notice, within five (5) business days
following the expiration of the 30 business-day period referred to in Section
3(b)), deliver or cause to be delivered to such Indemnitee such Escrow
Shares. Such payment shall be deemed to be made in full satisfaction of the
claim described in such Claim Notice.

                  (d)      If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice
agreeing that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to the
Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall within five (5) business days following the
receipt of the Response Notice deliver or cause to be delivered to such
Indemnitee Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to the Agreed Amount.

                  (e)      If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice
and there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders' Agent and the Indemnitee
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested
Amount. If the Indemnitee and the Stockholders' Agent shall resolve such
dispute, such resolution shall be binding on all of the Merger Stockholders and
all of the Indemnitees and a settlement agreement shall be signed by the
Indemnitee and the Stockholders' Agent and sent to the Escrow Agent, who shall,
upon receipt thereof, if applicable, release Escrow Shares from the Escrow
Account in accordance with such agreement.

                  (f)      If the Stockholders' Agent and the Indemnitee are
unable to resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount within 45
business days after the delivery of the Claim Notice, then the claim described
in the Claim Notice shall be settled by binding arbitration in the Boston,
Massachusetts metropolitan area in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules").
Unless otherwise agreed, arbitration will be conducted by three arbitrators; one
selected by Parent, one selected by the Stockholders' Agent and the third
selected by the first two arbitrators. If Parent or the Stockholders' Agent
fails to select an arbitrator within ten business days after the expiration of
the 45-business day period referred to in the first sentence of this Section
3(f), then the other shall be entitled to select the second arbitrator. The
parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration
hearing to be conducted within 60 calendar days after the appointment of the
last of the three arbitrators and to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the arbitrators' decision to be furnished within 95 calendar days after
the appointment of the last of the three arbitrators. The arbitrators' decision
shall relate solely to whether the Indemnitee is entitled to recover the
Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of such Contested
Amount the Indemnitee is entitled to recover. The final decision of the
arbitrators shall be furnished to the Stockholders' Agent, the Indemnitee and
the Escrow Agent in writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of
the issue in question, binding upon the Merger Stockholders, the Indemnitee and
the Escrow Agent and shall not be contested by any of them. The non-prevailing
party in any arbitration shall pay the reasonable expenses (including attorneys'
fees) of the prevailing party, any additional reasonable fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees) of the Escrow Agent, and the fees and expenses
associated with the arbitration (including the arbitrators' fees and expenses).
For purposes of this Section 3(f), the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be the
non-prevailing party if the Indemnitee is entitled to recover less than 50% of
the Contested Amount; otherwise the Merger Stockholders shall be

                                     -4-

<PAGE>

deemed to be the non-prevailing party. Any amounts payable by the Merger
Stockholders shall be paid out of Escrow Shares, after payment of any amounts
then payable to Indemnitees, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a written
request of Parent and the Stockholders' Agent stating the amount of Escrow
Shares to be released.

                  (g)      The Escrow Agent shall release Escrow Shares from the
Escrow Account in connection with any Contested Amount within 5 business days
after the delivery to it of: (i) a copy of a settlement agreement executed by
the Indemnitee and the Stockholders' Agent setting forth instructions to the
Escrow Agent as to the number of Escrow Shares, if any, to be released from the
Escrow Account, with respect to such Contested Amount or (ii) a copy of the
award of the arbitrators referred to and as provided in Section 3(f) setting
forth instructions to the Escrow Agent as to the number of Escrow Shares, if
any, to be released from the Escrow Account, with respect to such Contested
Amount.

                  (h)      Any Escrow Shares released from the Escrow Account to
an Indemnitee shall be deemed to reduce the Escrow Shares pro rata with respect
to each Stockholder in accordance with each Stockholder's percentage interest in
the Escrow Fund as set forth in EXHIBIT B.

         4.       RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES.

                  (a)      FIRST RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES.

                           (i)      On the date that is 180 days after the
Effective Date of the Merger (the "First Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall
distribute or cause the stock transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock to
distribute to each Merger Stockholder at such Merger Stockholder's address set
forth on EXHIBIT B such Merger Stockholder's pro-rata portion of the First
Release Escrow Shares (as defined below) based on the percentage interests in
the Escrow Fund set forth in EXHIBIT B. "First Release Escrow Shares" shall mean
the difference between (A) fifty percent (50%) of the Escrow Shares, and (B)
those shares (1) released prior to the First Release Date pursuant to Section 3
hereof, (2) retained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 4(a)(ii) hereof, or
(3) distributed prior to the First Release Date pursuant to Section 10 hereof.

                           (ii)     If prior to the First Release Date, any
Indemnitee has given a Claim Notice containing a claim which has not been
resolved prior to the First Release Date in accordance with Section 3, the
Escrow Agent shall retain in the Escrow Account after the First Release Date,
Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to 100% of the Claimed Amount or
Contested Amount, as the case may be, with respect to all claims which have not
then been resolved. Such Claimed Amount or Contested Amount, as the case may be,
shall be retained by the Escrow Agent until such claim has been completely and
finally determined in accordance with Section 3 hereof.

                  (b)      SECOND RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES.

                           (i)      Within five business days after the First
Anniversary, the Escrow Agent shall distribute or cause the stock transfer agent
for the Parent Common Stock to distribute

                                     -5-

<PAGE>

to each Merger Stockholder at such Merger Stockholder's address set forth on
EXHIBIT B such Merger Stockholder's pro-rata portion of the remaining Escrow
Shares then held in escrow (excluding any shares retained pursuant to Section
4(a)(ii) or 4(b)(ii) hereof) based on the percentage interests in the Escrow
Fund set forth in EXHIBIT B.

                           (ii)     If prior to the First Anniversary, any
Indemnitee has given a Claim Notice containing a claim which has not been
resolved prior to the First Anniversary in accordance with Section 3, the Escrow
Agent shall retain in the Escrow Account after the First Anniversary, Escrow
Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to 100% of the Claimed Amount or
Contested Amount, as the case may be, with respect to all claims which have not
then been resolved. Such Claimed Amount or Contested Amount, as the case may be,
shall be retained by the Escrow Agent until such claim has been completely and
finally determined in accordance with Section 3 hereof.

                  (c)      The Escrow Agent is not the stock transfer agent for
the Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, if a distribution of a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock less than all of the Escrow Shares is to be made, the Escrow
Agent must requisition the appropriate number of shares from such stock transfer
agent, delivering to it the stock certificate representing the amount of Escrow
Shares then held in the Escrow Account and requesting that such stock transfer
agent deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate representing the Escrow Shares
that are not to be distributed at such time from the Escrow Account. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have delivered
Parent Common Stock to the Person entitled to it when the Escrow Agent has
delivered such certificates to such stock transfer agent with instructions to
deliver it to the appropriate Person. Distributions of Parent Common Stock shall
be made to Parent or the Merger Stockholders, as appropriate, at the addresses
described in Section 10(b). Whenever a distribution is to be made to the Merger
Stockholders, pro rata distributions shall be made to each of them based on the
percentage interests in the Escrow Fund and at their addresses set forth in
EXHIBIT B.

         5.       VALUATION OF ESCROW SHARES, ETC.

                  (a)      STIPULATED VALUE. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Stipulated Value" of each Escrow Share shall be deemed to be equal to $________
[PER SHARE VALUE AS OF CLOSING DATE]; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Stipulated
Value for any Escrow Share that is used to satisfy Damages incurred pursuant to
a Legal Proceeding or a third-party claim (whether or not a Legal Proceeding is
formally commenced) which was not commenced, threatened or made prior to the
date of the Reorganization Agreement, and for which Parent is entitled to
indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(iii) of the Reorganization Agreement, or
for payment to the Stockholders' Agent pursuant to Section 10 hereof, shall be
the average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as
reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the 30-day trading period preceding
the date upon which the Damages which Parent or the Company has suffered or
incurred in such Legal Proceeding or third-party claim has been determined and
becomes due and payable, or date on which the payment to the Stockholders' Agent
became due and payable, as certified in writing by Parent and delivered to the
Escrow Agent.

                  (b)      STOCK SPLITS. All numbers contained in, and all
calculations required to be made pursuant to, this Agreement shall be adjusted
as appropriate to reflect any stock split,

                                     -6-


<PAGE>

reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction effected by Parent
after the date hereof; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall have
received notice of such stock split or other action and shall have received
the appropriate number of additional shares of Parent Common Stock or other
property pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof. In the event of any such stock
split or other similar occurrence, Parent shall deliver to the Stockholders'
Agent and the Escrow Agent a revised version of EXHIBIT B setting forth the
new number of Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Fund. Unless and until the
Escrow Agent receives the certificates representing additional shares of
Parent Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 2(c), the Escrow
Agent may assume without inquiry that no such stock or other property has
been or is required to be issued with respect to Escrow Shares.

          (c) EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Reorganization Agreement or this Agreement, if anything, with the
exception of claims based upon willful fraud, from and after the Closing,
recourse of Parent to the Escrow Shares (adjusted as appropriate to reflect
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction
effected by Parent after the date hereof) pursuant to the Reorganization
Agreement and this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent
and the other Indemnitees for any claim for Damages under the indemnification
provisions contained in, or for any breach of, any provision of the
Reorganization Agreement.

    6.   FEES AND EXPENSES. Upon the execution of this Agreement by all
parties hereto and the initial deposit of the Escrow Fund in the Escrow
Account, fees and expenses, in accordance with EXHIBIT C attached hereto,
will be payable to the Escrow Agent. This annual Escrow Agent fee will cover
the twelve months of the escrow. In accordance with EXHIBIT C attached
hereto, the Escrow Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement for
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including those of its
counsel, incurred by the Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties
hereunder and the execution and delivery of this Agreement. All such fees and
expenses shall be paid by Parent.

    7.   LIMITATION OF ESCROW AGENT'S LIABILITY.

         (a)  The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement only, each of which are ministerial
in nature, and shall have no duty under, or obligation to determine
compliance with, any other agreement or document notwithstanding their being
referred to herein or attached hereto as an exhibit. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable except for the performance of such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not
be deemed to be a fiduciary and shall incur no liability with respect to any
action taken by it or for any inaction on its part in reliance upon any
notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed
by it to be genuine and duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction
except for its own willful misconduct or negligence. The Escrow Agent shall
be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or
content of any such document. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit
any items which may be due it hereunder. In all questions arising under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely on the advice of counsel, and for
anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Escrow Agent based
upon such advice the Escrow Agent shall not be liable

                                       -7-
<PAGE>

to anyone. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take any action
hereunder involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is made or
provided for in a manner reasonably satisfactory to it. In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for incidental, punitive or consequential damages
regardless of whether it shall be informed of the likelihood of such damages.

         (b)  Parent hereby agrees to indemnify the Escrow Agent, its
officers, directors, employees and agents for, and hold it harmless against,
any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with
its carrying out of its duties hereunder. This right of indemnification shall
survive the termination of this Agreement, and the resignation of the Escrow
Agent. The costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification
shall also be paid by Parent.

         (c)  The Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for following
the instructions herein contained or expressly provided for, or written
instructions given jointly by Parent and the Stockholders' Agent.

In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and
its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until
it shall be directed otherwise in writing by all of the other parties hereto
or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

    8.   TERMINATION. This Agreement shall terminate on the Termination Date
or, if earlier, upon the release by the Escrow Agent of the entire Escrow
Fund in accordance with this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Escrow
Agent has received from any Indemnitee a Claim Notice setting forth a claim
that has not been resolved by the Termination Date, then this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect until the claim has been resolved and the
Escrow Shares released in accordance with this Agreement.

    9.   SUCCESSOR ESCROW AGENT. In the event the Escrow Agent becomes
unavailable or unwilling to continue as escrow agent under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to this Agreement.
Such resignation shall take effect not less than 30 calendar days after it is
given to all parties hereto. Parent may appoint a successor Escrow Agent only
with the consent of the Merger Stockholders holding a majority of the shares
in the Escrow Fund (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). If the parties fail to agree on a successor Escrow Agent within
such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. The
successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an
instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor Escrow Agent shall,
without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers
and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow
Agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall act in accordance with written
instructions from Parent as to the transfer of the Escrow Fund to a successor
escrow agent.

    10.  STOCKHOLDERS' AGENT. By virtue of their approval of the Merger and
the Reorganization Agreement and their execution of this Agreement, the
Merger Stockholders shall have approved the indemnification and escrow terms
set forth in the Reorganization Agreement and this Agreement and shall have
agreed to irrevocably appoint such Person or Entity as a majority in interest
of the Merger Stockholders shall appoint prior to the Closing as
Stockholders' Agent, to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, cash or other property
from the Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand dispute resolution
pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders' Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The Stockholders' Agent shall not be
responsible for, and the Merger Stockholders by virtue of their approval of
the Merger and the Reorganization Agreement and their execution of this
Agreement shall be deemed to release the Stockholders' Agent from, any loss
suffered by, or liability of any kind to, the Merger Stockholders arising out
of any act done or omitted by the Stockholders' Agent in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholders' Agent's duties hereunder,
unless such act or omission involves willful fraud or other willful
misconduct by the Stockholders' Agent. By virtue of their approval of the
Merger and this Agreement, the Merger Stockholders hereby agree to pay (i)
the reasonable fees of the Stockholders' Agent relating to his services
performed in such capacity as set forth on EXHIBIT D hereto and (ii) all
reasonable costs and expenses, including those of any legal counsel or other
professional retained by the Stockholders' Agent, in connection with the
acceptance and administration of the Stockholders' Agent's duties hereunder,
in each case to the extent set forth in Section 10.1 of the Reorganization
Agreement. To the extent set forth in Section 10.1 of the Reorganization
Agreement, subject to the prior right of Parent to make claims for Damages,
the Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Fund,
prior to any distribution to the Merger Stockholders pursuant to Section 4
hereof, a number of Escrow Shares set forth in a certificate of the
Stockholders' Agent (and executed by Parent to acknowledge its agreement to
the distribution) delivered to the Escrow Agent at least two (2) business
days prior to the date on which a distribution is to be made to the Merger
Stockholders equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) any reasonable
fees, costs and expenses set forth in such certificate, including those of
any legal counsel or other professional retained by the Stockholders' Agent,
in connection with the acceptance and administration of the Stockholders'
Agent's duties hereunder, by (ii) the Stipulated Value. In addition, the
Stockholders' Agent shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Fund,
prior to any distribution to any individual Merger Stockholder pursuant to
Section 4 hereof, a number of Escrow Shares set forth in a certificate of the
Stockholders' Agent delivered to the Escrow Agent at least two (2) business
days prior to the date on which a distribution is to be made to such Merger
Stockholder equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the amount of any
Additional Capital Contribution such Merger Stockholder has failed to make to
the Stockholders' Agent under and in accordance with the Limited Liability
Company Operating Agreement for CO Space Stockholders' Agent LLC (the "LLC
Agreement") as set forth in such certificate, by (ii) the Stipulated Value;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the Stockholders' Agent recover
more Escrow Shares than the number of Escrow Shares which such Merger
Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive in such distribution.

purposes, all interest on or other income, if any, attributable to the Escrow

to the Internal Revenue Service a portion of any interest or other income
earned on the investment of monies or other property held by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to this Agreement.

              (iii) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and
"including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

<PAGE>

                        STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATION LETTER

    THIS STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATION LETTER ("Letter") is being executed and
delivered as of June ____, 2000 by the undersigned stockholder of CO SPACE,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), to and in favor of, and for the
benefit of INTERNAP NETWORK SERVICES CORPORATION, a Washington corporation
("Parent"), and its affiliates.

                                    RECITALS

    A.   The undersigned stockholder of the Company (the "Stockholder")
represents to Parent that the Stockholder owns the number of shares of the
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and preferred stock, $0.01 par value
per share, of the Company set forth below the Stockholder's signature at the
end of this Letter. Said shares are referred to in this Letter as the

    B.   Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization,
dated as of May 26, 2000, as amended (the "Reorganization Agreement"), by and
among Parent, Cowboy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company, it is
contemplated that Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company being referred to in this Letter as

the consummation of the Merger, the Company's stockholders are to receive
shares of common stock of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") in exchange for
their shares of capital stock of the Company, any outstanding options or
warrants to purchase common stock or preferred stock of the Company are to be

    C.   Capitalized terms used in this Letter have the meaning ascribed to
them in the Reorganization Agreement unless otherwise stated herein.

                                  CERTIFICATION

    1.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE STOCKHOLDER. The Stockholder
represents, warrants and certifies to Parent as follows:

         (a)  The Stockholder is the holder and beneficial owner of the
Shares and has good and valid title to the Shares, free and clear of any
Encumbrances. The Shares are the only shares of the capital stock of the
Company held by the Stockholder. The Stockholder has the ability to vote all
of the Shares at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company or by written
consent in lieu of any such meeting. Except pursuant to the Reorganization
Agreement, the Voting Agreement, dated _____ ___, 2000, by and between Parent
and Stockholder and the other agreements specifically identified in the
Disclosure Schedule, the Stockholder has not appointed or granted any proxy
or entered into any agreement, contract, commitment or understanding with
respect to any of the Shares that is now in force.

                                       1.
<PAGE>

         (b)  The Stockholder has the absolute and unrestricted right, power,
authority and capacity to enter into, execute, deliver and perform all of
Stockholder's obligations under each agreement, document or instrument
referred to in or contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement to which the
Stockholder is or is to become a party.

         (c)  Each agreement, document or instrument referred to in or
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement to which the Stockholder is or
is to become a party (i) has been (or will when executed by the Stockholder
be) duly and validly executed by the Stockholder and (ii) constitutes (or
will when executed by the Stockholder constitute) a valid and binding
obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and to rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

         (d)  Neither the execution, delivery or performance by the
Stockholder of any agreement, document or instrument referred to in or
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement to which the Stockholder is or
is to become a party, nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement, will directly or
indirectly: (i) result in any violation or breach of any agreement or other
instrument to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder is
bound or (ii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree to which the Stockholder or any of the Shares is subject.
No authorization, consent or approval of, or notice to, any Person is
required to be obtained or given by the Stockholder in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of any agreement, document or instrument
referred to in or contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement to which the
Stockholder is or is to become a party.

         (e)  There is no Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body
pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the
Stockholder that challenges or would challenge the execution and delivery of
any agreement, document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by the
Reorganization Agreement to which the Stockholder is or is to become a party
or the taking of any of the actions required to be taken by the Stockholder
under any agreement, document or instrument referred to in or contemplated by
the Reorganization Agreement to which the Stockholder is or is to become a
party.

         (f)  The Stockholder is aware (i) that the Parent Common Stock to be
issued to the Stockholder in the Merger will not be issued pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act"), but will instead be issued in reliance on the exemption from
registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Act and in Regulation D under
the Act and (ii) that neither the Merger nor the issuance of such Parent
Common Stock has been approved or reviewed by the SEC or by any other
Governmental Body.

         (g)  The Stockholder is aware that the Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger cannot be resold unless such Parent Common Stock is
registered under the Act or unless an exemption from registration is
available. The Stockholder is also aware that: (i) except pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement, Parent is
under no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to the
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Stockholder in the Merger; and (ii)
the provisions of Rule 144 under the Act will

                                       2.
<PAGE>

permit resale of the Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Stockholder in
the Merger only under limited circumstances.

         (h)  The Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Stockholder in the
Merger will be acquired by the Stockholder for investment and for
Stockholder's own account, and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any unregistered distribution thereof.

         (i)  The Stockholder has received and examined Parent's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, Parent's Final
Prospectus dated April 6, 2000, the Proxy Statement for Parent's 2000 Annual
Meeting and the Information Statement, including the risk factors described
therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholder
specifically acknowledges that the stock price of Parent Common Stock has
been, and will likely continue to be, extremely volatile.

         (j)  The Stockholder has been given the opportunity: (i) to ask
questions of, and to receive answers from, persons acting on behalf of the
Company and Parent concerning the terms and conditions of the Merger and the
contemplated issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the business,
properties, prospects and financial condition of the Company and Parent; and
(ii) to obtain any additional information (to the extent the Company or
Parent possesses such information or is able to acquire it without
unreasonable effort or expense and without breach of confidentiality
obligations) that is necessary to verify the accuracy of the information set
forth in the documents, provided or made available to the Stockholder.

         (k)  The  Stockholder is an "accredited  investor" (as such term is
defined in Rule 501 under the Act).

                       Yes ____         No ____

If "No" is checked, the Stockholder, either alone or with the Stockholder's
designated purchaser representative, has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that the Stockholder is capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of the Stockholder's contemplated investment in the
Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

         (l)  The Stockholder understands that stop transfer instructions
will be given to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common
Stock to be issued to the Stockholder in the Merger, and that there will be
placed on the certificate or certificates representing such Parent Common
Stock a legend identical or similar in effect to the following legend
(together with any other legend or legends required by applicable state
securities laws or otherwise):

                  "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
    REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE
    OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR
    HYPOTHECATED UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION
    FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

    2.   RELIANCE. The Stockholder acknowledges that Parent will rely on
Stockholder's

                                       3.
<PAGE>

representations, warranties and certifications set forth in Section 1 above
for purposes of determining Stockholder's suitability as an investor in
Parent Common Stock and for purposes of confirming the availability of an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Act.

    3.   PROHIBITIONS AGAINST TRANSFER. The Stockholder shall not effect any
sale, transfer or other disposition of any of the Parent Common Stock that
the Stockholder is to receive in the Merger unless:

         (a)  such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered
under the Act;

         (b)  such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity
with the requirements of Rule 144 under the Act, as evidenced by a broker's
letter and a representation letter executed by the Stockholder (reasonably
satisfactory in form and content to Parent) stating that such requirements
have been met;

         (c)  counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall have advised
Parent in a written opinion letter (reasonably satisfactory in form and
content to Parent), upon which Parent may rely, that such sale, transfer or
other disposition will be exempt from registration under the Act; or

         (d)  an authorized representative of the SEC shall have rendered
written advice to the Stockholder to the effect that the SEC would take no
action, or that the staff of the SEC would not recommend that the SEC take
action, with respect to such sale, transfer or other disposition, and a copy
of such written advice and all other related communications with the SEC
shall have been delivered to Parent.

    4.   STATEMENT OF NON-FOREIGN STATUS. To avoid tax withholding by Parent
in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger in
exchange for the stock of the Company, the Stockholder hereby certifies as
follows:

         (a)  the Stockholder is not a foreign person (as that term is
defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations);

         (b)  the Stockholder's U.S. taxpayer identification number is
______________; and

         (c)  the Stockholder's address is __________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

    The Stockholder understands that this certification may be disclosed to
the Internal Revenue Service by Parent and that any false statement contained
herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both. Under penalties of
perjury, the Stockholder declares that it, he or she has examined this
certification and to the best of its, his or her knowledge and belief it is
true, correct and complete, and the Stockholder further declares that the
Stockholder has authority to sign this document.

                                       4.

                                    EXHIBIT A

501(h)   PURCHASER REPRESENTATIVE. "Purchaser representative" shall mean any
person who satisfies all of the following conditions or who the issuer
reasonably believes satisfies all of the following conditions:

    (1)  Is not an affiliate, director, officer or other employee of the
issuer, or beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of any class of the equity
securities or 10 percent or more of the equity interest in the issuer, except
where the purchaser is:

         (i)   A relative of the purchaser representative by blood, marriage
or adoption and not more remote than a first cousin;

         (ii)  A trust or estate in which the purchaser representative and
any persons related to him as specified in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(iii)
of this rule collectively have more than 50 percent of the beneficial
interest (excluding contingent interest) or of which the purchaser
representative serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity; or

         (iii) A corporation or other organization of which the purchaser
representative and any persons related to him as specified in paragraph
(h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this rule collectively are the beneficial owners
of more than 50 percent of the equity securities (excluding directors'
qualifying shares) or equity interests;

    (2)  Has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
that he is capable of evaluating, alone, or together with other purchaser
representatives of the purchaser, or together with the purchaser, the merits
and risks of the prospective investment;

    (3)  Is acknowledged by the purchaser in writing, during the course of
the transaction, to be his purchaser representative in connection with
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment; and

    (4)  Discloses to the purchaser in writing a reasonable time prior to the
sale of securities to that purchaser any material relationship between
himself or his affiliates and the issuer or its affiliates that then exists,
that is mutually understood to be contemplated, or that has existed at any
time during the previous two years, and any compensation received or to be
received as a result of such relationship.

         NOTES. 1. A person acting as a purchaser representative should
   consider the applicability of the registration and antifraud provisions
   relating to brokers and dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
   ("Exchange Act"), as amended, and relating to investment advisers under the
   Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

                2. The acknowledgment required by paragraph (h)(3) and the
   disclosure required by paragraph (h)(4) of this rule must be made with
   specific reference to each prospective investment. Advance blanket
   acknowledgment, such as for "all securities transactions" or "all private
   placements," is not sufficient.

                3. Disclosure of any material relationships between the
    purchaser representative or his affiliates and the issuer or its affiliates
    does not relieve the purchaser representative of his obligation to act in
    the interest of the purchaser.

                                       1.

Dear CO Space Stockholder:

         I have been asked to serve as your Purchaser Representative in
connection with the proposed acquisition of CO Space, Inc. ("CO Space") by
InterNAP Network Services Corporation ("InterNAP"). In the acquisition, which
is structured as a merger (the "Merger"), the shares of common stock that you
now hold will be converted into shares of InterNAP common stock, unless you
decide to exercise your appraisal rights under Delaware law. The effects of,
and the procedure for, exercising your appraisal rights are described in the
Private Placement Memorandum/Information Statement dated June ___, 2000 that
you have received in connection with the Merger.

         If you execute this document, I will be available to advise you
concerning the merits and risks of the Merger. InterNAP and CO Space are
relying on my service on your behalf as your Purchaser Representative in
determining that the acquisition can be effected in compliance with
applicable securities laws.

         There is no material relationship between me or any of my affiliates
and InterNAP or its affiliates now existing, that is mutually understood to
be contemplated, or existing within the past two years other than in
connection with the Merger. I will be receiving no compensation for acting as
your Purchaser Representative.

         I agree to notify you as soon as practicable of any changes in the
information contained in this letter which may occur prior to the completion
of the Merger, which is expected to occur on or about June 30, 2000.

         By executing this letter, you hereby acknowledge that I will act as

                                    EXHIBIT A


                      INTERNAP NETWORK SERVICES CORPORATION

                       EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

         In consideration of my hire and continued employment by InterNAP
Network Services Corporation ("InterNAP"), the continued compensation of me by
InterNAP during my employment, and the disclosure to me of InterNAP's
confidential and proprietary information, I agree to the following terms and
conditions effective as of the commencement of my employment with InterNAP or
its affiliates.

         1.       CONFIDENTIALITY AND NONDISCLOSURE. I agree that information
not generally known to the public to which I will be exposed as a result of my
being employed by InterNAP is confidential information that belongs to InterNAP.
This includes information developed by me, alone or with others, or entrusted to
InterNAP by its customers or others. InterNAP's confidential information
includes, without limitation, information relating to InterNAP's trade secrets,
research and development, inventions, know-how, software, procedures,
accounting, marketing, sales, creative and marketing strategies, employee
salaries and compensation, and the identities of customers and active prospects
to the extent not publicly disclosed (collectively, "Confidential Information").
I will hold InterNAP's Confidential Information in strict confidence, and not
disclose or use it except as authorized by InterNAP and for InterNAP's benefit.

         I further acknowledge and agree that in order to enable InterNAP to
perform services for its customers or clients, such customers or clients may
furnish to InterNAP certain Confidential Information, that the goodwill afforded
to InterNAP depends upon InterNAP and its employees preserving the
confidentiality of such information, and that such information shall be treated
as Confidential Information of InterNAP for all purposes under this Agreement.

         2.       INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. I acknowledge that the breach or threatened
breach of the above nondisclosure provisions would cause irreparable injury to
InterNAP that could not be adequately compensated by money damages. InterNAP may
obtain a restraining order and/or injunction prohibiting my breach or threatened
breach of the noncompetition and/or nondisclosure provisions, in addition to any
other legal or equitable remedies that may be available.

         3.       POSSESSION. I agree that upon request by InterNAP, and in any
event upon termination of employment for any reason, I shall turn over to
InterNAP all documents, notes, papers, data, files, office supplies or other
material or work product in my possession or under my control which was created
pursuant to, is connected with or derived from my services to InterNAP, or which
is related in any manner to InterNAP's business activities or research and
development efforts, whether or not such material is currently in my possession.

         4.       WAIVER OF BREACH. The waiver of any breach of any provision of
this Agreement or the failure to enforce any provision shall not be construed as
a waiver of any later breach by any party.

         5.       ENFORCEMENT AND SEVERABILITY. If any portion of this Agreement
becomes invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement shall be construed
as if the invalid or unenforceable portion was omitted. The nondisclosure
provisions shall be enforceable against me notwithstanding the existence of any
claim I may have against InterNAP.

         6.       GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by the
internal laws of the state of Washington without giving effect to provisions
related to choice of laws or conflict of laws. Venue and jurisdiction of any
lawsuit involving this Agreement or my employment shall exist exclusively in
state and federal courts in King County, Washington or the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, unless injunctive relief is sought by InterNAP, and in InterNAP's
judgment, may not be effective unless obtained in some other venue.

<PAGE>

         7.       ATTORNEYS' FEES. In any lawsuit arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or my employment, including without limitation arising from any
alleged tort or statutory violation, the prevailing party shall recover its
reasonable costs and attorneys' fees, including on appeal.

<PAGE>

         8.       GENERAL. This Agreement may be modified, supplemented and/or
amended only by a writing that both I and InterNAP sign. This Agreement, as it
may be so amended, is the complete and final expression of my agreement with
InterNAP on the subjects covered, and shall control over any other statement,
representation or agreement on these subjects.

         I have read this Agreement before signing it, and I acknowledge receipt
of a signed copy.

         The undersigned, G. GABRIEL COLE (the "Employee"), in connection with
the Merger (as defined below) pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement (as

         1.       EFFECTIVE DATE. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger
and Reorganization, dated as of May 26, 2000 (the "Reorganization Agreement"),
among the Company, Cowboy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), and CO Space, Inc., a Delaware

         3.       COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. The Employee agrees that the services
to be rendered by him to the Company are special and unique. During the period
commencing on the effective date of this Agreement and ending one (1) year after

capacity, the Employee shall not, as an owner, part-owner, partner, director,
officer, trustee, employee, agent, consultant, joint venturer, stockholder,
representative, sole proprietor, independent contractor or in any other

housing of mission critical equipment, for three or more customers in each
facility, in the telecommunications, data and Internet industries and the
provision of services related to the installation, operation and maintenance
of equipment located at such facilities (the "Business") of the Company or
any subsidiary. The foregoing shall not prohibit the Employee from owning
five percent (5%) or less of the outstanding equity securities of any
corporation whose equity securities are regularly traded on any national
stock exchange or recognized "over-the-counter" market, nor shall it prohibit
the Employee from owning any interest, whether as a creditor or stockholder,
in the Company or any subsidiary.

         4.       NONSOLICITATION. During the period commencing on the effective
date of this Agreement and ending one (1) year from the termination of
Employee's employment with the Company, the Employee shall not, as an owner,
part-owner, partner, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, consultant,
joint venturer, stockholder, sole representative, sole proprietor or independent

(a "Company Employee") the employment of a Company Employee by any company,
business organization or any other entity that develops, produces or
manufactures any products or provides services that compete with the Business of
the Company or any subsidiary.

         5.       NO OBLIGATION OF EMPLOYMENT. The Employee understands that his
obligations under this Agreement are independent of any employment relationship
between Employee and the Company and do not create or give rise to any
obligation on the part of the Company to maintain the Employee in its employ.
The Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee's employment by the Company
is on an "at-will" basis, and that no other arrangement with the Company,
including without limitation bonus arrangements, stock option or other incentive
arrangements, shall be construed to impose any minimum or fixed term of
employment.

         6.       ABSENCE OF CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS. The Employee understands
that the Company does not desire to acquire from him any trade secrets, know-how
or confidential business information that he or she may have acquired from
others, and employee agrees that he or she shall not disclose or use such
information in connection with his or her employment hereunder in violation of
his or her obligations to others. The Employee represents that he or she is not
bound by any agreement or any other existing or previous business relationship
which conflicts with or prevents the full performance of the Employee's duties
and obligations to the Company during the course of his or her employment by the
Company.

         7.       ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action or other legal proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement
is brought against the Employee, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

         8.       MISCELLANEOUS. Any waiver by the Company of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach hereof.

<PAGE>

If one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any
reason be held to be excessively broad as to scope, activity or subject
matter so as to be unenforceable at law, such provision(s) shall be construed
and reformed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting and reducing it (or
them), so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with the
applicable law as it shall then appear. The obligations of the Employee under
this Agreement shall survive the termination of the Employee's relationship
with the Company. The Employee agrees that any breach of this Agreement by
the Employee could cause irreparable damage to the Company. The Company shall
have, in addition to any and all remedies of law, the right to an injunction
or other equitable relief to prevent any violation of the Employee's
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This
Agreement represents the complete agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter contained herein, all prior agreements between the parties
with respect thereto being merged. The Employee recognizes and agrees that
the enforcement of this Agreement is necessary to ensure the preservation,
protection and continuity of the confidential business information, trade
secrets and goodwill of the Company.

to license for housing of mission critical equipment, for three or more
customers in each facility, in the telecommunications, data and Internet
industries and the provision of services related to the installation, operation
and maintenance of equipment located at such facilities (the "Business") of the
Company or any subsidiary. The foregoing shall not prohibit the Employee from
owning five percent (5%) or less of the outstanding equity securities of any
corporation whose equity securities are regularly traded on any national stock
exchange or recognized "over-the-counter" market, nor shall it prohibit the
Employee from owning any interest, whether as a creditor or stockholder, in the
Company or any subsidiary.

date of this Agreement and ending one (1) year from the termination of
Employee's employment with the Company, the Employee shall not, as an owner,

joint venturer, stockholder, sole representative, sole proprietor or independent
contractor, or in any other capacity (a) solicit, divert or take away existing
customers or business from the Business of the Company or any subsidiary, or (b)
solicit or discuss with any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries

manufactures any products or provides services that compete with the Business of
the Company or any subsidiary.

         5.       NO OBLIGATION OF EMPLOYMENT. The Employee understands that his
obligations under this Agreement are independent of any employment relationship
between Employee and the Company and do not create or give rise to any
obligation on the part of the Company to maintain the Employee in its employ.
The Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee's employment by the Company
is on an "at-will" basis, and that no other arrangement with the Company,
including without limitation bonus arrangements, stock option or other incentive
arrangements, shall be construed to impose any minimum or fixed term of
employment.

         6.       ABSENCE OF CONFLICTING AGREEMENTS. The Employee understands
that the Company does not desire to acquire from him any trade secrets, know-how
or confidential business information that he or she may have acquired from
others, and employee agrees that he or she shall not disclose or use such
information in connection with his or her employment hereunder in violation of
his or her obligations to others. The Employee represents that he or she is not
bound by any agreement or any other existing or previous business relationship
which conflicts with or prevents the full performance of the Employee's duties
and obligations to the Company during the course of his or her employment by the
Company.

         7.       ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action or other legal proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement
is brought against the Employee, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees,

                                       2.

costs and disbursements (in addition to any other relief to which the
prevailing party may be entitled).

         8.       MISCELLANEOUS. Any waiver by the Company of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach hereof. If one or more of the provisions contained in this
Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to scope,
activity or subject matter so as to be unenforceable at law, such provision(s)
shall be construed and reformed by the appropriate judicial body by limiting and
reducing it (or them), so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible
with the applicable law as it shall then appear. The obligations of the Employee
under this Agreement shall survive the termination of the Employee's
relationship with the Company. The Employee agrees that any breach of this
Agreement by the Employee could cause irreparable damage to the Company. The
Company shall have, in addition to any and all remedies of law, the right to an
injunction or other equitable relief to prevent any violation of the Employee's
obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This
Agreement represents the complete agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter contained herein, all prior agreements between the parties with
respect thereto being merged. The Employee recognizes and agrees that the
enforcement of this Agreement is necessary to ensure the preservation,
protection and continuity of the confidential business information, trade
secrets and goodwill of the Company.

RE:      MERGER PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND MERGER
         DATED AS OF MAY 26, 2000, AS AMENDED BY AMENDMENT NO. 1 THERETO DATED
         JUNE 12, 2000, (THE "REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT") AMONG INTERNAP NETWORK
         SERVICES CORPORATION, A WASHINGTON CORPORATION ("PARENT"), COWBOY
         ACQUISITION CORP., A DELAWARE CORPORATION ("MERGER SUB"), AND CO SPACE,
         INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (THE "COMPANY").

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter is supplied to you in connection with your rendering of opinions
regarding certain federal income tax consequences of the above-captioned merger
(the "Merger"). Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms not defined herein
have the meanings set forth in the Reorganization Agreement.

After consulting with their counsel and auditors regarding the meaning of and
factual support for the following representations, the undersigned hereby
certify and represent that the following facts are now true and will continue to
be true as of the Effective Time of the Merger and thereafter where relevant:

         1.       Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company, and the Company will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of
Merger Sub. Specifically, the assets transferred to the Company pursuant to the
Merger will represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of
the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of
the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. For the
purpose of determining the percentage of Merger Sub's net and gross assets held
by the Company immediately following the Merger, the following assets will be
treated as property held by Merger Sub immediately prior but not by the Company
subsequent to the Merger: (i) assets disposed of by Merger Sub (other than
assets transferred from Merger Sub to the Company in the Merger) prior to the
Merger and in contemplation thereof (including without limitation any asset
disposed of other than in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to a plan or
intent existing during the period ending at the Effective Time of the Merger and
beginning with the commencement of negotiations (whether formal or informal)
between Parent and the Company regarding the Merger (the "Pre-Merger Period"));
and (ii) assets used by Merger Sub to pay expenses or liabilities incurred in
connection with the Merger.


                                      1.
<PAGE>

         2.       In addition, at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market
value of the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market
value of the gross assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger
will continue to be held by the Company immediately after the Merger. For the
purpose of this paragraph 2, the following assets will be treated as property
held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger but not subsequent to the
Merger: (i) assets disposed of by the Company prior to or subsequent to the
Merger and in contemplation thereof (including without limitation any asset
disposed of by the Company, other than in the ordinary course of business),
pursuant to a plan or intent existing during the Pre-Merger Period; (ii) assets
used by the Company to pay Company stockholders perfecting dissenters' rights or
other expenses or liabilities incurred in connection with the Merger; (iii) cash
paid to Company stockholders in lieu of fractional shares; and (iv) assets used
to make distribution, redemption or other payments in respect of stock of the
Company or rights to acquire such stock (including payments treated as such for
tax purposes) that are made in contemplation of the Merger or that are related
thereto.

         3.       Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the
Merger and has conducted no business or activities except in connection with the
Merger. Merger Sub has no assets and no liabilities except as are necessarily
acquired or incurred pursuant to its incorporation. Merger Sub is directly owned
entirely by Parent.

         4.       The Merger will be consummated in accordance with the
Reorganization Agreement without waiver or modification by any party of any
material provision thereof.

         5.       Parent's principal reasons for participating in the Merger are
bona fide business purposes not related to taxes.

         6.       Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in "Control" of Merger
Sub. As used in this letter, "Control" shall consist of direct ownership of
shares of stock possessing at least eighty percent (80%) of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least eighty
percent (80%) of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the
corporation. For purposes of determining Control, a person shall not be
considered to own shares of voting stock if rights to vote such shares (or to
restrict or otherwise control the voting of such shares) are held by a third
party (including a voting trust) other than an agent of such person.

         7.       In the Merger, shares of Parent Common Stock will be exchanged
for shares of stock of the Company representing Control of the Company. For
purposes of this paragraph, shares of stock of the Company exchanged in the
Merger for cash and other property (including, without limitation, cash paid in
lieu of fractional shares, cash paid to stockholders of the Company perfecting
dissenters' rights, if any and cash paid pursuant to Section 1.5(f) of the
Reorganization Agreement (the "Escrow Cash")) will be treated as shares of stock
of the Company outstanding on the date of the Merger but not exchanged for
Parent Common Stock.

         8.       Parent Common Stock is voting stock. For purposes of this
paragraph, stock shall not be considered to be voting stock unless the voting
rights associated with the stock are equal to or superior to the voting rights
of all other classes of stock.


                                      2.
<PAGE>

         9.       Parent has no plan or intention to cause the Company to issue
additional shares of stock after the Merger, or take any other action, that
would result in Parent losing Control of the Company.

         10.      Except for transfers described in both Section 368(a)(2)(C) of
the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k)(2), Parent has no plan or
intention to: (a) liquidate the Company; (b) merge the Company with or into
another corporation including Parent or its affiliates; (c) sell, distribute or
otherwise dispose of the stock of the Company, or cause the Company to sell or
otherwise dispose of the stock of the Company; or (d) cause the Company to sell
or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or of any assets acquired from Merger
Sub, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or for
payment of expenses incurred by the Company pursuant to the Merger.

         11.      In the Merger, Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by
the Company and will not transfer to the Company any assets subject to
liabilities, except to the extent incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization Agreement.

         12.      Parent intends that, following the Merger, Parent or the
Company will continue the Company's historic business or use a significant
portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business.

         13.      During the past five (5) years, none of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company, including the right to acquire or vote any such
shares have, directly or indirectly, been owned by Parent or, to Parent's
knowledge, affiliates of Parent.

         14.      Parent is not an investment company within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

         15.      Parent has no plan or intention to reacquire any of its stock
issued in the Merger. Except for repurchases or redemptions of Parent Common
Stock that are (i) consistent with past practices and pursuant to pre-existing,
seasoned and systematic purchase programs that were not created or modified in
connection with the Merger; (ii) in connection with the termination of
employment in the ordinary course of business; or (iii) are returns of the
Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, neither Merger Sub nor Parent
nor any "related person" of Merger Sub or Parent (as such term is defined by
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) will repurchase or redeem any of the
Parent Common Stock to be issued to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger.

         16.      Except with respect to (i) payments of cash to shareholders of
the Company in lieu of fractional shares, (ii) payments of cash to stockholders
of the Company perfecting dissenters' rights and (iii) the Escrow Cash, one
hundred percent (100%) of the stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger will be exchanged solely for Parent Common Stock.

         17.      The total fair market value of all consideration other than
Parent Common Stock received by stockholders of the Company in the Merger
(including, without limitation, cash paid to shareholders of the Company in lieu
of fractional shares, cash paid to shareholders of the Company perfecting
dissenters' rights and the Escrow Cash) will be less than twenty percent


                                      3.
<PAGE>

(20%) of the aggregate fair market value of all stock of the Company
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger.

         18.      The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock received by
each stockholder of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of the stock of the Company surrendered in exchange therefor, and the sum
of the Merger Consideration plus the Escrow Cash received by stockholders of the
Company (or the Stockholders' Agent) in exchange for their stock of the Company
will be approximately equal to the fair market value of all of the outstanding
shares of stock of the Company immediately prior to the Merger.

         19.      Except as provided in Section 10.3 of the Reorganization
Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and each stockholder of
the Company will each pay separately his, her or its own expenses relating to
the Merger.

         20.      Except for amounts loaned by Parent to the Company pursuant to
the Credit Agreement, there is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between
Parent and the Company or between Merger Sub and the Company. No liabilities of
any person will be assumed by Parent or the Company in connection with the
Merger nor will any person transfer any assets subject to liabilities to Parent
or the Company as part of the Merger.

         21.      The terms of the Reorganization Agreement and the agreements
related thereto are the product of arm's length negotiations.

         22.      None of the compensation received by any stockholder-employee
of the Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their
shares of stock of the Company; none of the Parent Common Stock received by any
stockholder-employee of the Company will be separate consideration for, or
allocable to, any employment agreement or any covenants not to compete; and the
compensation paid to any stockholder-employee of the Company will be for
services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third
parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services.

         23.      The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. The fractional share interests of each Company
stockholder will be aggregated, and no Company stockholder will receive cash in
an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common
Stock.

         24.      With respect to each instance, if any, in which shares of
stock of the Company have been purchased during the Pre-Merger Period (a "Stock
Purchase"), to Parent's knowledge: (i) the Stock Purchase was not made by such
purchaser as a representative, or for the benefit, of Parent; (ii) the purchase
price paid by such purchaser pursuant to the Stock Purchase was not advanced,
and will not be reimbursed, either directly or indirectly, by Parent; (iii) at
no time was such purchaser or any other party required or obligated to surrender
to Parent the Company stock acquired in the Stock Purchase, and neither such
purchaser nor any other party will be required to surrender to Parent, the
Parent Common Stock for which such shares of stock of the Company will be
exchanged in the Merger; and (iv) the Stock Purchase was not a formal or
informal condition to consummation of the Merger.

RE:      MERGER PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION AND MERGER
         DATED AS OF MAY 26, 2000, AS AMENDED BY AMENDMENT NO. 1 THERETO DATED
         JUNE 12, 2000, (THE "REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT") AMONG INTERNAP NETWORK
         SERVICES CORPORATION, A WASHINGTON CORPORATION ("PARENT"), COWBOY
         ACQUISITION CORP., A DELAWARE CORPORATION ("MERGER SUB"), AND CO SPACE,
         INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (THE "COMPANY").

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter is supplied to you in connection with your rendering of opinions
regarding certain federal income tax consequences of the above-captioned merger
(the "Merger"). Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms not defined herein
have the meanings set forth in the Reorganization Agreement.

After consulting with its counsel and auditors regarding the meaning of and
factual support for the following representations, the undersigned hereby
certifies and represents that the following facts are now true and will continue
to be true as of the Effective Time of the Merger and thereafter where relevant:

         1.       Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into
the Company, and the Company will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of
Merger Sub. At least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the net
assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the gross
assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger will continue to be
held by the Company immediately after the Merger. For the purpose of this
paragraph 1, the following assets will be treated as property held by the
Company immediately prior but not subsequent to the Merger: (i) assets disposed
of by the Company prior to or subsequent to the Merger and in contemplation
thereof (including without limitation any asset disposed of by the Company,
other than in the ordinary course of business) pursuant to a plan or intent
existing during the period ending on the Effective Time of the Merger and
beginning with the commencement of negotiations (whether formal or informal)
with Parent regarding the Merger (the "Pre-Merger Period"); (ii) assets used by
the Company to pay Company stockholders perfecting dissenters' rights or other
expenses or liabilities incurred in connection with the Merger; (iii) cash paid
to Company stockholders in lieu of fractional shares; and (iv) assets used to
make distribution, redemption or other payments in respect of stock of the


                                       1.
<PAGE>

Company or rights to acquire such stock (including payments treated as such for
tax purposes) that are made in contemplation of the Merger or that are related
thereto.

         2.       Other than in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to
its obligations under the Agreements, the Company has made no transfer of any of
its assets (including any distribution of assets with respect to, or in
redemption of, stock) in contemplation of the Merger or during the Pre-Merger
Period.

         3.       The Company's principal reasons for participating in the
Merger are bona fide business purposes unrelated to taxes.

         4.       The Merger will be consummated in accordance with the
Reorganization Agreement without waiver or modification by any party of any
material provision thereof.

         5.       At the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company will have no
outstanding equity interests other than those disclosed in Section 2.3 of the
Reorganization Agreement. At the Effective Time of the Merger, except as
specified in the Reorganization Agreement, the Company will have no outstanding
warrants, options, or convertible securities or any other type of right
outstanding pursuant to which any person could acquire shares of the Company
stock or any other equity interest in the Company, other than those disclosed in
Section 2.3 of the Reorganization Agreement.

         6.       In the Merger, shares of voting stock of Parent will be
exchanged for shares of stock of the Company representing "Control" of the
Company. At the Effective Time of the Merger, there will exist no rights to
acquire the Company stock or to vote (or restrict or otherwise control the vote
of) shares of stock of the Company which, if exercised, would affect Parent's
acquisition and retention of control of the Company. For purposes of this
paragraph, shares of the stock of Company exchanged in the Merger for cash and
other property (including, without limitation, cash paid in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash paid to stockholders of the Company
perfecting dissenters' rights, if any and cash paid pursuant to Section 1.5(f)
of the Reorganization Agreement (the "Escrow Cash")) will be treated as shares
of stock of the Company outstanding on the date of the Merger but not exchanged
for shares of voting stock of Parent. As used in this letter, "Control" shall
consist of direct ownership of shares of stock possessing at least eighty
percent (80%) of the total combined voting power of shares of all classes of
stock entitled to vote and at least eighty percent (80%) of the total number of
shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. For purposes of
determining Control, a person shall not be considered to own shares of voting
stock if rights to vote such shares (or to restrict or otherwise control the
voting of such shares) are held by a third party (including a voting trust)
other than an agent of such person.

         7.       The total fair market value of all consideration other than
Parent Common Stock received by stockholders of the Company in the Merger
(including, without limitation, cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash paid to stockholders of the Company perfecting dissenters'
rights, if any and the Escrow Cash) will be less than twenty percent (20%) of
the aggregate fair market value of all shares of stock of the Company
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger.


                                       2.
<PAGE>

         8.       The Company has no plan or intention to issue additional
shares of stock after the Merger or take any other action, that would result in
Parent losing Control of the Company.

         9.       Except for transfers described in both Section 368(a)(2)(C) of
the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(k)(2), the Company has no plan
or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or any of the
assets acquired from Merger Sub in the Merger except for dispositions made in
the ordinary course of business or to pay expenses incurred by the Company
pursuant to the Merger.

         10.      The Company intends that, following the Merger, Parent or the
Company will continue the Company's historic business or use a significant
portion of the Company's historic business assets in a business following the
Merger.

         11.      The liabilities of the Company have been incurred by the
Company in the ordinary course of its business.

         12.      The fair market value of the Company's assets will, at the
Effective Time of the Merger, exceed the aggregate liabilities of the Company
plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which such assets are subject.

         13.      The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

         14.      The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

         15.      The Company has made no extraordinary distributions within the
meaning of Temporary Federal Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1T(e) with
respect to its stock, prior to and in connection with the Merger.

         16.      The Company has not redeemed and no related person with
respect to the Company, as such term is defined by Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(e)(3), has purchased any Company stock prior to and in connection with
the Merger.

         17.      Except with respect to (i) payments of cash to stockholders of
the Company in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) payments
of cash to stockholders of the Company perfecting dissenters' rights, if any,
and (iii) the Escrow Cash, one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of stock of
the Company outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will be exchanged solely
for Parent Common Stock.

         18.      The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock received by
each stockholder of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of the shares of stock of the Company surrendered in exchange therefor and
the sum of the Merger Consideration plus the Escrow Cash received by
stockholders of the Company (or the Stockholders' Agent) in exchange for their
shares of stock of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair market
value of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company immediately prior
to the Merger.


                                       3.
<PAGE>

         19.      Except as provided in Section 10.3 of the Reorganization
Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and each stockholder of
the Company will each pay separately his, her or its own expenses relating to
the Merger.

         20.      Except for amounts loaned by Parent to the Company pursuant to
the Credit Agreement, there is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between
Parent and the Company or between Merger Sub and the Company. No liabilities of
any person will be assumed by Parent or the Company in connection with the
Merger nor will any person transfer any assets subject to liabilities to Parent
or the Company as part of the Merger.

         21.      The terms of the Reorganization Agreement and the other
agreements relating thereto are the product of arm's length negotiations.

         22.      None of the compensation received by any stockholder-employee
of the Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their
shares of stock of the Company; none of the Parent Common Stock received by any
stockholder-employee of the Company will be separate consideration for, or
allocable to, any employment agreement or any covenants not to compete; and the
compensation paid to any stockholder-employee of the Company will be for
services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to third
parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services.

         23.      The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience
to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. The fractional share interests of each Company
stockholder will be aggregated, and no Company stockholder will receive cash in
an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common
Stock.

         24.      With respect to each instance, if any, in which shares of
stock of the Company have been purchased by a stockholder of Parent (a
"Stockholder") during the Pre-Merger period (a "Stock Purchase"): (i) to the
knowledge of the Company, (a) the Stock Purchase was not made by such
Stockholder as a representative, or for the benefit, of Parent, and (b) the
Stock Purchase was the product of arm's length negotiations; and (ii) the Stock
Purchase was not a formal or informal condition to consummation of the Merger.

         25.      The Company is authorized to make all of the representations
set forth herein.

         The undersigned recognizes that (i) your opinions will be based on,
among other things, the accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on
the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the
covenants and obligations contained in the Reorganization Agreement and the
various other documents related thereto, and (ii) your opinions will be subject
to certain limitations and qualifications including that they may not be relied
upon if any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of
such covenants or obligations are not satisfied in all material respects; and
(iii) your opinions will not address any tax consequence of the Merger or any
action taken in connection therewith except as expressly set forth in such
opinions.

         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the undersigned makes
no representations regarding any actions or conduct of the Company pursuant to
Parent's exercise of control over the Company after the Merger.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We have acted as special telecommunications regulatory counsel to CO
Space, Inc. (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary CO Space Services,
LLC (the "Subsidiary"). This opinion letter is being delivered to you pursuant
to Section 6.7(h) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization,
between you and Cowboy Acquisition Corp., dated as of May 26, 2000 (the
"Agreement"). All capitalized terms used herein which are not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

         Our opinion is limited to certain telecommunications regulatory matters
specifically related to the statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
governing intrastate telecommunications in Massachusetts and the rules,
regulations, and orders of the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications
and Energy ("MDTE") (collectively "Massachusetts Telecommunications Law"). We
express no opinion and assume no responsibility as to the applicability of any
United States, state, local, foreign, or regional laws or regulations,
including, but not limited to, other Massachusetts laws or laws governing the
corporate organization, authority to transact business, or tax liability of the
Company or of the Subsidiary.

         In this limited capacity, and for the purposes of this opinion, we have
reviewed the Agreement, and, although we have acted as special
telecommunications regulatory counsel to the Company and the Subsidiary in
connection with the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, we draw
your attention to the fact that we have not undertaken any on-site or other
physical inspections of the business or properties of the Company or of the
Subsidiary, or of any other

subsidiaries of the Company, and with respect to business practices,
operations, accounts, personnel or day-to-day affairs have not independently
verified the manner in which their respective businesses are operated.

         In our review, we have assumed without independent investigation (i)
the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) that where any signature purports to
have been made in a corporate, governmental, fiduciary, or other capacity, the
person who affixed such signature to such document had authority to do so; (iii)
the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals; (iv) the
conformity to authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as
certified, conformed, or photostatic copies; and (v) the conformity of all
provisions, terms, and conditions contained in documents submitted to us in
draft form with the provisions, terms, and conditions contained in the executed
final versions of such documents. We have also assumed, without independent
inquiry, that there are no agreements or understandings between or among the
Company or the Subsidiary and other parties other than those disclosed in the
Agreement that would expand, modify, or otherwise affect the terms of the
Agreement or the rights or obligations thereunder of the parties thereto, and
that the Agreement accurately and completely sets forth the agreement of all
parties thereto.

         In connection with this opinion as to matters of fact, other than
factual matters relating to the existence of Massachusetts Telecommunications
Law, we have relied upon the representations and warranties of the Company set
out in the Agreement and the Certificate of Responsible Officer ("Officer's
Certificate") (attached hereto as Schedule 1). We have not undertaken any
independent investigation to verify any such matters, and our opinion is
therefore, as to such factual matters, based solely upon such representations
and warranties. Whenever in this opinion we limit our opinion to "to our
knowledge," our statements are based solely on representations of officers of
the Company and any information that actually became known to the
telecommunications attorneys of this firm who are involved in representing the
Company in the course of their performance of such representation.

         For purposes of this opinion, we have made such examination of
Massachusetts Telecommunications Law as we have deemed necessary. We have not
undertaken to determine the existence of any actions, approvals, or proceedings,
whether outstanding, pending, or threatened, before persons or entities other
than the MDTE.

         This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no
obligation to notify you of any changes in this opinion as a result of any facts
that may come to our attention in the future, nor do we assume any obligation to
update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances which
may hereafter occur or come to our attention, or to assess the likelihood or
effect of any event, including any proceeding or appeal which hereafter may be
initiated by or before the MDTE, or any federal or state court or government
agency, or any changes in laws, rules, or regulations, or the

interpretation of such, which may hereafter occur, or of any material changes
in the terms of the transactions contemplated in the Agreement.

         Subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth in this letter,
to our knowledge and based on the Officer's Certificate attached hereto as
Schedule 1, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that:

         All necessary consents, approvals, authorizations or orders of, and
         filings, notices, registrations and qualifications with, the MDTE
         required under Massachusetts Telecommunications Law for the
         consummation of the Merger by the Company and the Subsidiary have been
         made or obtained.

         The opinion expressed in this letter is subject in all respects to the
following additional qualifications: (a) this opinion addresses only the Merger
and does not address any other transaction; (b) no opinion is rendered as to
matters not specifically referred to herein or as to any fact or circumstance
that hereafter may come to our attention or any change in law that hereafter may
occur, and under no circumstances are you to infer from anything stated or not
stated herein any opinion with respect to such matters; (c) all opinions
expressed in this letter are limited solely to the effect on the Merger of
Massachusetts Telecommunications Law as in effect on the date hereof with
respect to the Company and the Subsidiary, and we express no opinion as to the
effect of any other federal, state, local, foreign, or regional statute or
equitable doctrine or common law or of the regulations of any other agency or
administrative body other than the MDTE; (d) other than as expressly stated in
the previous paragraph, no opinion is rendered as to the compliance of the
Company or the Subsidiary in the past or in the future with any or all
conditions or other requirements of the United States Federal Communications
Commission ("FCC") or of the state commissions with primary regulatory
jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries ("State Commissions") contained in the orders, if any,
authorizing the operations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
otherwise imposed by statute, rule, regulation, or policy, and we assume no
obligation to ensure that the Company or its any of its subsidiaries complies
with such conditions or requirements; (e) we express no opinion as to the effect
of any failure by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to comply with any
conditions or requirements of the FCC, the MDTE, or the other State Commissions,
including the requirement to amend the tariff on file with the MDTE to reflect
post-merger changes in the name and/or terms and conditions of service, and (f)
we express no opinion with respect to any parties or entities other than the
Company and the Subsidiary. We are admitted to the District of Columbia Bar and,
with respect to any matters concerning Massachusetts Telecommunications Law, we
draw your attention to the fact that, although familiar with Massachusetts
Telecommunications Law, the members of the firm involved in the preparation of
this opinion letter are not admitted to the bar of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.

         This opinion is given solely for the benefit of, and may be relied upon

SECTION 5.        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE LENDER

         The Lender represents and warrants to the Borrowers as follows:

         5.1      AUTHORITY. This Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of
the Lender which is enforceable in accordance with its terms except as may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or
other laws of general application relating to or affecting enforcement of
creditors' rights and by general equitable principles.

         5.2      PURCHASE FOR OWN ACCOUNT. The Lender represents that it is
acquiring the Note solely for its own account and beneficial interest for
investment and not for sale or with a view to distribution of the Note or any
part thereof, has no present intention of selling (in connection with a
distribution or otherwise), granting any participation in or otherwise
distributing the same, and does not presently have reason to anticipate a change
in such intention. The Lender also represents that the entire legal and
beneficial interest of the Notes it is acquiring is being acquired for the
account of the Lender only and neither in whole nor in part for any other
person, and that any transfer of the Note will be made in compliance with the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and all other
applicable securities laws.

         5.3      INFORMATION AND SOPHISTICATION. The Lender acknowledges that
it has received all the information it has requested from the Borrowers and
considers necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to purchase the Note.
The Lender represents that it has had an opportunity to ask questions and
receive answers from the Borrowers regarding the terms and conditions of the
offering of the Notes and to obtain any additional information necessary to
verify the accuracy of the information given the Lender. The Lender further
represents that it has such knowledge and experience in financial and business
matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risk of this investment.

         5.4      ABILITY TO BEAR ECONOMIC RISK. The Lender acknowledges that
investment in the Note involves a high degree of risk, and represents that it is
able, without materially impairing its financial condition, to hold the Note for
an indefinite period of time and to suffer a

                                       4.
<PAGE>

complete loss on its investment. The Lender represents that it is an
"accredited investor" as that term is defined in the Act and the rules
promulgated thereunder.

         5.5      RESTRICTED SECURITIES; LIMITATION ON DISPOSITION.

                  (a)      The Lender understands that the Note are
characterized as "restricted securities" under the federal securities laws (and
are referred to for purposes of this SECTION 5.5 as the "RESTRICTED SECURITIES")
and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities may be
resold without registration under the Securities Act only in certain limited
sets of circumstances. In this connection, the Lender represents that it is
familiar with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Rule 144, as presently
in effect. The Lender understands that the Borrowers will be under no obligation
to make public the information necessary for the Lender to obtain the benefits
of Rule 144.

                  (b)      Without limiting the foregoing, the Lender agrees
that it will in no event make any disposition of any of the Restricted
Securities unless and until:

                           (i)      the Lender has obtained the Parent's prior
written consent to the disposition; and

                           (ii)     (A)     there is then in effect a
registration statement under the Securities Act covering such proposed
disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with said registration
statement; or

                                    (B)      the Lender shall have notified the
Parent of the details of the proposed disposition and, if the Parent so
reasonably requests, shall have provided the Parent with an opinion of counsel
for the Lender to the effect that such disposition will not require registration
of the Restricted Securities under the Securities Act, and such opinion of
counsel for the Lender shall have the concurrence of the Parent's counsel and
the Parent shall have advised the undersigned of such concurrence.

                  (c)      The Lender understands that the Parent's records will
be noted to reflect the restrictions on transferability of the Restricted
Securities contained herein and that certificates evidencing the Restricted
Securities may bear one or more of the following legends:

                           (i)      "These securities have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. They
may not be sold, offered for sale, pledged, or hypothecated in the absence of an
effective registration statement as to the securities under said Act or an
opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Parent that such registration is not
required."

                           (ii)     Any legend imposed or required pursuant to
applicable state securities law.

SECTION 6.         EXECUTION OF FURTHER DOCUMENTS. The Borrowers and the
Lender agree to execute any further documents or agreements and to take any
further acts that may be reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement. The Borrowers and the Lender further agree
that it will use its best efforts to obtain the signature of

"EVENT OF DEFAULT":

                  (a)      Default in the payment of any part of the principal
or interest of the Note when due and payable pursuant to the provisions thereof
if such default is not cured by the Borrowers within five (5) days after the
Lender has given the Parent written notice of such default; or

                  (b)      The institution by any Borrower of proceedings to be
adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the institution of
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against it or the filing by it of a
petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, or any other applicable federal or state law, or the consent by

reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any present or
future statute, law or regulation, such action shall not have been dismissed or
all orders or proceedings thereunder affecting the operations or the business of
any Borrower stayed, or if the stay of any such order or proceeding shall
thereafter be set aside, or if, within sixty (60) days after the appointment
without the consent or acquiescence of any Borrower of any trustee, receiver or
liquidator of any Borrower or of all or any substantial part of the properties
of any Borrower, such appointment shall not have been vacated; or

                  (d)      Any material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement (other than the provisions requiring payment on the Note) if such
breach is not cured by the Borrowers within forty-five (45) days after the
earlier of (i) the date upon which an executive officer of any Borrower knew of
such failure or (ii) the date upon which written notice thereof is given to the
Borrowers by the Lender.

         7.2      REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT.

                  (a)      Upon an Event of Default, the Lender may at any time
(unless all defaults shall theretofore have been remedied) at its option, by
written notice to the Borrowers, declare the Note to be due and payable,
whereupon the same shall forthwith mature and become due and payable, together
with interest accrued thereon, without presentment, demand, protest, or notice,
all of which are hereby waived.

                  (b)      In case any one or more Events of Default shall occur
and be continuing, the Lender may proceed to protect and enforce its rights by
an action at law, suit in equity, or other appropriate proceeding, whether for

<PAGE>

in this Agreement or in the Note or for an injunction against a violation of
any of the terms of this Agreement or of the Note, or in the aid of the
exercise of any power granted by this Agreement, the Notes, or by law. The
Borrowers shall pay to the Lender such further amount as shall be sufficient
to cover the cost and expenses of collection, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and disbursements. No course of dealing
and no delay on the part of the Lender in exercising any right shall operate
as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice the Lender's rights, powers, or
remedies. No right, power, or remedy conferred by this Agreement or by the
Note upon the Lender shall be exclusive of any rights, power, or remedy
referred to in this Agreement or in the Note, or now or hereafter available
at law, in equity, by statute, or otherwise.

and governed in all respects by, the laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

                  (b)      STOCKHOLDER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A JURY
TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ENFORCEMENT OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

         3.5      COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by the parties in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument.

         3.6      CAPTIONS. The captions contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.

         3.7      ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action or other legal proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement
is brought against Stockholder, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any
other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

         3.8      WAIVER. No failure on the part of Parent or Stockholders'
Agent to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
and no delay on the part of Parent or Stockholders' Agent in exercising any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a
waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial
exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy.
Neither Parent nor Stockholders' Agent shall be deemed to have waived any claim
available to Parent or Stockholders' Agent arising out of this Agreement, or any
power, right, privilege or remedy of Parent or Stockholders' Agent under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of Parent or Stockholders' Agent, as applicable; and any such waiver
shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in
which it is given.

         3.9      CONSTRUCTION.

                  (a)      For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context
requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include masculine and feminine genders.

                  (b)      The parties agree that any rule of construction to
the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall
not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.
