AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is dated as of August 12,
2017, by and between CenterState Banks, Inc., a Florida corporation
("CenterState"), and Sunshine Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation
("Sunshine" and, together with CenterState, the "Parties" and each a "Party").

 

W I T N E S S E T H

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Parties have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their respective
shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for
in this Agreement in which Sunshine will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into CenterState (the
"Merger"), with CenterState as the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Entity");

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into this
Agreement, all of the directors of Sunshine and Savings Bank (as defined
herein), have entered into voting agreements (each a "Voting Agreement" and
collectively, the "Voting Agreements"), substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A, dated as of the date hereof, with CenterState, pursuant
to which each such director has agreed, among other things, to vote all of the
Sunshine Common Stock owned by such director in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to the terms of
the Voting Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger; and

 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01.The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act (the
"FBCA"), and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") at the
Effective Time, Sunshine shall merge with and into CenterState pursuant to
this Agreement and the Plan of Merger, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B and made a part hereof (the "Plan of Merger").
CenterState shall be the Surviving Entity in the Merger and shall continue its
existence as a corporation under the laws of the State of Florida. As of the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sunshine shall cease.

   

Section 1.02.Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
articles of incorporation of CenterState in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Entity
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable Law. The bylaws of
CenterState in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with
applicable Law and the terms of such bylaws.

 

Section 1.03.Bank Merger. Except as provided below, immediately following the
Effective Time and sequentially but in effect simultaneously on the Closing
Date, Sunshine Bank, a federal stock savings bank and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Sunshine ("Savings Bank"), shall be merged (the "Bank Merger")
with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking association and a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank"), in
accordance with the provisions of applicable federal banking laws and
regulations, and CenterState Bank shall be the surviving bank (the "Surviving
Bank"). The Bank Merger shall have the effects as set forth under applicable
federal banking laws and regulations, and the boards of directors of the
Parties shall cause the board of directors of CenterState Bank and Savings
Bank, respectively, to approve a separate plan of merger and merger agreement
(the "Bank Plan of Merger") in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C, and cause the Bank Plan of Merger to be executed and delivered as
soon as practicable following the date of execution of this Agreement. Each
of CenterState and Sunshine shall also approve the Bank Plan of Merger in
their capacities as sole shareholders of CenterState Bank and Savings Bank,
respectively. As provided in the Bank Plan of Merger, the Bank Merger may be
abandoned at the election of CenterState Bank at any time, whether before or
after filings are made for regulatory approval of the Bank Merger unless such
abandonment would cause a material delay in the receipt of the Regulatory
Approvals, but if the Bank Merger is abandoned for any reason, Savings Bank
shall continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of CenterState under
its name.

 

Section 1.04.Directors and Officers. The current directors and officers of
CenterState shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as the
directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Entity until their
successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity. 

 

Section 1.05.Effective Time; Closing.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will
make all such filings as may be required to consummate the Merger and the Bank
Merger under applicable Law. The Merger shall become effective as set forth
in the articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") related to the Merger,
which will include the Plan of Merger, that shall be filed with the Department
of State of the State of Florida, as provided in the FBCA, on the Closing
Date, and with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, as
provided in the MGCL. The "Effective Time" of the Merger shall be the later
of (i) the date and time of filing of the Articles of Merger, or (ii) the date
and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of
Merger, which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after all of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI (other than conditions to be
satisfied at the Closing, which shall be satisfied or waived at the Closing)
have been satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof or such
later date as the Parties may agree.

 

(b)The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place on a date and time which shall be at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such date, the "Closing Date") at the
offices of CenterState, or such other place as the Parties may mutually agree.
At or prior to the Closing, there shall be delivered by CenterState and
Sunshine the Articles of Merger and such other certificates and other
documents required to be delivered under Article VI.

   

Section 1.06.Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
CenterState shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Sunshine and its Subsidiary and
their respective officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
CenterState and its Subsidiaries, and each or any of them, an irrevocable
power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such official corporate
capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts
as are necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of CenterState and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
are authorized in the name of Sunshine and its Subsidiaries or otherwise to
take any and all such action.

 

Section 1.07.Reservation of Right to Revise Structure. CenterState may at any
time and without the approval of Sunshine change the method of effecting the
business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent that
it deems such a change to be desirable; provided, however, that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued
to (x) Holders as Merger Consideration or (y) holders of Sunshine Stock
Options, each as currently contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) reasonably be
expected to materially impede or delay consummation of the Merger, (iii)
adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of Holders in connection
with the Merger or adversely limit or impact the qualification of the Merger
as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, or
(iv) require submission to or approval of Sunshine's shareholders after this
Agreement has been approved by Sunshine's shareholders. In the event that
CenterState elects to make such a change, the Parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the change.

 

ARTICLE II 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

Section 2.01.Merger Consideration. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or any shareholder of Sunshine:

 

(a)Each share of CenterState Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

 

(b)Each share of Sunshine Common Stock owned directly by CenterState, Sunshine
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and each share of Sunshine Common Stock that is remitted
to Sunshine prior to the Effective Time for purposes of repayment of the ESOP
loan balance as contemplated by Section 5.11(i) shall be cancelled and retired
at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto.

 

(c)Each share of Sunshine Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in Section 2.01(b)),
shall be converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Article II, into the right to receive 0.89 shares of CenterState Common Stock
(the "Merger Consideration"), and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
specified in Section 2.04.

   

Section 2.02.Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a)Each valid option to purchase shares of Sunshine Common Stock (each, a
"Sunshine Stock Option"), outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and be converted
into an option to purchase that number of shares of CenterState Common Stock
as shall equal the product obtained by multiplying the Merger Consideration
(the "Option Exchange Ratio") by that number of shares of Sunshine Common
Stock which such option entitled the holder thereof to purchase (rounded to
the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the Sunshine Stock Option
by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided however,
that in the event that the Merger Consideration is modified as a result of the
application of Section 2.09, then the Option Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted in order to reflect the impact of such modification to
the Merger Consideration. Except with respect to the adjustment described in
the preceding sentence, each Sunshine Stock Option shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms, including with respect to vesting and termination.

 

(b)Sunshine shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time,
all Sunshine Stock Options and any other Rights, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Sunshine Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of
such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Sunshine Common Stock
that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under
the Sunshine Stock Plans, or otherwise, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, terminated and
cancelled as of the Effective Time.

 

(c)At the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock outstanding
immediately prior thereto (each "Sunshine Restricted Stock") shall vest in
full and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and shall be treated as issued
and outstanding shares of Sunshine Common Stock for the purposes of this
Agreement, including but not limited to Section 2.01.

 

(d)Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of Sunshine (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Sunshine Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions, including obtaining
any necessary consents or amendments to the applicable award agreements and
equity plans, as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this Section
2.02. 

 

Section 2.03.Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time,
all shares of Sunshine Common Stock, when converted in accordance with Section
2.01, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
previously evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive for each such share of Sunshine Common Stock, the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock in
accordance with this Article II. At the Effective Time, holders of Sunshine
Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of
Sunshine, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration and cash in
lieu of fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock as provided under this
Article II. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of Sunshine of shares of Sunshine Common
Stock.

 

Section 2.04.Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, CenterState shall pay or cause to be paid to each
holder of a fractional share of CenterState Common Stock, rounded to the
nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest and
rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest in CenterState Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the CenterState Average Stock Price.

   

Section 2.05.Plan of Reorganization. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that
term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

 

Section 2.06.Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date, and provided that Sunshine has delivered, or caused to be
delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is necessary for the
Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange
Agent shall mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to each Holder appropriate
and customary transmittal materials, in a form satisfactory to CenterState and
Sunshine, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, as
well as instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided for in
this Agreement (the "Letter of Transmittal").

 

Section 2.07.Deposit of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Prior to the Effective Time, CenterState shall (i) deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, CenterState Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) in book-entry form equal to the aggregate
CenterState Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration (excluding any
fractional share consideration) (together with, to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.04) (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"), and (ii) instruct the
Exchange Agent to promptly pay such Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares upon receipt of a properly completed Letter of Transmittal
in accordance with this Agreement.

 

(b)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders
of Sunshine for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as any interest
or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange
Agent to CenterState. Any shareholders of Sunshine who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.07 and Section 2.08(a) shall thereafter look only
to CenterState for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each
share of Sunshine Common Stock such shareholder held as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for shares of Sunshine Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for
them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of CenterState
Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent
permitted by the law of abandoned property and any other applicable Law,
become the property of CenterState (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any Party shall be liable to any Holder represented by any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration (or any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. CenterState and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
Sunshine to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of any shares of Sunshine Common Stock represented by any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, CenterState and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any
Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such dispute, and will
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

   

Section 2.08.Delivery of Merger Consideration.

 

(a)Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry
Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder
will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Sunshine Common Stock
represented by such Holder's Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Exchange
Agent and CenterState, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver
cash and/or shares of CenterState Common Stock to a Holder to which such
Holder would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such Holder
surrenders the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing the shares of
Sunshine Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Article II, or, an
appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such
amount as may be required in each case by CenterState or the Exchange Agent.

 

(b)All shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by CenterState in respect of the
CenterState Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all shares of CenterState Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of
the CenterState Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share until such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of CenterState Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState Common
Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of CenterState
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender.

 

(c)CenterState (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as CenterState is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
CenterState or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 2.09.Anti-Dilution Provisions. If the number of shares of CenterState
Common Stock or Sunshine Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time shall be increased or decreased as a result of a stock split,
stock combination, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar transaction,
with respect to such stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted as
necessary to preserve the relative economic benefit to the Parties.

properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Sunshine is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes

reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine. Sunshine

recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except

individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Sunshine and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The

have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of Sunshine. The

of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
Sunshine or Sunshine Subsidiary is a party, or by which they or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause

aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Sunshine.

 

Section 3.05.Consents and Approvals. Except for (a) the filing of

registration statement on Form S‑4 in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, to be filed with the SEC by CenterState in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "S‑4")

Governmental Authority are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and
delivery by Sunshine of this Agreement or (B) the consummation by Sunshine of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (including the

Sunshine is not aware of any reason why the necessary Regulatory Approvals and
consents will not be received in order to permit consummation of the Merger
and Bank Merger on a timely basis.

 

Section 3.06.Reports.

 

(a)Sunshine and its Subsidiary have timely filed (or furnished, as applicable)
all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments
required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file (or
furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2015 with (i) any state regulatory
authority, (ii) the SEC, (iii) the Federal Reserve Board, (iv) the FDIC, and
(v) the OCC (each a "Regulatory Agency" and collectively, the "Regulatory
Agencies"), including any report, registration or statement required to be
filed (or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations
of the United States, any state, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith, except where the
failure to file such report, registration or statement or to pay such fees and
assessments, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine or its Subsidiary, as the
case may be. Except for examinations of Sunshine and its Subsidiary conducted
by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business, no Regulatory
Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of
Sunshine, investigation into the business or operations of Sunshine or its
Subsidiary since January 1, 2015, except where such proceedings or
investigation would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine or its Subsidiary.
There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory
Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of Sunshine its Subsidiary, which would reasonably be likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Sunshine.

 

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by Sunshine or its Subsidiary pursuant to the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") or the Exchange Act, as the
case may be, since January 1, 2015 (the "Sunshine SEC Reports") is publicly
available. No such Sunshine SEC Report, at the time filed, furnished or
communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they were made, not misleading, except that information filed or
furnished as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be
deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective
dates, all Sunshine SEC Reports filed or furnished under the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. As of the
date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Sunshine has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or material
unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Sunshine SEC
Reports.

 

Section 3.07.Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of Sunshine and its Subsidiary included (or
incorporated by reference) in Sunshine SEC Reports (including the related
notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of Sunshine and its Subsidiary, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash
flows, changes in shareholders' equity

   

and consolidated financial position of Sunshine and its Subsidiary for the
respective fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth
(subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments
normal in nature and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
Sunshine and its Subsidiary have been, since January 1, 2015, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements. Hacker Johnson and Smith, PA has
not resigned (or informed Sunshine that it intends to resign) or been
dismissed as independent public accountants of Sunshine as a result of or in
connection with any disagreements with Sunshine on a matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.

 

(b)Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine, neither Sunshine nor its
Subsidiary has any liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except,
(i) with respect to Sunshine and its Subsidiary, for those liabilities that
are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Sunshine included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2017 (including any notes thereto), (ii) for liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since June 30, 2017, or (iii) in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of Sunshine and its
Subsidiary are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Sunshine or its Subsidiary or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine. Sunshine (i) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Sunshine, including its Subsidiary, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Sunshine by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based
on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Sunshine's outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Sunshine Board of Directors (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Sunshine's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(y) to the knowledge of Sunshine, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Sunshine's internal controls over financial reporting (copies of such items in
subsections (x) and (y) have previously been made available by Sunshine to
CenterState). To the knowledge of Sunshine, there is no reason to believe that
Sunshine's chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be
able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2015, (i) neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary, nor, to the
knowledge of Sunshine, any director, executive officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of Sunshine or its Subsidiary, has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or, to the knowledge of Sunshine, oral, regarding the

(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and

this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b)There is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or regulatory restriction

Section 3.10.Taxes and Tax Returns.

 

(a)Each of Sunshine and its Subsidiary has duly and timely filed (taking into
account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary is the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material Taxes of
Sunshine and its Subsidiary that are due have been fully and timely paid. Each
of Sunshine and its Subsidiary has withheld and paid all material Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or
owing to any employee, creditor, shareholder, independent contractor or other
third party. Neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary has granted any extension or
waiver of the limitation period applicable to any material Tax that remains in

years up to and including December 31, 2012 have been examined by the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS") or are Tax Returns with respect to which the
applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to
extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a material
amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in
writing, against Sunshine or its Subsidiary. There are no pending or
threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other
proceedings regarding any material Taxes of Sunshine and its Subsidiary or the
assets of Sunshine and its Subsidiary. In the last six (6) years, neither
Sunshine nor its Subsidiary has been informed in writing by any jurisdiction
that the jurisdiction

   

believes that Sunshine or its Subsidiary was required to file any Tax Return
that was not filed. Sunshine has made available to CenterState true, correct,
and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing agreements
or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed in
the last six (6) years. There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes
not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of Sunshine or its Subsidiary.
Neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary is a party to or is bound by any Tax
sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than
such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Sunshine and its
Subsidiary). Neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was Sunshine) or (ii) has any liability for
the Taxes of any person (other than Sunshine or its Subsidiary) under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or
foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither
Sunshine nor its Subsidiary has been, within the past two (2) years or
otherwise as part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intended to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. Neither Sunshine
nor its Subsidiary has participated in a "listed transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). At no time during the
past five (5) years has Sunshine been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. Neither
Sunshine nor its Subsidiary will be required to include any material item of
income in, or to exclude any material item of deduction from, taxable income
in any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any (A) change in method of accounting, (B) closing agreement, (C)
intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in Treasury
Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign law), (D) installment sale or open transaction disposition
made on or prior to the Closing Date, or (E) prepaid amount received on or
prior to the Closing Date, in the case of (A), (C), (D) and (E), outside of
the ordinary course of business.

 

(b)As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal,
state, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, ad valorem, profits,
gains, property, capital, sales, transfer, use, license, payroll, employment,
social security, severance, unemployment, withholding, duties, excise,
windfall profits, intangibles, franchise, backup withholding, value added,
alternative or add-on minimum, estimated and other taxes, charges, fees,
levies or like assessments together with all penalties and additions to tax
and interest thereon.

 

(c)As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax Return" means any return,
declaration, report, claim for refund, estimate, or information return or
statement relating to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment thereto, and
including any amendment thereof, supplied or required to be supplied to a
Governmental Entity.

 

Section 3.11.Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Sunshine Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(a) sets forth a true and complete
list of all Sunshine Benefit Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, "Sunshine
Benefit Plans" means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")),
whether or not subject to ERISA, and all stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life
insurance, supplemental retirement, retention, bonus, employment, change in
control, termination or severance plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored or maintained by, or required
to be contributed to, Sunshine or its Subsidiary for the benefit of any
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of
Sunshine or its Subsidiary.

   

(b)Sunshine has heretofore made available to CenterState true and complete
copies of (i) each Sunshine Benefit Plan, including any amendments thereto and
all related trust documents, insurance contracts or other funding vehicles,
and (ii) to the extent applicable, (A) the most recent summary plan
description, if any, required under ERISA with respect to such Sunshine
Benefit Plan, (B) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed
with the IRS, (C) the most recently received IRS determination letter or IRS
advisory opinion letter, if any, relating to such Sunshine Benefit Plan, (D)
the most recently prepared actuarial report for each Sunshine Benefit Plan (if
applicable), and (E) all material correspondence to or from any Governmental
Entity received in the last three years with respect to such Sunshine Benefit
Plan.

 

(c)Each Sunshine Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither Sunshine nor its
Subsidiary has, within the prior three (3) years, taken any action to take
corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of
the IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to
any Sunshine Benefit Plan, and neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary has any
knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such
program.

 

(d)Sunshine Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(d) identifies each Sunshine
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(the "Sunshine Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination
or advisory opinion letter with respect to each Sunshine Qualified Plan and
the related trust, which letter has not been revoked (nor has revocation been
threatened in writing), and, to the knowledge of Sunshine, there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Sunshine Qualified
Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Sunshine Benefit Plan is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(e)Neither Sunshine nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains a Sunshine Benefit Plan
that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. No
Controlled Group Liability with respect to an employee benefit plan that is
not a Sunshine Benefit Plan has been incurred by Sunshine or its ERISA
Affiliates that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of
Sunshine, no condition exists that presents a material risk to Sunshine or its
ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Controlled Group Liability" means any and all liabilities (i)
under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections
412 and 4971 of the Code, and (iv) as a result of a failure to comply with the
continuing coverage requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code.

 

(f)None of Sunshine, its Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan
that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple
Employer Plan"), and none of Sunshine, its Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan
or Multiple Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as
those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in
full. For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means, with respect to
any entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade or business that is, or
was at the relevant time, a member of a group described in Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes or
included the first entity, trade or business, or that is, or was at the
relevant time, a member of the same "controlled group" as the first entity,
trade or business pursuant to Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA.

   

(g)Except as provided in Sunshine Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(g), neither
Sunshine nor its Subsidiary sponsors, has sponsored or has any obligation with
respect to any employee benefit plan that provides for any post-employment or
post-retirement health or medical or life insurance benefits for retired or
former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or similar state law.

 

(h)All contributions required to be made to any Sunshine Benefit Plan by
applicable law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Sunshine Benefit Plan, for any period in the prior three (3) years through the
date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Sunshine, as applicable, except as,
either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability to Sunshine and its Subsidiary.

 

(i)Except as would not, either individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to Sunshine or its Subsidiary,
there are no pending or, to Sunshine's knowledge, threatened claims (other
than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to Sunshine's
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists that may reasonably be expected to
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against Sunshine Benefit Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Sunshine Benefit Plans
or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Sunshine Benefit Plans.

 

(j)None of Sunshine, its Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could subject any of the
Sunshine Benefit Plans or their related trusts, Sunshine, its Subsidiary or
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates to any material unpaid tax or
material penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of
ERISA.

 

(k)Except as provided in Sunshine Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(k), the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of,
cause Sunshine or its Subsidiary to transfer or set aside any assets to fund
any benefits under any Sunshine Benefit Plan, or increase in the amount or
value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer,
director or other service provider of Sunshine or its Subsidiary. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as provided in Section
3.11(k) of the Sunshine Disclosure Schedule, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) by Sunshine or its
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (either
solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction
with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(l)Except as provided in Sunshine Disclosure Schedule Section 3.11(l), no
Sunshine Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 

(m)There are no pending or, to Sunshine's knowledge, threatened material labor
grievances or unfair labor practice claims or charges against Sunshine or its
Subsidiary, or any strikes or other material labor disputes against Sunshine
or its Subsidiary. Neither Sunshine nor its Subsidiary is party to or bound by
any collective bargaining or similar agreement with any labor organization, or
work rules or practices agreed to with any labor organization or employee
association applicable to employees of Sunshine or its Subsidiary and, to
Sunshine's knowledge, there are no organizing efforts by any union or other
group seeking to represent any employees of Sunshine or its Subsidiary.

   

(n)The Sunshine ESOP grants to its participants full voting rights as to all
shares of Sunshine Common Stock held by the Sunshine ESOP on behalf of such
participants and that have been allocated to their accounts.

 

Section 3.12.Compliance with Applicable Law.

 

(a)Sunshine and its Subsidiary hold, and have at all times since December 31,
2014 held, all licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their
respective properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except
where neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and
holding such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to
pay any fees or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine, and to the
knowledge of Sunshine, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary
license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Sunshine and its
Subsidiary have complied in all material respects with and are not in material
default or violation under any applicable law, statute, order, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Sunshine or its
Subsidiary, including (to the extent applicable to Sunshine or its
Subsidiary), but not limited to, all laws related to data protection or

any other law relating to bank secrecy, discriminatory lending, financing or
leasing practices, money-laundering prevention, Sections 23A and 23B of the
Federal Reserve Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and all agency requirements
relating to the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer
loans. Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine, neither Sunshine nor
its Subsidiary, or to the knowledge of Sunshine, any director, officer,

all contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether written or

policies, its management or its business (each, whether or not set

   

forth in Sunshine Disclosure Schedule, a "Sunshine Regulatory Agreement"), nor
has Sunshine or its Subsidiary been advised in writing or, to Sunshine's
knowledge, orally, by any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that
it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such
Sunshine Regulatory Agreement.

 

Section 3.15.Risk Management Instruments. Except as would not reasonably be
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Sunshine, all interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements, futures
and forward contracts and other similar derivative transactions and risk

obligation would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Sunshine. To the knowledge of
Sunshine, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or investigation. Sunshine is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment,

Except as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by CenterState to
Sunshine concurrently herewith (the "CenterState Disclosure Schedule");
CenterState hereby represents and warrants to Sunshine that the statements
contained in this Article IV are correct as of the date of this Agreement and
will be correct as of the Closing Date (as though made on and as of the
Closing Date), except as to any representation or warranty which specifically
speaks as of an earlier date (including without limitation representations
made as of "the date hereof"), which only need be correct as of such earlier
date. "Knowledge" or "knowledge" as to CenterState and any other phrase of
similar import means, with respect to any matter in question relating to
CenterState, of those individuals set forth on CenterState

   

Disclosure Schedule 4.01(a). CenterState has made a good faith effort to
ensure that the disclosure on each schedule of the CenterState Disclosure
Schedule corresponds to the section referenced herein. However, for purposes
of the CenterState Disclosure Schedule, any item disclosed on any schedule
therein or publicly filed with the SEC is deemed to be fully disclosed with
respect to all sections of this Agreement under which such item may be
relevant as and to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such
schedule that such item applies to such other section of this Agreement. 

 

Section 4.02.Organization, Standing and Authority.

 

(a)CenterState is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good

BHC Act. CenterState has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. CenterState is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState. True
and complete copies of CenterState Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been made available
by CenterState to Sunshine.

 

(b)Each Subsidiary of CenterState (a "CenterState Subsidiary") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not reasonably be likely, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own
or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
CenterState to pay dividends or distributions except under applicable state

restrictions on dividends or distributions generally applicable to all such
regulated entities. The deposit accounts of CenterState Bank are insured by
the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by

purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

 

Section 4.04.Authority; No Violation.

CenterState and its shareholders. Except for the adoption of the Bank Merger

sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of CenterState
are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by CenterState and (assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery by Sunshine) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of
CenterState, enforceable against CenterState in accordance with its terms
(except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions).

or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in
Section 4.05 are duly obtained and/or made, (x) violate any law, statute,
code, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction
applicable to CenterState, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective

provision of or the loss of any benefit under, constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or
cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the

provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which CenterState or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of clause (ii) above)
for such

   

violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or creations which either individually or in the aggregate would
not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.

Board under the BHC Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act and approval of such

Agreement or (B) the consummation by CenterState of the Merger and the other

any reason why the necessary Regulatory Approvals and consents will not be
received in order to permit consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger on a
timely basis.

 

Section 4.06.Reports.

 

(a)CenterState and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (or furnished,
as applicable), all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required
to file (or furnish, as applicable) since January 1, 2015 with any Regulatory
Agencies, including any report, registration or statement required to be filed
(or furnished, as applicable) pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of
the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency,
and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith, except where the failure to file such report, registration or
statement or to pay such fees and assessments, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState and its Subsidiaries. Except for examinations of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business, no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or,
to the knowledge of CenterState, investigation into the business or operations
of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2015, except where
such proceedings or investigation would not reasonably be likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
CenterState. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any
Regulatory Agency with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries, which
would reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.

 

(b)An accurate and complete copy of each final registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or
furnished to the SEC by CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2015
(the "CenterState SEC Reports") is publicly available. No such CenterState SEC
Report, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of
registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness
and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not

   

misleading, except that information filed or furnished as of a later date (but
before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of
an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all CenterState SEC Reports
filed or furnished under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act complied as
to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive
officer of CenterState has failed in any respect to make the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from or
material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the
CenterState SEC Reports.

 

Section 4.07.Financial Statements.

 

(a)The financial statements of CenterState and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the CenterState SEC Reports (including the
related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in
accordance with, the books and records of CenterState and its Subsidiaries,
(ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated
financial position of CenterState and its Subsidiaries for the respective
fiscal periods or as of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the
case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature
and amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv)
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the
periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in
the notes thereto. The books and records of CenterState and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2015, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements. Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed CenterState that
it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
CenterState as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with
CenterState on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b)Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState, neither CenterState
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due
or to become due), except (i) for those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of CenterState included in
its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017
(including any notes thereto), (ii) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2017, or (iii)
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c)The records, systems, controls, data and information of CenterState and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of CenterState or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that would not reasonably be likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on CenterState.
CenterState (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to CenterState, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of
CenterState by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the
date hereof, to CenterState's outside auditors and the audit committee of
CenterState's Board of

   

Directors (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect CenterState's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (y) to the knowledge of CenterState, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in CenterState's internal controls over financial
reporting. To the knowledge of CenterState, there is no reason to believe that
CenterState's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d)Since January 1, 2015, (i) neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of CenterState, any director, executive officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the
knowledge of CenterState, oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by CenterState or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by CenterState or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of
CenterState or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of CenterState, to
any director or officer of CenterState.

 

Section 4.08.Taxes.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking
into account all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns in all
jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all
such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects.
Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return. All material
Taxes of CenterState and its Subsidiaries that are due have been fully and
timely paid. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed, in each case, in writing, against CenterState
or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing
disputes, claims, audits, examinations or other proceedings regarding any
material Taxes of CenterState and its Subsidiaries or the assets of
CenterState and its Subsidiaries. There are no Liens for material Taxes
(except Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries has
been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise as part of a "plan (or series

the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Sunshine
Recommendation") and shall not withhold, withdraw, amend, modify, change or
qualify such recommendation in a manner adverse in any respect to the
interests of CenterState or take any other action or make any other public
statement inconsistent with such recommendation and the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus shall include the Sunshine Recommendation. In the event that there
is present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting
power to secure the Requisite Sunshine Shareholder Approval, Sunshine will not
adjourn or postpone the Sunshine Meeting unless Sunshine is advised by counsel
that failure to do so would result in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the
board of directors of Sunshine. Sunshine shall keep CenterState updated with
respect to the proxy solicitation results in connection with the Sunshine
Meeting as reasonably requested by CenterState.

 

Section 5.05.Registration Statement; Proxy Statement-Prospectus; NASDAQ
Listing.

 

(a)CenterState and Sunshine agree to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement (including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all
related documents) to be filed by CenterState with the SEC in connection with
the issuance of CenterState Common Stock in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Sunshine shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver to CenterState such financial statements and related analysis of
Sunshine, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" of Sunshine, as may be required in order
to file the Registration Statement, and any other report required to be filed
by CenterState with the SEC, in each case, in compliance with applicable Laws,
and shall, as promptly as practicable following execution of this Agreement,
prepare and deliver drafts of such information to CenterState to review.
Sunshine agrees to cooperate with CenterState and CenterState's counsel and
accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and
letters from Sunshine's independent auditors in connection with the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus. CenterState shall,
as soon as is practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the date
hereof, file the Registration Statement with the SEC. Each of CenterState and
Sunshine agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. CenterState also
agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state
securities Law or "blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Registration Statement
is declared effective under the Securities Act, Sunshine, at its own expense,
shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to
its shareholders.

 

(b)CenterState will advise Sunshine, promptly after CenterState receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of CenterState Common
Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of
any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of
any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff. CenterState
will provide Sunshine and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus,
and all responses to requests for additional information by and replies to
comments of the SEC prior to filing such with, or sending such to, the SEC,
and CenterState will provide Sunshine and its counsel with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the Sunshine Meeting there
shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration Statement, CenterState
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file
such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if required under applicable Law)
and cooperate with Sunshine to mail such amendment or supplement to Sunshine
shareholders (if required under applicable Law).

   

(c)CenterState shall cause the shares of CenterState Common Stock to be issued
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.06.Regulatory Filings; Consents.

 

(a)Each of CenterState and Sunshine and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
prepare all documentation to effect all filings, to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Regulatory Approvals and all other consents and approvals of a
Governmental Authority required to consummate the Merger in the manner
contemplated herein, (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and (iii) to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as expeditiously
as practicable; provided, however, that in no event shall CenterState be
required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other requirement which
would (i) prohibit or materially limit the ownership or operation by Sunshine
or its Subsidiary, or by CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries, of all or any
material portion of the business or assets of Sunshine or any of its
Subsidiaries or CenterState or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) compel CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of all or any material portion of the
business or assets of Sunshine or its Subsidiary or of CenterState or any of
its Subsidiaries or continue any portion of any Sunshine Regulatory Agreement
against CenterState after the Merger (together, the "Burdensome Conditions").
CenterState and Sunshine will furnish each other and each other's counsel with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any application, petition or any other statement or
application made by or on behalf of CenterState or Sunshine to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each party hereto shall have the right to review and approve
in advance all characterizations of the information relating to such party and
any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority,
other than material filed in connection therewith under a claim of
confidentiality. CenterState shall, as soon as is practicable, but no later
than thirty (30) days after the date hereof, make all filings with
Governmental Authorities. In addition, CenterState and Sunshine shall each
furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Authority prior to its filing.

 

(b)Sunshine will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and CenterState
shall reasonably cooperate with Sunshine at Sunshine's request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described
on Sunshine Disclosure Schedule 3.13(c). Each Party will notify the other
Party promptly and shall promptly furnish the other Party with copies of
notices or other communications received by such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries of any communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person (or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from
such Party, its Subsidiaries or its representatives). Sunshine will consult
with CenterState and its representatives as often as practicable under the
circumstances so as to permit Sunshine and CenterState and their respective
representatives to cooperate to take appropriate measures to obtain such
consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may result from
the foregoing.

 

Section 5.07.Publicity. CenterState and Sunshine shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other Party,
which shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable in

   

the circumstances), issue such press release or make such public statements as
may upon the advice of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations
of any stock exchanges. It is understood that CenterState shall assume primary
responsibility for the preparation of joint press releases relating to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.08.Access; Current Information.

 

(a)Subject to Section 5.21 hereof, upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, Sunshine agrees to
afford CenterState and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized representatives such access during normal business hours at any
time and from time to time throughout the period prior to the Effective Time
to Sunshine's and its Subsidiary's books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), information
technology systems, business, properties and personnel and to such other
information relating to them as CenterState may reasonably request and
Sunshine shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide any
appropriate notices to employees and/or customers in accordance with
applicable Law and Sunshine's privacy policy and, during such period, Sunshine
shall furnish to CenterState, upon CenterState's reasonable request, all such
other information concerning the business, properties and personnel of
Sunshine and its Subsidiary that is substantially similar in scope to the
information provided to CenterState in connection with its diligence review
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, Sunshine
will furnish to CenterState copies of the board packages distributed to the
board of directors of Sunshine or its Subsidiary, and minutes from the
meetings thereof and all committees thereof, copies of any internal management
financial control reports showing actual financial performance against plan
and previous period, and copies of any reports provided to the board of
directors of Sunshine or any committee thereof relating to the financial
performance, operations, or risk management of Sunshine.

 

(c)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each of Sunshine and CenterState will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives of the other
Party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of Sunshine
and its Subsidiary and CenterState and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Sunshine agrees to provide to CenterState (i) a copy
of each report filed by Sunshine or its Subsidiary with a Governmental
Authority within three (3) Business Days following the filing thereof unless
it is a confidential communication with a Governmental Authority and Sunshine
is prohibited by Law from sharing such report, (ii) a copy of Sunshine's
monthly loan trial balance within one (1) Business Day of the end of the
month, and (iii) a copy of Sunshine's monthly statement of condition and
profit and loss statement within five (5) Business Days of the end of the
month and, if requested by CenterState, a copy of Sunshine's daily statement
of condition and daily profit and loss statement, which shall be provided
within two (2) Business Days of such request.

 

(d)Upon reasonable advance notice, Sunshine shall permit, and shall cause its
Subsidiary to permit, CenterState or an environmental consulting firm selected
by CenterState, and at the sole expense of CenterState, to conduct such phase
I or phase II environmental audits, studies and tests on real property
currently owned, leased (to the extent permitted under the lease) or operated
by Sunshine or its Subsidiary. CenterState shall indemnify Sunshine and its
Subsidiary for all costs and expenses associated with returning the property
of Sunshine and its Subsidiary, as applicable, to its previous condition.

   

(e)No investigation by CenterState or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Sunshine set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the respective
obligations of CenterState and Sunshine to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(f)Sunshine shall not be required to give CenterState any documents (including
under Sections 5.08(a) and (b) herein) that disclose confidential discussions
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter
that Sunshine's board of directors has been advised by counsel that such
distribution to CenterState may violate a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or may result in a waiver of
Sunshine's attorney-client privilege. In the event any of the restrictions in
this Section 5.08(f) shall apply, Sunshine shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers, decrees and
approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues relating to
documents prepared or held by third parties (including work papers), and the
Parties will make appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including
adopting additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of
sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

 

Section 5.09.No Solicitation by Sunshine; Superior Proposals.

 

(a)Sunshine shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiary and each of their
respective officers, directors and employees not to, and will not authorize
any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, affiliates or other agents of Sunshine or Sunshine's Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Sunshine Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than
CenterState) any information or data with respect to Sunshine or its
Subsidiary or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any
Person from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which Sunshine is a party; or (iv) enter
into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition
Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating
to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by
any of the Sunshine Representatives, whether or not such Sunshine
Representative is so authorized and whether or not such Sunshine
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Sunshine or otherwise, shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Sunshine. Sunshine and its
Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the Sunshine Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing
or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any inquiry,
offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from CenterState),
whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Sunshine or its Subsidiary; (B) any transaction pursuant
to which any third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through
sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the
assets of Sunshine or its Subsidiary; (C) any issuance, sale or other
disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase or securities convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of Sunshine

   

or its Subsidiary; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning 20%
or more of any class of equity securities of Sunshine or its Subsidiary; or
(E) any transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of
the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the foregoing. 

 

(b)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(a) or any other provision of this Agreement,
prior to the Sunshine Meeting, Sunshine may take any of the actions described
in Section 5.09(a)(ii) if, but only if, (i) Sunshine has received a bona fide
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.09; (ii) the board of directors of Sunshine determines in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (B) it is reasonably necessary to take such actions to comply with its
fiduciary duties to Sunshine's shareholders under applicable Law; (iii)
Sunshine has provided CenterState with at least three (3) Business Days' prior
notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access
to any information or data with respect to Sunshine or its Subsidiary or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, Sunshine receives from such
Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Sunshine
than those contained in the confidentiality agreement with CenterState.
Sunshine shall promptly provide to CenterState any non-public information
regarding Sunshine or its Subsidiary provided to any other Person which was
not previously provided to CenterState, such additional information to be
provided no later than the date such information is provided to such other
party.

 

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
Sunshine or its Subsidiary, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding Sunshine Common Stock
or more than 50% of the assets of Sunshine and its Subsidiary, taken as a
whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities and (ii) that
the board of directors of Sunshine determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A)
is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all conditions
contained therein and the person making such Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by CenterState in
response to such Acquisition Proposal as contemplated by Section 5.09(e), such
proposal, is more favorable to the shareholders of Sunshine from a financial
point of view than the Merger.

 

(c)Sunshine shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify CenterState in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought
to be initiated or continued with, Sunshine or the Sunshine Representatives,
in each case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice
shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of
written materials relating to such proposal, offer, information request,
negotiations or discussion, providing copies of such materials (including
e-mails or other electronic communications), except to the extent (i) that
such materials constitute confidential information of the party making such
offer or proposal under an effective confidentiality agreement, (ii)
discussions of such materials jeopardizes the attorney-client privilege or
(iii) disclosure of such materials contravenes any law, rule, regulation,
order, judgment or decree). Sunshine agrees that it shall keep CenterState
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request).

   

(d)Subject to Section 5.09(e), Neither the board of directors of Sunshine nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or propose
to withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to CenterState in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), the Sunshine Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the Sunshine
Recommendation within three (3) Business Days following a request by
CenterState, or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with the
Sunshine Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with the Sunshine Recommendation
(it being understood that taking a neutral position or no position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification
of the Sunshine Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into (or cause
Sunshine or its Subsidiary to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any
Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into
in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.09(b)) or (B) requiring
Sunshine to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(e)Notwithstanding Section 5.09(d) and subject to compliance with this Section
5.09(e), prior to the approval of the Merger at the Sunshine Meeting, the
board of directors of Sunshine may approve or recommend a Superior Proposal to
the Sunshine shareholders and withdraw, qualify, amend or modify the Sunshine
Recommendation or take any of the other actions otherwise prohibited by
Section 5.09(a) (a "Sunshine Subsequent Determination") after the fifth (5th)
Business Day following CenterState's receipt of a notice (the "Notice of
Superior Proposal") from Sunshine advising CenterState that the board of
directors of Sunshine has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.09) constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the
board of directors of Sunshine has determined in good faith, after
consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, that the failure to take such actions would be
reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties to Sunshine's shareholders
under applicable law, (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period after
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal by CenterState (the "Notice
Period"), Sunshine and the board of directors of Sunshine shall have
cooperated and negotiated in good faith with CenterState to make such
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable Sunshine to proceed with the Sunshine Recommendation
without a Sunshine Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that
CenterState shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
(iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been proposed by CenterState
since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal, the board of directors
of Sunshine has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i)
of this Section 5.09(e) and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior
Proposal, Sunshine shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal to CenterState and again comply with the requirements of this Section
5.09(e), except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business
Days.

 

(f)Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit Sunshine or the board of directors of Sunshine from complying with
Sunshine's obligations required under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; provided, however, that any such disclosure relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed a change in the Sunshine Recommendation unless the board
of directors of Sunshine reaffirms the Sunshine Recommendation in such
disclosure.

   

Section 5.10.Indemnification. 

 

(a)For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in any
event subject to the provisions of Section 5.10(b)(iv), CenterState shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors, officers
and employees of Sunshine and its Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative arising out of actions or
omissions of such persons in the course of performing their duties for
Sunshine or such Subsidiary occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (each a "Claim"),
to the same extent as such persons have the right to be indemnified pursuant
to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Sunshine or similar governing
documents of such Subsidiary in effect on the date of this Agreement and to
the extent permitted by applicable Maryland Law. CenterState shall pay such
expenses to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by the
provisions of Maryland Law and Sunshine's articles of incorporation and
bylaws. 

 

(b)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.10 shall promptly notify CenterState upon learning of any Claim, provided
that, failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of CenterState
under this Section 5.10, unless, and only to the extent that, CenterState is
materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the
event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time), (i) CenterState shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and CenterState shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for
any legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof
except that if CenterState elects not to assume such defense, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and CenterState
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties (provided that CenterState shall only be obligated to pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of one such counsel), (ii) the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) CenterState
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent and (iv) CenterState shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if such indemnification would be in violation of any
applicable federal or state banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that
a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Laws, whether or not related
to banking Laws.

 

(c)For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, CenterState
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide director's and
officer's liability insurance (herein, "DandO Insurance") that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Sunshine or its
Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby),
which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as
that coverage currently provided by Sunshine; provided that, if CenterState is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 5.10,
CenterState will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably
available (subject to the limitations described below in this Section
5.10(d)); and provided, further, that officers and directors of Sunshine or
its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall CenterState be
required to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an
amount equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by Sunshine for DandO Insurance
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium").
If the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium,
CenterState shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

   

(d)If CenterState or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CenterState and
its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

Section 5.11.Employees; Benefit Plans.

 

(a)Following the Effective Time, CenterState shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees who are full time employees of Sunshine or its Subsidiary
on the Closing Date ("Covered Employees") that provide employee benefits and
compensation opportunities which, in the aggregate, are substantially
comparable to the employee benefits and compensation opportunities that are
made available on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis to similarly situated
employees of CenterState or its Subsidiaries, as applicable; provided,
however, that in no event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen plan of CenterState or its Subsidiaries.
CenterState shall give the Covered Employees full credit for their prior
service with Sunshine and its Subsidiary (i) for purposes of eligibility
(including initial participation and eligibility for current benefits) and
vesting under any qualified or non-qualified employee benefit plan maintained
by CenterState and in which Covered Employees may be eligible to participate
and (ii) for all purposes under any welfare benefit plans, vacation plans,
severance plans and similar arrangements maintained by CenterState.

 

(b)With respect to any employee benefit plan of CenterState that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, CenterState or its applicable Subsidiary shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such CenterState or
Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee and his or
her covered dependents to the extent such condition was or would have been
covered under the Sunshine Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize any
health, dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered
Employee and his or her covered dependents in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable copayment, deductibles
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental,
vision or other welfare plan. Neither CenterState nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall terminate the existing coverage of any Covered Employee or his or her
dependents under any of the Sunshine or Sunshine Subsidiary health plans prior
to the time such Covered Employees and their dependents become eligible to
participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees
of CenterState or any CenterState Subsidiary and their dependents.

 

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, Sunshine shall take, and shall cause its
Subsidiary to take, all actions requested by CenterState that may be necessary
or appropriate to (i) cause one or more Sunshine Benefits Plans to terminate
as of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the
Effective Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any
Sunshine Benefit Plan to cease as of the Effective Time, or as of the date
immediately preceding the Effective Time, (iii) cause the continuation on and
after the Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy
relating to any Sunshine Benefit Plan for such period as may be requested by
CenterState, or (iv) facilitate the merger of any Sunshine Benefit Plan into
any employee benefit plan maintained by CenterState or a CenterState
Subsidiary. All resolutions, notices, or other documents issued, adopted or
executed in connection with the implementation of this Section 5.11(c) shall
be subject to CenterState's reasonable prior review and approval, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If CenterState requires
Sunshine to terminate a medical plan having a flexible spending arrangement
("FSA") under Code Section 125, Sunshine and each of its Subsidiaries may
continue its FSA through the Effective Time.

   

(d)Nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be construed to limit the right of
CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date,
Sunshine and its Subsidiary) to amend or terminate any Sunshine Benefit Plan
or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall anything in this
Section 5.11 be construed to require CenterState or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, Sunshine and its Subsidiary) to retain
the employment of any particular Covered Employee for any fixed period of time
following the Closing Date, and, except as otherwise provided pursuant to
Section 6.03(h), the continued retention (or termination) by CenterState or
any of its Subsidiaries of any Covered Employee subsequent to the Effective
Time shall be subject in all events to CenterState's or its applicable
Subsidiary's normal and customary employment procedures and practices,
including customary background screening and evaluation procedures, and
satisfactory employment performance.

 

(e)If, within six (6) months after the Effective Time, unless otherwise
addressed in an employment agreement entered into with CenterState Bank, any
Covered Employee who is terminated by CenterState or its Subsidiaries other

however, that in no event will the total amount of severance for any single
Covered Employee be less than four (4) weeks of such base salary nor greater

necessary to correct any information in such Sunshine Disclosure Schedule
which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or
amendment to any Sunshine Disclosure Schedule or provision of information
relating to the subject matter of any Sunshine Disclosure Schedule after the
date of this Agreement shall operate to cure any breach of a representation or
warranty made herein or have any effect for the purpose of determining

litigation if such settlement requires the payment of money damages, without
the written consent of CenterState (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) unless the payment of any such damages by Sunshine is reasonably
expected by Sunshine, following consultation with outside counsel, to be fully
covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid by Sunshine) under Sunshine's

ARTICLE VII 

TERMINATION

 

Section 7.01.Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the

entitle the terminating party not to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby under Section 6.02(a) (in the case of a breach of a representation or
warranty by CenterState) or Section 6.03(a) (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by Sunshine).

board of directors of Sunshine so determines by a vote of the majority of the
members of the entire Sunshine Board, at any time during the five-day period
commencing with the Determination Date (as defined below), if both of the
following conditions are satisfied: 

 

(A) The quotient obtained by dividing the CenterState Average Stock Price by
the Initial CenterState Market Price (as defined below) (the "CenterState
Ratio") shall be less than 0.85; and

 

(B) (x) the CenterState Ratio shall be less than (y) the quotient obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each

(such number in this clause (B)(y) that results from dividing the Final Index
Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date being referred to herein as the
"Index Ratio");

 

subject, however, to the following three sentences. If Sunshine elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 7.01(i), it shall give
written notice to CenterState. During the five-day period commencing with its
receipt of such notice, CenterState shall have the option to increase the
consideration to be received by the holders of Sunshine Common Stock
hereunder, either by adjusting the Merger Consideration, or by providing a
cash payment so that the merger consideration or the combination of such cash
payment plus the Merger Consideration, equals the lesser of (x) a number
(rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the
product of the Initial CenterState Market Price, 0.85 and the Merger
Consideration by (B) the CenterState Average Stock Price and (y) a number

product of the Index Ratio and the Merger Consideration by (B) the
CenterState Ratio. If CenterState so elects within such five-day period, it
shall give prompt written notice to Sunshine of such election and the adjusted

notification of such termination; and (ii) in the event that after the date of

Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of Sunshine or has
been made directly to its shareholders generally or any Person shall have
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to

the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination,

pay CenterState the Termination Fee, provided, that for purposes of this
Section 7.02(a)(ii), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%."

 

(b)Sunshine and CenterState each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, CenterState would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if Sunshine fails promptly to pay any
amounts due under this Section 7.02, Sunshine shall pay interest on such
amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual
payment at the rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest
published from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or
any successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on
the date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the
costs and expenses of CenterState (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties agree that if Sunshine pays or causes to be paid to CenterState the
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), Sunshine (or any successor
in interest of Sunshine) will not have any further obligations or liabilities
to CenterState with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.03.Effect of Termination. Except as set forth in Section 7.02(c),
termination of this Agreement will not relieve a breaching party from

EXHIBIT A

 

SHAREHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT

 

This Shareholder Voting Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
12th day of August, 2017, by and between CenterState Banks, Inc., a Florida
corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned holder ("Shareholder") of
Common Stock (as defined herein).

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Shareholder, either in his or her sole
capacity or jointly, is entitled to dispose of (or to direct the disposition
of) and to vote (or to direct the voting of) the number of shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Sunshine Bancorp,
Inc. ("Company"), indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the
heading "Total Number of Shares of Common Stock Subject to this Agreement"
(such shares of Common Stock, which shall exclude: (i) any shares of Common
Stock underlying any outstanding equity rights, together with any other shares
of Common Stock the voting power over which is acquired by Shareholder during
the period from and including the date hereof through and including the date
on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; and (ii),
any securities beneficially owned by the undersigned as a trustee or fiduciary
where the Shareholder does not have voting power , are collectively referred
to herein as the "Shares");

 

WHEREAS, CenterState and Company propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"; for purposes
of this Agreement, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement),
pursuant to which, among other things, Company will merge with and into
CenterState (the "Merger"); and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement, Shareholder is executing this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to,
CenterState entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by CenterState in connection therewith,
Shareholder and CenterState, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

 

1.Agreement to Vote Shares. Shareholder agrees that, while this Agreement is
in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of Company, however called, or at
any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances in which Shareholder is
entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval, except as otherwise
agreed to in writing in advance by CenterState, Shareholder shall:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

appear at each such meeting or otherwise cause the Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum; and 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

vote (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the Shares as to which
Shareholder has, directly or indirectly, the right to vote or direct the
voting, (i) in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, any
amendments or modifications of the terms thereof adopted in accordance with
the terms thereof); (ii) against any action or agreement that would result in
a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation
or agreement of Company contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder
contained in this Agreement; and (iii) against any 

---|---|--- 

      



 |  |  

Acquisition Proposal or any other action, agreement or transaction that is
intended, or could reasonably be expected, to impede, interfere or be
inconsistent with, delay, postpone, discourage or materially and adversely
affect consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
or this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of Company, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

 

2.No Transfers. While this Agreement is in effect and prior to any meeting of
shareholders of Company called in connection with the Merger, Shareholder
agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, assign or
otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment or other
arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, pledge,
assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares; provided, however, that
the following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will or
operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; (b)
transfers pursuant to any pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in
writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement;
(c) transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each
transferee agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the
terms of this Agreement; (d) the disposition or surrender of Shares in
connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of equity rights as
permitted by the Merger Agreement; (e) to any immediate family member of the
undersigned, or to a trust for the benefit of the undersigned or his or her
immediate family members or upon the undersigned's death; provided that, as a
precondition to such permitted transfer, the transferee has agreed in writing
to abide by the terms of this Agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to
CenterState; and (f) such transfers as CenterState may otherwise permit in its
sole discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms
of this Section 2 shall be null and void. 

 

3.Representations and Warranties of Shareholder. Shareholder represents and
warrants to and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

    



 |  

(a)

 |  

Shareholder has all requisite capacity and authority to enter into and perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(b)

 |  

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Shareholder, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by CenterState,
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles
of equity. 

---|---|--- 

 

    



 |  

(c)

 |  

The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder does not, and the
performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations hereunder and the
consummation by Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby will not,
violate or conflict with, or constitute a default under, any agreement,
instrument, contract or other obligation or any order, arbitration award,
judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party or by which Shareholder is
bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which Shareholder is subject or,
in the event that Shareholder is a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, trust or other entity, any charter, bylaw or other organizational
document of Shareholder. 

---|---|--- 

      



 |  

(d)

 |  

Shareholder is the direct or joint owner of the Shares. Shareholder does not
have sole or shared voting or dispositive power over any shares of capital
stock of Company other than the Shares or any other securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for such capital stock, other than any
Company Stock Options. Shareholder has the right to vote the Shares, and none
of the Shares is subject to any voting trust or other agreement, arrangement
or restriction with respect to the voting of the Shares, except as
contemplated by this Agreement. The Shares do not include shares over which
Shareholder exercises control in a fiduciary capacity for any other person or
entity that is not an Affiliate of Shareholder, and no representation by
Shareholder is made with respect thereto. 

---|---|--- 

 

4.No Solicitation. From and after the date hereof until the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6 hereof, Shareholder, in his, her or its
capacity as a shareholder of Company, shall not, nor shall Shareholder in such
capacity authorize any shareholder, member, partner, officer, director,
advisor or representative of Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates
to (and, to the extent applicable to Shareholder, such Shareholder shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any of his, her or its
representatives or affiliates to), (a) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer
or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than CenterState) any information or data with respect to
Company or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
(d) solicit proxies with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than the
Merger and the Merger Agreement) or otherwise encourage or assist any party in
taking or planning any action that would reasonably be expected to compete
with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the timely
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or (e) initiate a shareholders' vote or action by consent of
Company's shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

5.Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys' Fees. Shareholder acknowledges
that it is a condition to the willingness of CenterState to enter into the
Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and that
it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to CenterState if
Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and
that, in the event of any such failure, CenterState will not have an adequate
remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such
failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
CenterState has an adequate remedy at law. In addition, after notice to
Shareholder, CenterState shall have the right to inform any third party that
CenterState reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating
with Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of CenterState
hereunder, and that participation by any such third party with Shareholder in
activities in violation of Shareholder's agreement with CenterState set forth
in this Agreement may give rise to claims by CenterState against such third
party. All expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

 

6.Term of Agreement; Termination. The term of this Agreement shall commence
on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon: (i) termination of the Merger Agreement, or
(ii) the consummation of the Merger; provided however, that the transfer
restrictions in Section 2 hereof shall be automatically terminated upon the
receipt of requisite shareholder approval of Sunshine. Upon such termination,
no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder;
provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

  7.Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provision hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provision hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party. 

 

8.Severability. In the event that any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Agreement, and the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
substitute a valid, legal and enforceable provision which, insofar as
practical, implements the purpose and intents of this Agreement. 

 

9.Capacity as Shareholder. This Agreement shall apply to Shareholder solely
in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Company, and it shall not
apply in any manner to Shareholder in any capacity as a director, officer or
employee of Company or in any other capacity. For avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
restrict Shareholder or any of his, her or its affiliates who is or becomes
during the term hereof a member of the Board of Directors or an officer of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from acting, omitting to act or refraining
from taking any action, solely in such person's capacity as a member of the
Board of Directors or as an officer of Company (or as an officer or director
of any of its Subsidiaries) consistent with his or her fiduciary duties in
such capacity under applicable law, including under Section 5.09 of the Merger
Agreement.

 

10.Governing Law; Venue. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to any
applicable conflicts of law principles or any other principle that could
require the application of the law of any other jurisdiction. The sole and
exclusive venue for any civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be the courts of record of
the State of Florida in Polk County or the United States District Court,
Middle District of Florida. Each party consents to the jurisdiction of such
Florida Court in any such civil action, counterclaim, proceeding, or
litigation and waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such civil
action, counterclaim, proceeding, or litigation in such Florida Court.
Service of any court paper may be effected on such party by mail, as provided
in this Agreement, or in such other manner as may be provided under applicable
laws, rules of procedure or local rules.

 

11.WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.

  12.Further Assurances. Shareholder agrees not to commence or participate in,
and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action
with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against CenterState,
Company or any of their respective successors relating to the negotiation,
execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger. From time to time prior to the termination of this
Agreement, at CenterState's request and without further consideration,
Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and take all
such further action as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
actions and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

 

13.Disclosure. To the extent such information is required to be included,
Shareholder hereby permits CenterState to publish and disclose in the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus and S-4 (including, without limitation, all related
documents and schedules filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission)
his, her or its identity and ownership of shares of Common Stock and the
nature of Shareholder's commitments, arrangements and understandings pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

14.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (i) when delivered personally
to such party, or (ii) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail, or (iii) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
to such other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days'

Merger, at the Effective Time, Sunshine shall be merged with and into
CenterState in accordance with the Florida Business Corporation Act and the
Maryland General Corporation Law. CenterState shall be the surviving
corporation resulting from the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
continue to exist and to be governed by the laws of the State of Florida under
the corporate name "CenterState Banks, Inc." The Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the liabilities of Sunshine.

 

2.2Effective Time. The Merger contemplated by this Plan of Merger shall be
effective at the date and time set forth in the Articles of Merger filed with
the Secretary of State of Florida and with the Maryland State Department of
Assessments and Taxation.

 

2.3Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the articles
of incorporation of CenterState in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law. The amended and

Time shall be the amended and restated bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of

  SECTION 3

 

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

 

Each share of CenterState common stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger

 

Each share of common stock of Sunshine owned directly by CenterState, Sunshine
or any of their respective subsidiaries (other than shares in trust accounts,
managed accounts and the like for the benefit of customers or shares held as
collateral for outstanding debt previously contracted) immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and each share of Sunshine common stock that is remitted
to Sunshine prior to the Effective Time for purposes of repaying amounts owed
by the Sunshine Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan to Sunshine, shall be
cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

Each share of common stock of Sunshine issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares described in Section 3 above),
shall be converted into the right to receive 0.89 shares of CenterState common
stock (the "Merger Consideration"), and any cash in lieu of fractional shares.
CenterState shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a fractional share
of CenterState common stock, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share,
an amount of cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent)
determined by multiplying the fractional share interest in CenterState common
stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the average closing
price of CenterState common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market for
the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior
to the later of (i) the day on which the last required regulatory approval for
consummation of the Merger is obtained without regard to any requisite waiting
period, or (ii) the date on which Sunshine shareholders approve the Merger.

 

If the number of shares of CenterState common stock or Sunshine common stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall be increased or
decreased as a result of a stock split, stock combination, stock dividend,
recapitalization or similar transaction, with respect to such stock, and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted as necessary to preserve the
relative economic benefit to CenterState and Sunshine.

 

SECTION 4

 

Stock-Based Awards

 

Each valid option to purchase shares of Sunshine common stock (each, a
"Sunshine Stock Option"), outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and be converted
into an option to purchase that number of shares of CenterState common stock
as shall equal the product obtained by multiplying the Merger Consideration
(the "Option Exchange Ratio") by that number of shares of Sunshine common
stock which such option entitled the holder thereof to purchase (rounded to
the nearest whole share), and at an exercise price equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of the Sunshine Stock Option
by the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest cent); provided, however,
that if the Merger Consideration is modified as a result of the application of
Section 3, then the Option Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted in
order to reflect the impact of such modification to the Merger Consideration.

  At the Effective Time, each share of Sunshine restricted stock outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall vest in full and the restrictions thereon
shall lapse, and shall be treated as issued and outstanding shares of Sunshine
common stock for purposes of this Plan of Merger.

 

SECTION 5

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

5.1Further Assurances. Each party to this Plan of Merger agrees to do such
things as may be reasonably requested by the other party in order to more

EXHIBIT D

 

DIRECTOR NON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

 

This Non-Competition and Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement"), is
entered into as of the 12th day of August, 2017, by and between CenterState
Banks, Inc., a Florida corporation ("CenterState"), and the undersigned
individual ("Director").

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
August 12, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement") by and between CenterState and
Sunshine Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Company"), Company will merge
with and into CenterState (the "Merger"), as a result of which Sunshine Bank,
a federal stock savings bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Company (the
"Bank"), will merge with and into CenterState Bank, N.A., a national banking
association and wholly owned subsidiary of CenterState ("CenterState Bank");

 

WHEREAS, Director is a shareholder of Company and/or the Bank and, as a result
of the Merger and pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, Director and/or the Company shareholders are expected to receive
significant consideration in exchange for the shares of Company common stock
held by Director;

 

WHEREAS, prior to the date hereof, Director has served as a member of the
Board of Directors of Company and/or the Bank, and, therefore, Director has
knowledge of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets (each as
hereinafter defined);

 

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, CenterState will succeed to all of the
Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, for which CenterState, as of the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), will have paid valuable
consideration and desires reasonable protection; and

 

WHEREAS, it is a material prerequisite to the consummation of the Merger that
certain directors of Company, including Director, enter into this Agreement;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants
and undertakings herein contained, CenterState and Director, each intending to
be legally bound, covenant and agree as follows:

 

1.Restrictive Covenants. 

 

(a)Director acknowledges that (i) CenterState has separately bargained for the
restrictive covenants in this Agreement; and (ii) the types and periods of
restrictions imposed by the covenants in this Agreement are fair and
reasonable to Director and such restrictions will not prevent Director from
earning a livelihood.

 

(b)Having acknowledged the foregoing, solely in the event that the Merger is
consummated, Director covenants and agrees with CenterState as follows:

 

(i)From and after the Effective Time, Director will not disclose or use any
Confidential Information or Trade Secret for a period of twelve (12) months
from the Effective Time, except for any disclosure that is required by
applicable law or court order. In the event that Director is required by law
or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, Director will: 

  (i) if and to the extent permitted by such law or court order provide
CenterState with prompt notice of such requirement prior to the disclosure so
that CenterState may waive the requirements of this Agreement or seek an
appropriate protective order at CenterState's sole expense; and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that any Confidential
Information disclosed will be accorded confidential treatment. If, in the
absence of a waiver or protective order, Director is nonetheless, in the
opinion of his counsel, required to disclose Confidential Information,
disclosure may be made only as to that portion of the Confidential Information
that counsel advises Director is required to be disclosed.

 

(ii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a period
beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the Effective
Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior written consent
of CenterState), on Director's own behalf or in the service or on behalf of
others, solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of CenterState, CenterState
Bank, Company or the Bank (each a "Protected Party"), including known actively
sought prospective customers of the Bank as of the Effective Date, for the
purpose of providing products or services that are Competitive (as hereinafter
defined) with those offered or provided by any Protected Party.

 

(iii)Except as expressly provided on Schedule I to this Agreement, for a
period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years after the
Effective Time, Director will not (except on behalf of or with the prior
written consent of CenterState), either directly or indirectly, on Director's
own behalf or in the service or on behalf of others, act as a director,
manager, officer or employee of any business which is the same as or
essentially the same as the business conducted by any Protected Party and
which has an office located within the Restricted Territory.

 

(iv)For a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending two (2) years
after the Effective Time, Director will not on Director's own behalf or in the
service or on behalf of others, solicit or recruit or attempt to solicit or
recruit, directly or by assisting others, any employee of any Protected Party,
whether or not such employee is a full-time employee, whether or not such
employment is pursuant to a written agreement, and whether or not such
employment is for a determined period or is at will, to cease working for such
Protected Party; provided that the foregoing will not prevent the placement of
any general solicitation for employment not specifically directed towards
employees of any Protected Party or hiring any such person as a result
thereof.

 

(c)For purposes of this Section 1, the following terms shall be defined as set
forth below:

 

(i)"Competitive," with respect to particular products or services, shall mean
products or services that are the same as or substantially similar to the
products or services of any Protected Party.

 

(ii)"Confidential Information" shall mean data and information:

 

(A)relating to the business of Company and its subsidiaries, including the
Bank, or the business of CenterState or its subsidiaries, including
CenterState Bank, regardless of whether the data or information constitutes a
Trade Secret;

 

(B)disclosed to Director or of which Director became aware as a consequence of
Director's relationship with Company and/or any of the Bank;

  (C)having value to Company and/or any of the Bank and, as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
CenterState and CenterState Bank; and

 

(D)not generally known to competitors of Company or CenterState.

 

Confidential Information shall include Trade Secrets, methods of operation,
names of customers, price lists, financial information and projections,
personnel data and similar information; provided, however, that the terms
"Confidential Information" and "Trade Secrets" shall not mean data or
information that (x) has been disclosed to the public, except where such
public disclosure has been made by Director without authorization from Company
or CenterState, (y) has been independently developed and disclosed by others,
or (z) has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.

 

(iii)"Restricted Territory" shall mean each county in Florida where the Bank
operates a banking office at the Effective Time and each county contiguous to
each of such counties.

 

(iv)"Trade Secret" shall mean information, without regard to form, including
technical or nontechnical data, a formula, a pattern, a compilation, a
program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial
data, financial plans, product plans or a list of actual or potential
customers or suppliers, that is not commonly known by or available to the
public and which information:

 

(A)derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known
to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and

 

(B)is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to
maintain its secrecy.

 

(d)Director acknowledges that irreparable loss and injury would result to
CenterState upon the breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section
1 and that damages arising out of such breach would be difficult to ascertain.
Director hereby agrees that, in addition to all other remedies provided at law
or in equity, CenterState may petition and obtain from a court of law or
equity, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting
any bond or other security, both temporary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent a breach by Director of any covenant contained in this Section 1, and
shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and
other benefits arising out of any such breach. In the event that the
provisions of this Section 1 should ever be determined to exceed the time,
geographic or other limitations permitted by applicable law, then such
provisions shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law. If such provision(s) cannot be modified to be enforceable,
the provision(s) shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent
unenforceable. The remaining provisions and any partially enforceable
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

 

2.Term; Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the
written consent of the parties hereto, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated upon the earlier of (i) termination of the Merger
Agreement; (ii) two (2) years following the Effective Time or (iii) upon a
change in control of CenterState. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of Section 1 shall only become operative upon the consummation of the Merger
but, in such event, shall survive the consummation of the Merger upon the
earlier of two (2) years after the Effective Time or upon a change

  in control of control of CenterState. Upon termination of this Agreement, no
party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder, except that
termination of this Agreement will not relieve a breaching party from
liability for any breach of any provision of this Agreement occurring prior to
the termination of this Agreement.

 

3.Notices. Any notice, consent, demand, request or other communication given
to a party hereto in connection with this Agreement shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given to such party (i) when delivered personally
to such party or (ii) provided that a written acknowledgment of receipt is
obtained, five (5) days after being sent by prepaid certified or registered
mail or (iii) two (2) days after being sent by a nationally recognized
overnight courier, to the address (if any) specified below for such party (or
to such other address as such party shall have specified by ten (10) days'
