## SECTION 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Co, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

  

### (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares,
including any shares issued upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, the "
_Shares_ ") (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.01(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive $38.00 in cash, without interest (the
" _Merger Consideration_ "), payable upon surrender in the manner provided in
Section 2.02 of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share (a "
_Certificate_ ").

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent and Merger Co-Owned
Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company and each share of

       

### Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Co or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Co or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

  

### (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Co_. Each share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of Merger Co issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.  Following the Effective Time, each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Co common stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (d) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with
respect to, or rights issued in respect of, the Shares (other than the
conversion of Convertible Notes into Shares or the issuance of Shares upon
the exercise of Company Stock Options or the vesting of RSUs), the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide
the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. 

  

## SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and (ii) enter into
a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, with such Paying Agent, to serve as the Paying Agent for the payment
of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and payments
in respect of the Company Stock Options and RSUs unless another agent is
designated as provided in Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.04(b). At
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit, with the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Shares, Company Stock Options and RSUs, cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
paid pursuant to Section 2.01(a) plus any cash payable to holders of Company
Stock Options and RSUs pursuant to Section 2.04 (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying
Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to
the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in any event within 4 business days after the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to

       

### Section 2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary
form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates evidencing such Shares shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or
Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate pursuant to
Section 2.01(a), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Certificate representing such
Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II.

  

### (c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company,
except as otherwise provided herein or by Law.

  

### (d) _Exchange Fund for Dissenting Shares_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.02(a) to pay for
Shares that become Dissenting Shares shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand following the filing of a petition for appraisal of
the Shares with the Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for payment of the
Merger Consideration for such Shares held by any stockholder who shall
have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost
such stockholders rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 of
the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ").

  

### (e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

       

### (f) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Co or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

### (g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Merger Co shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under all applicable Tax laws and pay such withholding amount
over to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger
Co, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Merger Co, as the case may be.

  

### (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section
2.01(a).

  

## SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company
other than to settle transfers of Shares that occurred prior the Effective
Time. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be cancelled
against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

  

## SECTION 2.04 _Company Stock Options_. (a) Except as provided for in
Section 2.04(b), each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the
" _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any plan arrangement or agreement,
other than the ESPP (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), which is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or
vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Parent, Merger Co, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into
and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with
respect to each share that such Company Stock Option is then convertible
into, equal to the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price of such Company Stock Option (such amount being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Merger Consideration_ ") and each
Company Stock Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time. The payment of
Option Merger Consideration to the holder of a Company Stock Option shall be
reduced by any income or employment tax withholding required under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such
Company Stock Option. The Company agrees to take any and all actions
necessary to effectuate immediately prior to the Effective Time

       

## the cancellation of all Company Stock Options that are eligible for the
Option Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.04(a). All payments
with respect to Company Stock Options shall be made by the Paying Agent (or
such other agent reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company shall
designate prior to the Effective Time, which may be the Companys payroll
agent) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from
funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay
such amounts in accordance with Section 2.02(a).

  

### (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.04(a) that provide for
the cancellation of the unexercised Company Stock Options, Parent, in its
sole discretion, may permit the holders of certain Company Stock Options (the
" _Rollover Optionees_ ") to exchange some or all of their outstanding
Company Stock Options and receive substituted options to purchase common
stock of Parent on such terms and conditions as are reasonably acceptable to
Parent. Section 2.04(b) of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent and Merger Co concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") sets forth the Rollover
Optionees, which schedule may be amended and revised by Parent prior to the
Closing Date. Parent intends that the exchange and substitution of the
Company Stock Options for new options shall be effected in a manner,
including but not limited to adjustments to the exercise price of the new
options, that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 to the extent that such
requirements can be satisfied in light of the intended terms of the new
options.  Parent and the Company will cooperate to take such actions as
they reasonably agree are necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.04(b).

  

## SECTION 2.05 _Restricted Shares; RSUs_.

  

### (a) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a
holder of Restricted Shares with respect to such holders Restricted Shares,
each award of Restricted Shares which is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of applicable lapse
restrictions as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time, be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.01(a).

  

### (b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by Parent and a
holder of RSUs with respect to such holders RSUs, each award of RSUs which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and
become free of applicable lapse restrictions as of the Effective Time and
shall, as of the Effective Time, be canceled and extinguished, and the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the
product of (A) the number of shares previously subject to such RSU and (B)
the Merger Consideration, and the (ii) the value of any deemed dividend
equivalents accrued but unpaid with respect to such RSUs, less any amounts
required to be withheld under any applicable Law. All payments with respect
to canceled RSUs shall be made by the Paying Agent (or such other agent
reasonably acceptable to Parent as the Company shall designate prior to the
Effective Time, which may be the Companys payroll agent) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at
the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance
with Section 2.02(a).

       

## SECTION 2.06 _Dissenting Shares_. (a)  Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL,
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands
(and does not timely withdraw such demand) the appraisal of such Shares (the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,
the provisions of Section 262 shall not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Any such stockholder shall
instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of
such stockholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Dissenting Shares held by
any stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall
have withdrawn, in accordance with Section 262, or lost such stockholders
rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates that
formerly evidenced such Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.02(b), and
the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for the payment thereof.

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares and withdrawals of such
demands and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except,
in the case of the Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized,

to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each Subsidiary
is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is
in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing), in each

       

## jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or

have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

## SECTION 3.02 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company has

such confidentiality agreements may permit the third party to disclose
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries received thereunder
to debt (but, subject to Section 6.04(b)(B), not equity) financing sources;
and _provided_   _further_ , that the Company shall provide to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the

       

Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access
which was not previously provided to Parent concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person; and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or
negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate
with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, discussions or negotiations.

  

(b) Subject to Sections 6.04(a) and 6.04(c), until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII,
none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of the Company
Representatives shall, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage (including by way of providing information or providing
access to its properties, books, records or personnel) the submission of any
inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that
constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or
otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or participate in, or
knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or
negotiations, (B) modify, waive, amend or release any standstill,
confidentiality or similar agreements entered into by the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof or any confidentiality
agreement entered into by the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
between the date hereof and the Effective Time; _provided_  that the Company
(acting under the direction of the Special Committee) may permit a party to
any confidentiality agreement that the Company was not prohibited from
entering into by the terms of this Section 6.04 to disclose information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries (or provide access to their
properties, books, records or personnel) received under such confidentiality
agreement to specifically identified equity financing sources upon request if
the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that permitting such disclosure would not be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties, (C) neglect to enforce the provisions of any such
standstill, confidentiality or similar agreements, or (D) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent,
agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
providing for or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
breach its obligations hereunder or resolve or authorize or propose or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Subject to Section 6.04(c) and except
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal received prior to the Solicitation
Period End Date with respect to which the requirements of Sections
6.04(c)(i), (ii) and (iii) have been satisfied as of the Solicitation Period
End Date (any such Person so submitting such an Acquisition Proposal, an "
_Excluded Party_ "), as determined, with respect to any Excluded Party, by
the Special Committee no later than the Solicitation Period End Date, on the
Solicitation Period End Date (or, with respect to an Excluded Party, on such
date thereafter that such Excluded Party ceases to be an Excluded Party
pursuant to the last sentence of this Section 6.04(b)), the Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted theretofore by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any Company Representatives with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6.04 to
the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all
purposes under this Agreement at and after such time as the
Acquisition Proposal made by such party fails, in the

       

reasonable judgment of the Special Committee, to satisfy the requirements of
Section 6.04(c)(i), (ii) or (iii).

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.04(b), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Vote, (i) the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach
of Section 6.04(b), that the Company Board (acting through, or based upon the
advice of, the Special Committee if such committee still exists) believes in
good faith to be bona fide, (ii) the Company Board (acting through, or based
upon the advice of, the Special Committee if such committee still exists)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (iii) after
consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board (acting through, or
based upon the advice of, the Special Committee if such committee still
exists) determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the
Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow Company Representatives
to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without entering into
a customary confidentiality agreement on terms no more favorable to such
Person than those contained in a Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that
such confidentiality agreements may permit such Person to disclose
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries (or provide access to
their properties, books, records or personnel) received thereunder to debt
(but, subject to Section 6.04(b)(B), not equity) financing sources, and (y)
will provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or
its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously
provided to Parent concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.04(b) or this
Section 6.04(c), prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the
Company shall be permitted to take the actions described in clauses (A) and
(B) above with respect to any Excluded Party until such time after the
Solicitation Period End Date as such Excluded Party ceases to be an Excluded
Party pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.04(b). From and after the
Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall within 24 hours notify Parent
in the event it receives an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of
related Persons, including the material terms and conditions thereof, and
shall keep Parent apprised as to the status and any material developments,
discussions and negotiations concerning the same on a current basis (and in
any event no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of such developments,
discussions or negotiations). Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall within 24 hours notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal from a Person or group of related Persons
pursuant to this Section 6.04(c). Within 24 hours of the Solicitation Period
End Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number of Excluded Parties
and provide Parent a written summary of the material terms and conditions of
each Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party and, from and
after the Solicitation Period End Date, keep Parent apprised as to the status
and material developments, discussions and negotiations concerning the same
on a current basis (and in any event no later than 24 hours after
the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations).

   

34   

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Vote, the Company receives
an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board (acting through, or based
upon the advice of, the Special Committee if such committee still exists)
concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect
to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause
(ii) below, the Company Board (acting through, or based upon the advice of,
the Special Committee if such committee still exists) may (x) effect a
Recommendation Withdrawal or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal if, in the case
of either the foregoing clauses (x) or (y), the Company Board
(acting through, or based upon the advice of, the Special Committee if such
committee still exists) determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , however that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause
(y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
8.03(a); and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company Board may not effect
a Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless:

  

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Co, at least 72 hours in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention
to effect a Recommendation Withdrawal in response to such Superior Proposal
or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents; and

  

(ii) prior to effecting such Recommendation Withdrawal or terminating this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors
to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Merger Co in good
faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Co desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

  

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger Co and
to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.04(d) with respect to such
new written notice.

  

(e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.04 by any Company Representative shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.04 by the Company.

  

(f) As used in this Agreement, the term:

  

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group (other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to any direct
or indirect acquisition

       

or purchase of 15% or more of the assets, net revenues or net income of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company then outstanding, any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially
owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company then
outstanding, or any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the
Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the assets, net revenues or
net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), other than
as contemplated by this Agreement;

  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in
violation of Section 6.04 that relates to an acquisition of more than 50% of
the outstanding Shares or more than 50% of the assets, net revenues or income
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting through, or based upon the advice of, ****
the Special Committee, if such committee still exists) in good faith
determines, would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
than the transactions contemplated hereby (x) after receiving the advice of
SunTrust, or another nationally recognized financial advisor, (y) after
taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the
terms set forth therein (as compared to the terms herein, as may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 6.04(d)(ii)) and (z) after taking into account all
appropriate legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including
the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory or other aspects of
such proposal.

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange _Act_ ; _provided_ , any such disclosure (other than (i) a "stop,
look and listen" letter or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) a statement that the Company is
unable to take a position with respect to the relevant tender offer (a " _No-
Position Statement_ ") or (iii) a rejection by the Company of the relevant
tender offer) shall be subject to compliance by the Company with Section
6.04(d) and shall be deemed to be a Recommendation Withdrawal; _provided_
that if the Company makes a No-Position Statement and the Company Board does
not expressly publicly reaffirm the Recommendation at least four business
days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, such No-Position Statement
shall be deemed a Recommendation Withdrawal.

  

## SECTION 6.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.
(a)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to the indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and
officers than are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of the Company (or the relevant
Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof. Parent shall and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, and advance expenses to, each present
and former director or officer of the Company and each Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), in and to the extent of their
capacities as such and not as stockholders of the Company or any

       

## Subsidiary, in respect of actions, omissions or events through the
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Law. Without limiting
the generality of the preceding sentence, if any Indemnified Party becomes
involved in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or
investigation covered by this Section 6.05 after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, promptly advance to such Indemnified Party his or her legal
or other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and preparation
incurred in connection therewith). Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all
indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof, true and complete copies of which have
been made available to Parent.

  

### (b) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) cause to be obtained and
shall maintain a "tail" insurance policy with a claims period of at least six
years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in amount and scope, and with other material terms and
conditions, at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies for
claims arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time
or (ii) maintain the existing officers and directors liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company ( _provided_ that the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties) for a period of six years after the Effective Time so
long as the annual premium therefor is not in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date hereof; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that
if the existing officers and directors liability insurance policies expire,
are terminated or cancelled during such six-year period or require an annual
premium in excess of 300% of the current premium paid by the Company for such
insurance, the Company will obtain as much coverage as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess of 300% (on an
annualized basis) of such current premium.

  

### (c) This Section 6.05 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors or officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries, their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason or
(ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity (including by dissolution), then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the transferee
or transferees of such properties and assets, as applicable, shall assume all
of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.  The agreements and
covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other
rights to which any such present or former director or officer is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to, or shall, release, waive or impair any
rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is
or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors and employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
6.05 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under any such
policies.

       

## SECTION 6.06 _Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) Parent hereby agrees that,
for a period of one year after the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide each
employee of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each,
an " _Employee_ "), with (x) base salary and incentive compensation
opportunities (other than equity-based compensation) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (y) employee benefits (other than equity-
based compensation) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the Plans listed on Section 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
taking into account changes pursuant to Section 5.01(g). Nothing herein shall
be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any Employee, or to restrict
the right of the Surviving Corporation to terminate any Employee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein, whether express or
implied, (i) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Employee Plan, or (ii) shall limit the right of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Employee
Plan following the Closing Date. Parent, Merger Co and the
Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section
6.06 with respect to Employees are included for the sole benefit of Parent,
Merger Co and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express or
implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any
other Person, including, without limitation, any Employees, former Employees,
any participant in any Employee Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates or continued participation
in any Employee Plan.

  

### (b) Employees shall receive credit for their services with the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries (including for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits,
but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under
any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries
under which each Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries under comparable Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

  

### (c) With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and arrangements
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (" _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans_ ") in which an active
Employee may become eligible to participate in the one-year period following
the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) waive, or use reasonable best efforts to
cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to preexisting and
at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each active Employee under any Purchaser Welfare
Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under a comparable Plan and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any
Employee and his or her covered dependents under comparable Plans during the
plan year in which such individuals move to a comparable Purchaser Welfare
Benefit Plan to be taken into account under the Purchaser Welfare Benefit
Plans for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her dependents
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the Purchaser Welfare
Benefit Plans.

       

### (d) _Company ESPP_. On and after the date hereof, no future offering
periods will be commenced or options will be granted under the ESPP. The
Company shall terminate the current offering periods and options outstanding
under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement and the Company shall terminate
the ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to matters
described in this Section 6.06(d), any material notices or
other communication materials provided to the ESPPs participants shall be
provided reasonably in advance to Parent and the Company shall take into
consideration in good faith Parents comments that are provided in writing.

  

### (e) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly agreed that the
provisions of Section 9.06 shall apply to this Section 6.06.  From and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to honor and perform, in accordance with their
terms, the Plans listed on Schedule 6.06(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

  

## SECTION 6.07 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable
Laws and the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of the Company
and Parent shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its
Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall promptly notify
each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of
any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied, (ii) the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of
any party to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied or (iii) any communication received (A)
from any Person alleging a consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and _provided_ _further_ that
any failure to provide notice pursuant to this Section 6.07 shall not be
deemed to be a breach of this Agreement for purposes of Sections 7.02(b) or
7.03(b) hereof.

  

## SECTION 6.08 _Financing_. (a)  Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period and the Expiration Date
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters (
_provided_ that Parent may replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letters so
long as the terms (x) shall not expand upon the conditions precedent to the
Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters in any respect or
(y) would not adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Co to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or reasonably be
expected

       

## to delay the Closing; and _provided_   _further_ , that in the event of
any such amendment or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letters in
accordance with the foregoing, the term "Debt Commitment Letters" as used
herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters as so amended
or replaced, and the term "Financing Commitment" as used herein shall be
deemed to include the Equity Funding Letters and the revised Debt Commitment
Letters), including using reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely
basis all terms, conditions, representations and warranties applicable to
Parent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters; (ii) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect thereto on substantially the terms
and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or on other terms
acceptable to Parent ( _provided_ that such other terms (x) shall not expand
upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters in any respect or (y) would not adversely affect the
ability of Parent or Merger Co to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or reasonably be expected to delay the Closing); and (iii) enforce its
rights under the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent will furnish correct and
complete copies of all such definitive agreements (including any fee letters
but redacting any confidential terms contained therein) to the Company
promptly upon their execution. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources (on terms and conditions no
less favorable to Parent with respect to conditions precedent to the Debt
Financing (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms
and conditions as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters) in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event giving rise to
such unavailability, but in any event no later than five calendar days
after the final day of the Marketing Period.  Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Marketing Period_ " shall mean the first period of 20 consecutive business
days after the date hereof throughout which (A) Parent shall have the
Required Financial Information (as defined below) that the Company is
required to provide to Parent pursuant to Section 6.08(c), (B) the Company
has made the Required Filings (as defined below) and (C) the conditions set
forth in Section 7.01 shall be satisfied and nothing has occurred and
no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.02(a), 7.02(b) or 7.02(d) to fail to be satisfied assuming the
Closing were to be scheduled for any time during such 20 consecutive business
day period; _provided_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or
prior to December 15, 2006, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier
than January 2, 2007; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the "Marketing
Period" shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to the completion of
the Marketing Period, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall have withdrawn its
audit opinion with respect to any financial statements contained in the SEC
Reports.

  

### (b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause the Subsidiaries and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives to
provide, such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing (including, without limitation, the issuance of senior notes and/or
senior subordinated notes contemplated by the Commitment Letters) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company
and the Subsidiaries), including without limitation (i) participation in
meetings, road shows, drafting

       

### sessions, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions
customary and necessary for the consummation of the Debt Financing on the
terms described in the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) (A) furnishing Parent
and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be customary for transactions of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and reasonably requested by
Parent, including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K and of type and form
customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act to consummate the offering of secured or unsecured senior or
senior subordinated notes (the " _Required Financial Information_ ") and (B)
filing such reports under the securities laws as may be customary
for transactions of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
and reasonably requested by Parent (the " _Required Filings_ "); _provided_
 that the Company shall not be required to file any projections pursuant to
this Section 6.08, (iii) assisting Parent and its financing sources in
the preparation of (A) offering documents for any portion of the Debt
Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and its financing sources for any of the
Debt Financing, (v) providing and executing customary closing documents as
may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of the chief
financial officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters, (vi)
executing and delivering any pledge and security documents and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral, and (vii) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing, accountants comfort letters, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance customary for transactions of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and as reasonably requested by
Parent. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Except to the extent
disclosed to potential investors and lenders in connection with the Debt
Financing, all non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent, Merger Co or their Representatives pursuant to
this Section 6.08(b) shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreements.

  

## SECTION 6.09 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  

(g) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
**** to file, or cause to be filed, all documents and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing
as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations, permits or orders from all
Governmental Authorities or other Persons. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof and to make, or cause to be made, the filings and
authorizations, if any, required under the Other Antitrust Laws of
jurisdictions other than the United States as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be

### (c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this
Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation".  Unless
otherwise specified, the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole (including the Company Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits) and not
any particular

     

   

### provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms. Unless otherwise expressly defined,
terms defined in this Agreement have the same meanings when used in any
Exhibit or Schedule hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule.
References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.
 Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. The word "extent" in
the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". References to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

  

## SECTION 9.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

## SECTION 9.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the
Guarantees and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire agreement
among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. No party may assign, delegate or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
consent of the other parties hereto (and any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void and without effect), except that each of Parent
and Merger Co may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder
to any Affiliate of Parent or, after the Closing, in connection with a
merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

  

## SECTION 9.06 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.05 (which is intended to be
for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by
such Persons).

  

## SECTION 9.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware (without
giving effect to the choice of law principles therein).

  

## SECTION 9.08 _Specific Performance; Submission to Jurisdiction_.  (a) The
Company agrees that to the extent it has incurred losses or damages in
connection with this Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate liability of Parent
and Merger Co for such losses or

     

   

## damages shall be limited to $30,000,000, (ii) the maximum liability of the
Guarantors, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the express
obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees, and (iii) in no event
shall the Company seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount
from Parent, Merger Co or the Guarantors or any of their respective
stockholders, partners, members, affiliates, directors, officers, employees
or agents in connection therewith.

  

### (b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
 It is accordingly agreed that Parent and Merger Co shall, prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in Court of
Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity, subject
to the limitations in paragraph (a) of this Section 9.08. The parties
acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Co or
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and that
the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such breach shall
be the remedy set forth in Section 8.03(d) and Section 9.08(a); _provided_
that the Company shall be entitled to specific performance against Parent and
Merger Co to prevent any breach by Parent or Merger Co of Section 6.03(b) and
the last sentence of Section 6.08(b).

  

### (c) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or other courts of the State
of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery or other courts
of the State of Delaware and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in
Section 9.02.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.02 shall
be effective service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

## SECTION 9.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may
have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger.
Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that
such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Merger, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.09.

  

## SECTION 9.10 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in
this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

     

   

## SECTION 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
