ARTICLE I

 



 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 



 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (including
Article VII), as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
but in any event no later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the date of
this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer.
The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment, and pay for, any shares of Common Stock validly tendered pursuant
to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted under this Agreement) of the conditions set forth in Annex I (as
they may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer
Conditions_ ").

 



 

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, Parent and Merger Sub reserve the right,
at any time, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition (other than
the Minimum Condition), to increase the Offer Price or to modify the terms of
the Offer, in each case only in a manner not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the
maximum number of shares of Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer,
(ii) reduce the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) impose
conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to the Offer
Conditions, (v) modify or amend any existing Offer Condition in a manner that
is adverse to the holders of Common Stock or that would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or impair the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, (vi) except as otherwise required or
expressly permitted by Section 1.1(d) extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Time, (vii) provide for any "subsequent offering period" within the
meaning of Rule

 



       
 

 



 

14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (viii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement
the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Common Stock or in any
manner that delays or unreasonably interferes with, hinders or impairs the
consummation of the Offer. Subject to Section 1.1(g), the Offer may not be
terminated prior to its scheduled Expiration Time, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article VII.

 



 

(c) The Offer shall initially expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
date that is twenty-one (21) Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer
(such initial expiration date and time of the Offer, the " _Initial Expiration
Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 1.1(d), the date and time to which the Offer has been so extended (the
Initial Expiration Time, or such later expiration date and time to which the
Offer has been so extended, the " _Expiration Time_ ").

 



 

(d) Subject to Article VII, Merger Sub may or shall, as applicable, extend the
Offer from time to time as follows:

 



 

(i) for the period as required by any applicable Law, including any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or the
Applicable Exchange;

 



 

(ii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Company brings or shall
have brought any Legal Action in accordance with Section 8.15 to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub, the Expiration Time shall be extended (A) for the period
during which such action is pending or (B) by such other time period
established by the Governmental Authority presiding over such action, as the
case may be, but, in each case of clauses (A) and (B), not past the
Termination Date (for the avoidance of doubt, as the Termination Date may be
extended pursuant to Section 7.2(a));

 



 

(iii) subject to Section 7.7(a), if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time,
any of the Offer Conditions has not either been (A) satisfied or (B) waived by
Parent and Merger Sub (to the extent such waiver is permitted under this
Agreement and applicable Law), then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive
periods of five (5) Business Days each (with each such period to end at 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of such period) (or such
other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company) in order to
permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date later than
the Termination Date (for the avoidance of doubt, as the Termination Date may
be extended pursuant to Section 7.2(a)) unless Parent or Merger Sub is not
then permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(a), in
which case Merger Sub shall be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Termination Date; or

 



 

(iv) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, (A) the full amount of the
Debt Financing has not been funded and will not be available to be funded at
the Offer Closing and the Closing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
and

 



      
 

 



 

agree in writing that, if all Offer Conditions had been satisfied at the then
scheduled Expiration Time, the Company would have been entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(e) and receive the Parent Termination
Fee, Merger Sub shall have the right in its sole discretion to extend the
Offer on up to three occasions in consecutive increments of five (5) Business
Days each (with each such period to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the last Business Day of such period) (or such other duration as may be agreed
to by Parent and the Company); _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be
permitted to extend the Offer to a date later than the Termination Date (for
the avoidance of doubt, as the Termination Date may be extended pursuant to
Section 7.2(a)).

 



 

Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer in any manner except as required or permitted pursuant to this Section
1.1(d).

 



 

(e) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, including
satisfaction or waiver of all of the Offer Conditions, (i) prior to 9:00 a.m.,
New York City time, on the Business Day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) immediately following the Expiration Time, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for payment
(the time of acceptance for payment, the " _Offer Acceptance Time_ ") all
shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer and (ii) at or as promptly as practicable following the Offer
Acceptance Time (but in any event within three (3) Business Days (calculated
as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) thereafter) Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, pay for all shares of Common
Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer;
_provided_ , that with respect to shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement
or satisfaction of such guarantee, Merger Sub shall be under no obligation to
make any payment for such shares unless and until such shares are delivered in
settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee. Parent shall provide or cause to
be provided to Merger Sub, at the Offer Acceptance Time, the funds that, when
taken together with available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are
necessary to purchase any shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to
fulfill all of Merger Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Common Stock shall be
paid on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. The Company
agrees that no shares of Common Stock held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(g) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VII,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior to
any scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of the Company
in its sole discretion. In the event this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article VII, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) following such termination irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any shares of Common
Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer or this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with this Agreement, Merger Sub shall promptly return, or cause any
depositary acting on behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub to promptly return, all tendered shares to the tendering
stockholders in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Subject to the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Section 5.1, the Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and
proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement
and at or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and such adjustment to the Offer
Price shall provide to the holders of shares of Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

 



 

(i) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_"), which shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and other appropriate ancillary
offer documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant
to which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the holders of the Common Stock as and to the extent required
by United States federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish
or otherwise make available to Parent or Parents legal counsel upon request
all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that may be
reasonably requested by Parent for inclusion in the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary and use all reasonable efforts to promptly amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
the Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Law. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before
any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
include in such document (and any amendments thereto) all comments proposed by
the Company and its counsel and acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub and their
counsel, in each case acting reasonably. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide
the Company and its counsel with (A) any comments or other communications,
whether written or oral, that Parent or Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff or other Governmental
Authorities with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of those comments or other communications and (B) a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (which response shall
include all comments proposed by the Company and its counsel and acceptable to
Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel, in each case acting reasonably),
including by offering the Company an opportunity to participate with Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel in any material discussions or meetings with the
SEC or other Governmental Authorities to the extent such participation is not
prohibited by

 



      
 

 



 

the SEC or other Governmental Authorities. In the event that Parent or Merger
Sub receives any comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents, each shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable to such comments.

(a) On the date the Offer is commenced and the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company shall, concurrently with the filing of the Schedule TO,
file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") containing,
subject to Section 5.4, the Company Board Recommendation and shall disseminate
the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders of the Common Stock as and to the extent
required by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also
contain the notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by the Company
under Section 262 of the DGCL at the time the Company first files the Schedule
14D-9 with the SEC. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available to the Company or the Companys legal counsel upon
request all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be
reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary and use all reasonable efforts to promptly amend or supplement the
Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of the Common Stock,
in each case as soon as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time before it is filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall include in such document (and any amendments thereto)
all comments proposed by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel and acceptable
to the Company and its counsel, in each case acting reasonably. The Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff or other Governmental
Authorities with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (which response shall include all comments proposed
by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel and acceptable to the Company and its
counsel, in each case acting reasonably), including by offering Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel an opportunity to participate with the Company or its
counsel in any material discussions or meetings with the SEC or other
Governmental Authorities to the extent such participation is not prohibited by
the SEC or other Governmental Authorities. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation contained
in the Schedule 14D-9. In the event that the Company receives any comments
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to such
comments.

 



 

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall furnish, or shall cause
its transfer agent to furnish, Parent and Merger Sub promptly (and in any
event within five

 



      
 

 



 

(5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement) with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Common Stock as of
the latest practicable date and shall promptly furnish, or cause to be
furnished, mailing labels containing such information of those Persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all
other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of Common Stock, in each case as of the latest date
practicable, and shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives such information (including periodically updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as they may
reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Merger Transactions, Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives shall use the information contained in any such
labels, listings and files only in connection with the Merger Transactions,
shall treat such information and materials in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated in accordance with Article VII, will use their reasonable best
efforts to deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information
then in their possession or under their control promptly upon the request of
the Company. The Company and Parent shall coordinate the mailing of the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 so they can be included together in a joint
mailing to the holders of Common Stock.

 



 

Section 1.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL (including Section
251(h) thereof), at the Effective Time, (a) Merger Sub shall be merged with

cease and the Company shall continue its corporate existence under the DGCL as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and (c)
the Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

Section 1.4 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to closing contained in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied), the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable following the consummation
(as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the Offer (the "Offer Closing"),
but in any event no later than the date of, and immediately following, the
payment for the shares of Common Stock tendered in the Offer, at the offices
of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153 at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, or at such other place and time as Parent and
the Company may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to as the "Closing Date".

the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") to be executed, signed, acknowledged and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in such form as is required by
the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other deliveries,
filings or recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other
subsequent date or time as Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

the Company may agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in accordance
with the DGCL (the "Effective Time").

 



 

Section 1.6 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. The Merger shall be
governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, without a vote of
the stockholders of the Company. The parties agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as

of the DGCL) of the Offer, without a vote of the stockholders of the Company
in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 1.7 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger.

the form of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that (a) all references to the

Sub therein may be changed to refer to the name, date of incorporation,
registered office and registered agent, respectively, of the Company and (b)

automatically, be extinguished and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be paid for those Excluded Shares.

 



 

(c) Conversion of Common Stock.

 



 

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the

holders thereof, without interest, in accordance with Section 2.2.

 



 

(ii) All shares of Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c)(i) shall be canceled automatically and shall be extinguished and cease
to exist, and the holders of (A) certificates which immediately before the
Effective Time represented such shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares
represented by book-entry immediately before the Effective Time (the " _Book-
Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect to those shares,
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.2 and (subject to Section 5.1) any dividends or other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized
by the Company and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) Each share of Common Stock owned by any of the direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company shall be automatically converted into

pursuant to Section 1.1(h) to reflect such change.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days before the Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable
to the Company, to act as agent for the stockholders to receive the Merger
Consideration to which they shall have become entitled to pursuant to Section

agreement with the Paying Agent in customary form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The Company shall be responsible for all Expenses of the Paying
Agent.

 



 

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares, for payment in accordance with
this Article II through the Paying Agent, sufficient funds for the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration and other amounts payable under Article II.
Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_."

 



 

(c) Payment Procedures.

 



 

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, but no later than five (5) Business Days following the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a share of Common Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(i) (A)
a letter of transmittal in customary form, specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to such holders shares shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal and (B) instructions for surrendering such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of that Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay in exchange
therefor, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the number of shares
formerly evidenced by that Certificate or such Book-Entry Share less any
required withholding of Taxes. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be canceled immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid
on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid
and issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, then the Merger Consideration
may be paid or issued to such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, as applicable, shall be properly endorsed and
presented to the Paying Agent or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and is accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence
and effect such

 



      
 

 



 

transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment or issuance (x) pays any
applicable transfer Taxes or (y) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent and the Paying Agent that all such transfer Taxes have already been
paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section
2.2(c), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share in respect of shares of
Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.1(c)(i) shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, subject to the
Surviving Corporations obligation (subject to Section 5.1) to pay any
dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective
Time which may have been authorized by the Company and which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid and issued upon the
surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid and issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
and, in the case of a Certificate, the shares of Common Stock formerly
represented by it.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation (including if requested by
the Paying Agent), the execution and delivery by such Person of a customary
indemnity agreement to provide indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the
Merger Consideration to such Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

 



 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration and any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement
(including any amounts payable under Section 2.3 with respect to the
cancellation of Company Equity Awards) such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was
made for all purposes under this Agreement. Upon becoming aware of any such
withholding obligation (other than in connection with any amounts payable
under Section 2.3), Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall provide commercially reasonable notice
to the Person with respect to which such withholding obligation applies, and
shall reasonably cooperate with such Person to obtain any available reduction
of or relief from such deduction or withholding.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
any amount

 



      
 

 



 

properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the
risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent
shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of such holders
of Common Stock in the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary to
satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under Section
2.1(c)(i) and Section 2.2.

 



 

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent
upon demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not complied with this Article II shall look only to Parent, which shall
remain responsible for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
Parent or its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or
vested, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder of that Company Option, shall be canceled,
extinguished and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation promptly following the Effective Time an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Option Consideration (as defined below)
multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any
such Company Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled for no consideration.
" _Option Consideration_ " means the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of the applicable Company
Option.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that
Company Restricted Share,

 



       
 

 



 

shall be vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse in full as of
immediately before the Effective Time; and each such Company Restricted Share
shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal in value to
the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company RSU, shall be
vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse in full as of immediately
before the Effective Time; and each such Company RSU shall be canceled and
converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation
an amount in cash, without interest, equal in value to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
subject to such Company RSU immediately before the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company PSU, shall be
vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse for such Company PSU as of
immediately before the Effective Time; and each such Company PSU shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal in value to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
subject for such Company PSU immediately before the Effective Time (assuming
performance had been achieved at the greater of Target Level and actual
performance measured through the Effective Time).

 



 

(e) The payment of the amounts set forth in Section 2.3(a), Section 2.3(b),
Section 2.3(c) and Section 2.3(d) in respect of the Company Equity Awards
shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding required under
the Code or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
any amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder
of that Company Equity Award for all purposes under this Agreement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts so that all Company Equity
Awards shall be canceled and all Company Equity Plans shall terminate at the
Effective Time.

 



 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall, at all times from and after the Effective
Time, maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders
of Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Section 2.3.

 



 

(g) On the next scheduled payroll distribution date (consistent with the
Companys past practice) following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the

holder of a Company Option, in such amount due and payable to such holder
pursuant to Section 2.3(a) in respect of such Company Option, (ii) to each
applicable holder of a Company Restricted Share, in such amount due and
payable to such holder pursuant to Section 2.3(b) in respect of such Company
Restricted Share, (iii) to each applicable holder of a Company RSU, in such

holder pursuant to Section 2.3(d) in respect of such Company PSU.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary (but
subject to the other provisions of this Section 2.4), any shares of Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and for which the holder thereof is entitled to demand and properly demands
the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and complies in all respects
with, the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.1(c). At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be
canceled, extinguished and cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under
the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, in each case, in accordance with Section 2.2.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within one
(1) Business Day) of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Common
Stock, any withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instrument served on the Company relating to stockholders appraisal rights.
Parent shall have the right to direct and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands, withdrawals or attempted withdrawals
of such demands and any other actions with respect of stockholders rights for
appraisal. The Company shall not offer to make or make any payment with
respect to any such demands for appraisal, or compromise or settle or offer to
compromise or settle, any such demands for appraisal, or approve any
withdrawal of such demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262
of the DGCL, or commit or agree to do any of the foregoing, without the prior
written consent of Parent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, or compromise or
settle or offer to compromise or settle, any such demands for appraisal or
commit or agree to do any of the foregoing.

this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions do not and will not (a) contravene or conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the
organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub and (b) assuming that all
Governmental Authorizations described in Section 4.4 have been obtained or
made prior to the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as applicable,
(i) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any assets of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries ("Parent Assets") are

 



      
 

 



 

bound or (ii) result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a default
under, or result in the loss of a benefit or require a consent under, or give
rise to any right by any party to terminate, cancel, accelerate or adversely
modify, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Parent Asset pursuant to,
any Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any Parent Assets are bound, other than in the case of clause (b) of this
Section 4.5, as would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.6 _Capitalization; Interim Operations of Merger Sub; Ownership of
Common Stock_.

 



 

(a) All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at
the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has no outstanding
option, warrant, right or any other agreement pursuant to which any Person
other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub.

 



 

(b) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Transactions and has not engaged, nor prior to the Effective Time will it
engage, in any business activities or operations other than in connection with
the Transactions. Merger Sub has no Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates, is
or has been during the past three (3) years an "interested stockholder" of the
Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor
any of their respective Affiliates beneficially owns, directly or indirectly,
or is the record holder of (or during the past three (3) years has
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, or been the record holder of), and
is not (and during the past three (3) years has not been) a party to any
agreement (other than this Agreement), arrangement or understanding for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, any
shares of Common Stock or any option, warrant or other right to acquire any
shares of Common Stock.

 



 

Section 4.7 _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete
copies of (a) a fully executed commitment letter dated on or about the date of
this Agreement (together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets
attached thereto and as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended
from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section
5.10, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ") from the Sponsor providing for an
equity investment in Parent, subject to the terms and conditions therein, in
cash in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ ")
and (b) a fully executed commitment letter and fee letter (other than any
information to be redacted pursuant to the terms thereof) dated on or about
the date of this Agreement from the financial institutions identified therein
(together with all exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets attached
thereto and as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time
to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section 5.10,
collectively, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " and, together with the Equity
Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Letters_ "), providing, subject to the
terms and conditions therein, for debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing" and, together
with the Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ ").
As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Letters has been
amended or modified, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such amendment or
modification is

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated, and none of the respective obligations and commitments contained
in such letters have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, termination or rescission
is contemplated. Assuming (i) the Financing is funded in accordance with the
Financing Letters and (ii) the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, the net
proceeds contemplated by the Financing Letters (after netting out applicable
Expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and charges and after
giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount
flex) provided under the Debt Commitment Letter), will in the aggregate be
sufficient for Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay the aggregate
Offer Price and Merger Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Debt
Commitment Letter) and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions (including all amounts payable in
respect of Company Equity Awards under this Agreement) and to pay all related
Expenses payable on the Closing Date by them in connection with the
Transactions (such amount collectively, the " _Required Amount_ "). As of the
date of this Agreement, the Financing Letters are (x) legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, each of the other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms against Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, in each case
subject to the Enforceability Exceptions and (z) in full force and effect. As
of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other parties thereto under the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Debt Commitment Letter. Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that the conditions precedent set
forth in the Financing Letters will not be satisfied or that the Required
Amount will not be available on the Closing Date. The only conditions
precedent (including the market "flex" provisions) related to the obligations
of the Guarantor to fund the full amount of the Equity Financing and the
lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter,
respectively. There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements
(except for a customary fee letter, fee credit letter and engagement letter)
to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Financing
other than as expressly contained in the Financing Letters delivered to the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement that would (A) impair the
enforceability of any of the Financing Letters, (B) reduce the aggregate
amount of any portion of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount as compared to the fees and
original issue discount contemplated by the Financing Letters on the date of
this Agreement) such that the aggregate amount of the Financing would be below
the amount required to pay the Required Amount, (C) impose new or additional
conditions precedent to the Financing, (D) otherwise adversely modify any of
the conditions precedent to the Financing or (E) reasonably be expected to
prevent, impair or delay the consummation of the Financing.

 



 

Section 4.8 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Assuming (a)
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger and after giving

 



      
 

 



 

effect to the Transactions and the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and
Merger Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
in this Agreement or the Financing Letters and payment of the Required Amount
and (b) the representations and warranties of the Company in Article III are
accurate, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will be Solvent as of the Offer Acceptance Time and as of the Effective
Time and immediately after the consummation of the applicable Transactions.

 



 

Section 4.9 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof there are no Legal Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of
its Affiliates that would have or reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there are no Orders
outstanding against Parent or any of its Affiliates that would have or
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.10 _Absence of Arrangements with Management and Principal
Stockholders_. Other than this Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no
contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or obligations or
understandings (a) between Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the
Company Board or any of their respective Affiliates or any beneficial owner of
Common Stock, on the other hand, relating to the Transactions or the
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (b) pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive value or
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Offer Price or the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company
agrees to tender any shares of Common Stock in the Offer or agrees to vote
against or otherwise oppose any Superior Proposal.

 



 

Section 4.11 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, except for Persons, if any, whose Expenses will be
paid by Parent.

 



 

Section 4.12 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) will, at the time the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC or at the time the Schedule 14D-9
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) is first published, sent or given to
the stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not false or misleading. The Offer Documents (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and will not, at the time filed with the
SEC and at the time first published, sent or given to the stockholders of the
Company, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
make no representation or

 



       
 

 



 

warranty with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein
based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company or any Affiliates
thereof for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.

 



 

Section 4.13 _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and
Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business and strategic plan information, regarding the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations. Parent
and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business and strategic plans, with
which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans), and that Parent and
Merger Sub have not relied on such information and will have no claim against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, with respect thereto or any rights hereunder with respect
thereto, except pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement, including on
account of a breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements expressly set forth herein (subject to the provisions of Section
7.5 and Section 7.6).

 



 

Section 4.14 _No Other Company Representations and Warranties; Independent
Investigation_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges that it and its
Representatives have received access to such books and records, facilities,
equipment, Contracts and other assets of the Company which it and its
Representatives have desired or requested to review, and that it and its
Representatives have had the opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article III, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any other Person, (a) has made or is making any other
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including
with respect to any information provided or made available to Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Representatives or any information developed by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives or (b) will have
been or be subject to any Liability or indemnification obligation to Parent or
Merger Sub resulting from the delivery, dissemination or any other
distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives,
or the use by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives,
of any information, documents, estimates, projections, forecasts or other
forward-looking information, business plans or other material developed by or
provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives, including in due diligence materials, "data rooms" or
management presentations (formal or informal), in anticipation or
contemplation of any of the Transactions. Parent, on behalf of itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates, expressly waives any such claim relating to the
foregoing matters. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives) that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own
independent investigation of the business, operations, assets and financial
condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries and, in making its determination
to proceed with the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives have relied on the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in Article III and on the results of their
own independent investigation. This Section 4.14 shall not waive any claim or
rights of Parent or Merger Sub or their Affiliates in any case of any fraud by
the Company or any of its Affiliates.

reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company
or its applicable Subsidiary and in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal business or operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would,
in the Companys reasonable discretion (A) jeopardize any attorney-client or

reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose
such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto) or (B) contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (including any

herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Transactions in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or otherwise
prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parents or Merger Subs reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements made by the Company in
this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Information disclosed under this Section 5.3 and otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement shall be governed under the letter agreement regarding
confidentiality, dated September 2, 2016, as amended on February 13, 2017,
between American Securities LLC and the Company (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of information by
Parent or any of its Representatives to the Lender Related Parties pursuant to
Section 5.11 or otherwise shall not require the prior written approval of the
Company pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers and directors

discussions or negotiations with any Persons with respect to a Takeover
Proposal that existed on or prior to the date hereof and (ii) from and after

modification thereto is first made public, sent or given to the stockholders

recommend, or allow the Company or any Subsidiary to enter into, any Contract,

_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.4(d), in
response to a written Takeover Proposal received by the Company Board after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.4 and that the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
the Company Board may, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in
accordance with Section 7.4(a), or authorize, resolve, agree or propose
publicly to take any such action, only if all of the following conditions are
met:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the
Person or group making the Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to
the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or any other material term or condition of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice and a new four (4) Business Day period)
and (3) that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Company Board has determined
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.4(a) in order to enter into the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior to making such an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.4(a), as applicable, to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent, and cause its Representatives to engage in
good faith negotiations with Parents Representatives, during such notice
period to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative
Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms
proposed by Parent, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to
so terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.4(a), as applicable,
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.4(d), upon
the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any time
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, or
authorize, resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, only if
all of the following conditions are met:

 



 

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days
prior written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail
information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii)
below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change, to the
extent requested by

 



      
 

 



 

Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations, and cause its Representatives to
engage in good faith negotiations with Parents Representatives, with Parent
during such five (5) Business Day period to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the failure of the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii)
below would no longer be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and
taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company any position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop,
look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law, after
consulting with outside legal counsel; _provided_ , that this Section 5.4(g)
shall not be deemed to permit the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise permitted by this Section
5.4.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than one year following the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates to, provide to each
individual who, immediately prior to the Effective Time is an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Employee_ ") (i) a salary or
hourly wage rate that is not less than that provided to such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) incentive pay opportunities,
including bonus and commission opportunities, but not including equity and
equity-based awards that are no less favorable than those provided to such
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) other compensation
and employee benefits (excluding equity and equity-based awards which will
remain discretionary) that are no less favorable in the aggregate, determined
on an individual basis, than those provided to such Employee under the
compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time. This Section 5.5(a) shall not apply to Employees whose
terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining or
similar agreement, in which case the terms of the applicable collective
bargaining or similar agreement shall apply.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans (including all
severance, change of control and similar plans and agreements, including the
arrangements set forth on Section 5.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be

 



       
 

 



 

permitted by such Company Benefit Plans and except as provided herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the later of the duration of the
Continuation Period or the remaining term of any individual employment,
severance or separation agreement in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates to, provide each Employee who suffers a termination of
employment under circumstances that would have given the Employee a right to
severance payments and benefits under the Companys or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries severance policy or individual employment, severance or
separation agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a " _Company Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments
and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to
such Employee under any Company Severance Plan.

 



 

(c) For all purposes under all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Affiliates providing benefits to any Employee
after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Employee shall receive
full credit for such Employees years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired
entities or any other entities for which the Company and its Subsidiaries have
given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such Employee was
entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, where
applicable, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at the
Effective Time, each Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was
satisfied under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each
New Plan to be waived or satisfied for such Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as
of the Effective Time and (iii) Parent shall cause all eligible expenses
incurred by each Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(d) With respect to any earned but unused vacation or other paid time off to
which any Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation or other paid time off
policy or individual agreement or other arrangement applicable to such
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Vacation/PTO Policy_
"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates to, (i) allow such Employee to use such earned vacation
or other paid time off in accordance with the Vacation/PTO Policy and (ii) if
any Employees employment terminates during the Continuation Period under
circumstances entitling the Employee to severance pay under the Company
Severance Plan, pay the Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the
earned vacation or other paid time off.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.5, whether express or implied, shall confer upon
any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, any rights or remedies
including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Section
5.5. No provision of this Section 5.5 is intended to modify, amend or create
any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, in accordance with the
Company Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof, (i) indemnify
and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company
(each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with
respect to Damages (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and
Expenses (including those of legal counsel) in connection with any Legal
Action (including as may be administrative or investigative), whenever
asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that
an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or was acting in such capacity, or (B) acts or omissions by an
Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or taken at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including in connection with serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a representative of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under
clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including
any Legal Action (including as may be administrative or investigative)
relating in whole or in part to the Transactions or relating to the
enforcement of this provision) and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company
and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any
agreement in existence as of the date of this Agreement, as specified in
Section 5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, providing for indemnification
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall
cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this
Agreement in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.

 



 

(b) In the event of any Legal Action (including as may be administrative or
investigative) related to the acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.6
(each, a " _Claim_ ") (i) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the
Indemnitee and its insurer in the defense of any such Claim and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Claim pending or threatened in

 



      
 

 



 

writing to which an Indemnitee is a party (and in respect of which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnitee hereunder), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnitee from all Liability arising out of such Claim or the Indemnitee
otherwise consents.

 



 

(c) Parent shall obtain, or cause to be obtained, as of the Effective Time, a
"tail" insurance policy with a claims period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time with respect to directors and officers Liability insurance
covering those Persons who are currently (and any additional Persons who prior
to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and
officers Liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms and scope with respect to such coverage,
and in amount, no less favorable to such Persons than those of such policy in
effect on the date of this Agreement, which insurance shall, prior to the
Effective Time, be in effect and prepaid for such six (6)-year period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in no event shall the total cost for such
prepaid "tail" insurance policy exceed 250% of the annual premium paid as of
the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ "), and
if the total cost for such prepaid "tail" policy exceeds the Premium Cap, then
Parent may obtain, or cause to be obtained, a prepaid "tail" policy with the
maximum coverage available for a total cost of the Premium Cap. If Parent for
any reason fails to obtain or cause to be obtained such "tail" insurance
policy as of the Effective Time, Parent shall continue, or cause to be
continued, to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the directors and officers Liability insurance
in place as of the date of this Agreement with the Companys current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current directors and officers Liability insurance carrier.

 



 

(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnitees and their
respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed exclusive
of, or in substitution for, any other rights to which an Indemnitee is
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.6 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.6 applies unless (x) such termination or
modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.6 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6).

 



 

(e) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action so that
the successors or assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any

 



      
 

 



 

policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this Section 5.6 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims
under such policies.

 



 

(g) Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section
5.6 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Claim (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an
Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.6 shall continue in effect until the full and
final resolution of such Claim.

provisions) set forth in the Financing Letters, including using reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply with the Financing Letters,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions (including the
market "flex" provisions) set forth in the Financing Letters (or on other

upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligations to consummate the Offer and the Merger, draw the Financing in the
amount required to consummate the Transactions on the Closing Date. Parent and
Merger Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree
to or permit any termination of or amendment, supplement or modification to be
made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing Letters if
such termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver would (A)
reduce the aggregate amount of any portion of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount as
compared to the fees and original issue discount contemplated by the Financing
Letters on the date of this Agreement unless the Debt Financing or Equity
Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) such that the aggregate
amount of the Financing would reasonably be expected to be below the amount
required to pay the Required Amount, (B) impose new or additional conditions
precedent to the availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions precedent to the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede or delay the funding of
the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) giving
effect to the Marketing Period or (C) adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to
the Financing Letters; _provided_ , that Parent or Merger Sub may, without the
consent of the Company, amend or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter on the date of this
Agreement. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any
amendment, modification, supplement, consent or waiver to or under any
Financing Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing
promptly upon execution thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Upon request by the Company, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a

to arrange the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt
notice of (i) any breach, default, termination, cancellation or repudiation by
any party to any of the Financing Letters, (ii) the receipt by Parent or
Merger Sub of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing source with respect to any (A) breach, default, termination,
cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Letters or
(B) dispute or disagreement between Parent and any Financing source or among
any parties to any of the Financing Letters, in each case, that could
reasonably be expected to delay the Offer Closing or the Closing, and (iii)
the occurrence of an event or development that could reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Amount on the terms
and in the manner contemplated by the Financing Letters. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within three (3) Business Days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating
to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence. If any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any applicable market "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing and
Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain, reasonably promptly given the anticipated timing of Closing, in
replacement thereof alternative financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in
an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount with terms and conditions
(including market "flex" provisions) not less favorable to Parent and Merger
Sub (or their respective Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of the
alternative debt commitment letters (including fee letters that shall be
redacted pursuant to the terms thereof) pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. For
purposes of this Agreement, references to (x) the " _Financing_ " shall
include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 5.11, (y)
references to the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section

financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as permitted to be
amended, modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 5.11.

reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the debt financings of the type
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable
best efforts to:

Information no longer being Compliant;

 



 

(iii) causing senior management of the Company to assist in preparation for
and participate in a reasonable number of investor and lender meetings

locations mutually agreed, and assist Parent in obtaining ratings in
connection with the Debt Financing;

requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing;

 



 

(v) solely with respect to financial information and data derived from the
Companys historical books and records, assist Parent with the preparation of
pro forma financial information and pro forma financial statements to the
extent it would be required by SEC rules and regulations for a registered
offering of debt securities on Form S-1 or necessary or reasonably required by
Parent or the financing sources providing the Debt Financing, including with
respect to providing the estimated impact of the application of acquisition
accounting in accordance with GAAP to the Companys historical financial
statements together with related footnote disclosures and providing supporting
information to the Companys independent auditors to enable such auditors to
provide customary negative assurance comfort on such pro forma financial
statements, it being agreed that the Company will not be required to provide
any information or assistance relating to (A) the proposed aggregate amount of

any) and fees and expenses relating to the incurrence of such debt or equity
financing; (B) any post-Closing or pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization, ownership or other pro forma adjustments desired to be
incorporated into any information used in connection with the Debt Financing;

or any adjustments that are not directly related to the acquisition of the
Company by Parent;

 



 

(vi) execute and deliver as of (but not prior to) the Closing any pledge and

"authorization letters", authorizing, among other things, the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and identifying, among other things, any
portion of such

 



      
 

 



 

information that constitutes material, non-public information regarding the
Company and its subsidiaries or their respective securities, which shall be
executed by an officer of the Company prior to Closing), (B) the effectiveness
thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence
of the Closing and (C) no liability shall be imposed on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or employees involved
prior to the Closing Date) and otherwise reasonably facilitate the pledging of
collateral and the perfection of applicable security interests;

 



 

(vii) causing the taking of corporate and other actions by the Company and its
Subsidiaries that are reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date and to permit the proceeds thereof to be
made available to the Parent as of the Closing; it being understood and agreed
that (A) no such corporate or other action will take effect prior to the
Closing and (B) any such corporate or other action will only be required of
the directors, members, partners, managers or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who retain their respective positions as of the Closing,

Closing a customary payoff letter in respect of the Credit Facility, which
payoff letter shall (x) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully
satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage
costs or other similar obligations related to the Credit Facility as of the
Closing Date (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") and (y) state that all obligations
(including guarantees) in respect thereof (other than those contingent
indemnification obligations that customarily remain following termination of a
credit agreement) and Liens in connection therewith on the assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be, substantially concurrently with
the receipt of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, released or arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to Parent for such release shall have been made by
such time; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the delivery of
the payoff letter pursuant to this

 



       
 

 



 

paragraph by the Company to Parent shall not be a condition to the Closing,
and the Offer and the Closing is not conditioned upon Parent receiving such
payoff letter.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all such requested
cooperation provided in accordance with this Section 5.11 shall not
unreasonably interfere with the normal business or operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (it being acknowledged that the required cooperation set

Material Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors (with respect to any Subsidiary of the Company)
or employees shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any
agreement with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters
that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to
the Closing and no directors of the Company that will not be continuing
directors, acting in such capacity, shall be required to execute or enter into
or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing. If the Closing Date

within 30 days of written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket Expenses (including (A) reasonable
attorneys fees and (B) Expenses of the Companys accounting firms engaged to
assist in connection with the Financing, including performing additional
requested procedures, reviewing any offering documents, participating in any
meetings and providing any comfort letters) incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
Financing, including the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Representatives contemplated by this Section (c) and (II) shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all Damages or Expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including the performance of their respective obligations under, or the
taking of or refraining from any action in accordance with, this Section
5.11), in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing was suffered
or incurred as a result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their
respective Affiliates and Representatives.

 



 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos solely in connection
with the Financing; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall ensure that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or the Companys reputation or
goodwill and will comply with the Companys usage requirements to the extent
made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

Financing, or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing.

Exchange Act.

language to Article III and Article IV, each party to this Agreement has or
may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a
section of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an
admission by such party that such item is material, that such item would have
or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that the disclosure of such be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
Law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or Liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion. Any
purported assignment without such prior written consents shall be null and
void.

 



 

Section 8.15 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies (including those as set forth in Section 7.3) would not
be an adequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to Section 8.15(b), the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy at law or
in equity, and the parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for
the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. Each
party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that or otherwise
assert that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.15(a), the right of
the Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded (whether under this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) to
fund the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration and Parents and Merger
Subs obligations to cause the Offer Acceptance Time to occur and to effect
the Closing (but not the right of the Company to seek such injunctions,
specific performance or other equitable remedies for any other reason) shall
be subject to the requirements that (i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii)
with respect to the consummation of the Offer (including the payment of the
Offer Price and drawing down the Equity Financing related thereto), all Offer
Conditions were satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Offer Acceptance Time, but subject to such conditions
being able to be satisfied) or validly waived in accordance with the terms
hereof at the Expiration Time, (iii) with respect to the consummation of the
Merger (including the payment of the Merger Consideration and drawing down the
Equity Financing related thereto) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 were
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Effective Time, but subject to such conditions being able to be
satisfied) or validly waived in accordance with the terms hereof at the
Effective Time, (iv) the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) has been
funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance
with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing ( _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to
draw down the Equity Commitment Letter or consummate the Offer and the Closing
if the Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) is not in fact funded at
Closing and (v) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent
that (A) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing (or Alternative Financing) are funded, the Closing will occur
substantially simultaneously with the drawdown of the Equity Financing and the
Debt Financing (or Alternative Financing) and the Company has not revoked,
withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation and (B) the Company is
prepared, willing and able to effect the Closing and the Transactions, then it
would take such actions required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing
to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.4(b), the Company shall not be
entitled to specific performance under this Section 8.15 and the Parent
Termination Fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy, as provided
by Section 7.6(d).

 



 

Section 8.16 _Non-Recourse_. All Legal Actions (whether in Contract or in
tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement or the Related Documents or the negotiation, execution,
performance or non-performance of this Agreement or the Related Documents
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement, the Related Documents or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the Related Documents) may be made by any party hereto only
against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto or
thereto. In no event shall any named party to this Agreement or the Related
Documents have any shared or vicarious Liability for the actions or omissions
of any other Person. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement or
the Related Documents, including any director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
Representative of any named party to this Agreement that is not itself a named
party to this Agreement or any of the Related Documents, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Lender Related Party (" _Non-Party Affiliates_ "),
shall have any Liability (whether in Contract or in tort, in law or in equity,
or based upon any theory that seeks to impose Liability of an entity party
against its owners or Affiliates) to any party to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement for any Liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include those
Liabilities arising under the Debt Financing that may be asserted by the
parties thereto), the Related Documents or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of this Agreement, the Related Documents or their negotiation
or execution; and each party hereto or thereto waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party Affiliates. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Non-Party Affiliates are intended
third-party beneficiaries of this Section 8.16.

 



 

Section 8.17 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon
a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an
original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as a
pdf attachment to electronic mail shall be treated as original signatures for
all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when,
and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart signed by
all of the other parties hereto.

 **Annex I**

 



 

 **Offer Conditions**

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer and in
addition to (and not in limitation of) Merger Subs right to extend and amend
the Offer pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the
Exchange Act, Merger Sub shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be
required to cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment or pay for any shares of
Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
if any of the following conditions exist or have occurred and are continuing
at the scheduled Expiration Time of the Offer:

 



 

(a) _Minimum Condition_. The number of shares of Common Stock validly tendered
(and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the Offer (but
excluding shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have
not yet been "received", as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL),
together with the shares of Common Stock then owned by Merger Sub, do not
represent at least one share more than 50% of the then outstanding shares of
Common Stock (the " _Minimum Condition_ ").

 



 

(b) _Legal Restraints_. An Order shall have been issued by a Governmental
Authority or an applicable Law shall be in effect that would (i) make the
Offer or the Merger illegal or (ii) otherwise prevent the consummation
thereof.

 



 

(c) _Governmental Consents_. Any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger under the HSR Act
shall not have expired or been terminated.

 



 

(d) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Company (i) set forth in Section 3.12(b) ( _Absence of Certain Changes_ )
of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the
Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration Time,
(ii) set forth in Section 3.8(a) and (d) ( _Capitalization_ ) of the Agreement
shall not be true and correct in all respects (except for _de minimis_
inaccuracies) as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as
of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such earlier date), (iii) set forth in Section 3.3 (
_Corporate Authorization_ ), Section 3.4 ( _Enforceability_ ), the second
sentence of Section 3.5 ( _Subsidiaries_ ), Sections 3.8(b), (c), (e), (f) and
(g) ( _Capitalization_ ), Section 3.28 ( _Opinion of Financial Advisors_ ) and
Section 3.29 ( _Brokers_ ) of the Agreement shall not be true and correct in
all material respects as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though
made as of the Expiration Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) and (iv) set forth in the
Agreement, other than those Sections specifically identified in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of this paragraph (d), shall not be true and correct
(disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to "materiality", "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth therein) as of
the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the Expiration
Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
as of such earlier date), except, in the case of this clause (iv), where the
failure to be true and correct

 



      
 

 



 

would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by an executive officer of the Company to such effect.

 



 

(e) _Compliance with Covenants_. The Company shall not have complied with or
performed in all material respects its obligations, agreements and covenants
required to be complied with or performed by it prior to the Expiration Time
under the Agreement and such failure to comply or perform shall not have been
cured by the Expiration Time. Parent shall not have received a certificate
signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such
effect.

 



 

(f) _Company Material Adverse Effect Condition_. Since the date of the
Agreement there shall have been any Effect that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall not have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer
of the Company to such effect.

 



 

(g) _No Termination of Agreement_. The Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

 



 

(h) _Marketing Period_. The Marketing Period shall not have been completed.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, other than the Minimum Condition, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their respective sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

 



 

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed unless specifically defined in this
Annex I.
