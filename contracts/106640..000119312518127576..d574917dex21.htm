adjustment in accordance with Section 2.5, the amount shall be added to or

amount shall be added to or subtracted from the Final Purchase Price

Chinese Taxes imposed on indirect stock transfers); _provided,_

 





 

22   _however_ , that Buyer will provide 15 days notice to Seller prior to
withholding to give Seller an opportunity to provide additional information or
to apply for an exemption from, or a reduced rate of, withholding. If any
amount is so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person with respect to which such
deduction or withholding was imposed.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Buyer is required by applicable Law to
deduct or withhold Taxes from any consideration or other amounts payable in
connection with this Agreement solely as a result of using an acquisition
entity organized in a jurisdiction other than Japan or the Netherlands, then
(and only then) Buyer shall pay, in addition to the amount otherwise due to
Seller, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount
actually paid to Seller shall equal the full amount Seller would have received
had the applicable acquisition been effected by a Dutch or Japanese entity.
Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be remitted by Buyer to the
appropriate Taxing Authority on a timely basis and Buyer will promptly submit
to Seller a Tax payment certificate or other documentation, to the extent
issued by the applicable Taxing Authority, certifying the payment of such
amount.

The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding
this Section 2.8. In the event the Parties are unable to timely resolve any
such disputes at least 10 days prior to a payment in connection with this
Agreement, the Parties shall submit to the Accounting Firm for review and
resolution any and all matters that remain in dispute, and the Accounting
Firm shall resolve such dispute five days prior to such payment. The
Accounting Firms determination shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to the Parties and shall be final, binding and non-appealable. All
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller.

banker, attorney or

 





 

49  other advisor or Representative of any of the foregoing, shall be deemed to

books and records) relating to the Transferred Press Subsidiaries and the
Press Business as Buyer shall reasonably request from time to time, and (b)
furnish promptly to Buyer any information concerning the Transferred Press
Subsidiaries or the Press Business as Buyer may reasonably request; provided
that Seller may restrict the foregoing access to the extent required by
applicable Law or if Seller reasonably believes that the information requested
by Buyer is subject to confidentiality obligations to third parties or the
disclosure of such information would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege (in which case Seller and the Press Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to communicate the applicable information to Buyer in a way
that would not violate such Law or confidentiality obligations or would
not result in a loss of such privilege) or subject Seller to the risk of
liability; and provided, further, that in the exercise of the foregoing
rights, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, unduly
interfere with the operation and conduct of the Press Business. All
information received pursuant to this Section 5.1.3 shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Any such furnishing of such
information to Buyer or any investigation by Buyer shall not affect Buyers
right to rely on any representations and warranties made in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
and Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Transferred Press Subsidiaries

unrelated to the Press Business.  
---|--- 



     | (iii) | From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date,
Seller shall furnish to Buyer (i) within 20 days after the last day of each

days after the last day of the fiscal year of the Press Business ending
December 31, 2018, copies of the audited balance sheet and statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholders equity for the Press Business as of
such date for the fiscal year then ended. Each of the financial statements
delivered pursuant to this Section 5.1.3(iii) shall be prepared in accordance
with the Accounting Principles.  
---|---|--- 



     | 5.1.4 | Public Announcements 
---|---|--- 

Seller and each Press Seller shall not, and shall not permit their Affiliates
to, make any public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the
prior written consent of Buyer, except as required by applicable Law, in which
case Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer
with sufficient time, consistent with such requirements, to review the nature
of such requirements and to comment upon such disclosure prior to publication.

pursuant to this Agreement (the "Restructuring Plan"). Seller may in good
faith, with the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, periodically revise the
Restructuring Plan. The separation of the Press Business from Seller and the
Press Sellers, including as contemplated by the Restructuring Plan and any
revisions thereto, (x) shall not materially adversely affect the operation of
the Press Business after Closing and (y) shall be structured in Italy
as either a transfer of a going concern ( _cessione_ _di_ _ramo_ ___d_ __
_azienda_ ) or a contribution in kind of a going concern ( _conferimento_ _in_
_natura_ _di_ _ramo_ _ _ _d_ __ _azienda_ ) to Italy Newco, and not as a
demerger. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
date that is 90 days from the date of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith any proposed amendments to the Restructuring Plan with
a view to optimizing value to each of Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the other hand. The performance of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.1.5(ii) by either of Buyer or Seller
shall not be a condition precedent to the obligation of any Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

51 to Closing, at Sellers sole cost and expense, effect the Restructuring Plan
in accordance with its terms and take all actions within its reasonable
control contemplated by the Restructuring Plan and Buyer shall cooperate in
good faith with respect thereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
day that is 90 days after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall, in

setting forth in reasonable detail the steps and transactions in furtherance
of implementation of the Restructuring Plan and Sellers obligations set forth
in Section 5.1.5(v) (an initial draft of which shall be provided to Buyer no
later than the day that is 30 days after the date of this Agreement). Seller
may in good faith, with the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, periodically revise the
Micro Plan. The Micro Plan, as it may be so revised, shall be implemented and
effected by Seller and its Affiliates prior to Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prior to Closing, at Sellers sole
cost and expense, take all actions within its reasonable control to effect
all transfers and to take such actions within its reasonable control as are
necessary so that, except as set forth in the Transitional Services Agreement,
(a) any right, Contract, Consent, asset or liability owned, used or held for
use primarily in the conduct of the Press Business, or otherwise necessary
for the Press Business to be fully operational on a stand-alone basis (other
than Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities), including any Asset or Assumed
Liability, is owned or held by a Transferred Press Subsidiary and (b) any
right, Contract, Consent, asset or liability not owned, used or held for use
primarily in the Press Business (other than Assets and Assumed Liabilities),
including any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability, is not owned or held by
any Transferred Press Subsidiary. Prior to Closing, Seller shall consult in
good faith with Buyer and keep Buyer reasonably informed on a current basis as
to the implementation of the foregoing covenant in this Section 5.1.5(v) and
the Restructuring Plan and the Micro Plan, and shall consider in good faith
any comments or requests of Buyer with respect thereto. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.1.6 | Schedule Updates 
---|---|--- 

Seller shall, from time to time prior to the Closing Date, but no
more frequently than monthly, supplement the disclosure schedules with
respect to any fact, event, development, occurrence or condition that would,
in the absence of such update, reasonably be expected to cause a material
breach of or material inaccuracy in any of the representations or warranties
set forth in Article 3. If, as a result of the delivery of such update, Buyer
has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant

 





 

52  to Section 8.1.6 but Buyer does not elect so to terminate this Agreement
thereunder 30 days after receipt of such update (the "Termination Option
Date"), then Buyer shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to the matters specifically set forth in
such update. No such supplement or amendment to the Schedules shall have any
effect for the purpose of determining whether any Person is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Article 9.



     | 5.1.7 | Further Actions 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Seller and the Press Sellers shall, as promptly as
practicable and advisable (with a view to ensuring Closing occurs by the

Affiliates to, promptly coordinate, assist fully and cooperate with Buyer in

obligations of Seller and the Press Sellers set forth in Section 5.2.4. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | Subject to the foregoing, Seller shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take all other actions and to do all other things necessary,

was within the six months preceding such solicitation, an employee of Buyer or
an Affiliate of Buyer or (ii) any other employee of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates who was expressly first introduced to Seller or any of
its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (any such Person described in the immediately foregoing clause (i)
or clause (ii), a "Covered Business Employee"); provided that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to (x) generalized searches for
employees through media advertisements of general circulation, employment
search firms, open job fairs or other similar means which are not specifically
targeted at such Covered Business Employees or (y) any Covered Business
Employee whose employment is terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including any Transferred Press Subsidiary).



     | 5.1.10 | Non-Competition 
---|---|--- 

As an inducement to cause Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller and the
Press Sellers agree that for a period of three years after the Closing Date,
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall engage, either directly or
indirectly, as a principal or for its own account, solely or jointly with
others, or as stockholders in any corporation or joint stock association
anywhere in the world in any Competing Business; provided that nothing herein

contrary, nothing within this Section 5.1.10 shall restrict the actions of
Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Retained Business.

 





 

54 ---|---|--- 

Seller and each Press Seller acknowledges that: (i) Sellers and each Press
Sellers obligations under Section 5.1.10 are reasonable in the context of the
nature of the Press Business and the competitive injuries likely to be
sustained by the Press Business and Buyer if Seller, any Press Seller or any
of their Affiliates were to violate such obligations; (ii) the covenants in
Section 5.1.10 are adequately supported by consideration from Buyer for the
benefit of Seller and the Press Sellers; and (iii) the foregoing makes it
necessary for the protection of the Press Business and Buyer that Seller and
each Press Seller uphold Sellers and each Press Sellers obligations under
Section 5.1.10 for the reasonable time period contained therein. It is the
intention of the Parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained therein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform Section 5.1.10 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law. Seller and each Press Seller
acknowledges that Buyer would be irreparably harmed by any breach of Section
5.1.10 and that there would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to
compensate Buyer for any such breach. Seller and each Press Seller agrees
that Buyer shall be entitled to injunctive relief requiring specific
performance by Seller and each Press Seller of Section 5.1.10, and Seller and
each Press Seller consents to the entry thereof. If it shall be
judicially determined that Seller or any Press Seller has violated Section
5.1.10, then the period applicable to each obligation that Seller and each
Press Seller has been determined to have violated will automatically be
extended by a period of time equal in length to the period during which such
violation(s) occurred.

Hedging Contracts 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | On or prior to Closing, Seller and the Press Sellers shall
take any and all actions necessary to (a) terminate any contract (other than
any outstanding partially executed Ordinary Course trading contract
or purchase order) between a Transferred Press Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and Seller, any Press Seller or any of their Affiliates (other than a
Transferred Press Subsidiary), on the other hand, and (b) cancel or repay and
settle in cash any and all Indebtedness or other amounts owed (except for any
such amounts arising out of Ordinary Course trading) by any Transferred Press
Subsidiary to Seller, any Press Seller or any of their Affiliates (other than
a Transferred Press Subsidiary), or by Seller, any Press Seller or any of
their Affiliates (other than a Transferred Press Subsidiary) to any
Transferred Press Subsidiary. 
---|---|--- 
 





 

55 termination of this Agreement and Closing, Seller and the Press Sellers shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 5.1.3(i), promptly coordinate, assist and
cooperate with Buyer in providing such information and supplying such
assistance as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyer
entering into hedging or swap Contracts, agreements or similar arrangements
to replace the Business Hedging Contracts following Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | To the extent any Business Hedging Contract cannot be
transferred or assigned to a Transferred Press Subsidiary in a form such that
no further third party consents would be required prior to Closing, Seller and
the Press Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
settle or cancel all such Business Hedging Contracts prior to Closing. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.1.13 | Confidentiality 
---|---|--- 

Seller and the Press Sellers shall not, and shall cause their
controlled Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
without Buyers consent, disclose to any third party (other than each other
and their respective Representatives) any confidential or proprietary
information of any Transferred Press Subsidiary or otherwise relating to the
Press Business or any information disclosed to Seller pursuant to the exercise
of its rights under Section 5.2.1 ("Seller Restricted Information"); provided
that the foregoing restriction shall not (i) apply to any information (a)
generally available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of
disclosure in violation of this Section 5.1.13) or (b) independently developed
by Seller, the Press Sellers or any of their Affiliates (other than by the
Transferred Press Subsidiaries or the Press Business prior to Closing) without
reference to any Seller Restricted Information, or (ii) prohibit any
disclosure required by Law so long as, to the extent legally permissible,
Seller or the Press Sellers provides Buyer with reasonable prior notice of
such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity to contest such disclosure.

 



     | 5.1.14 | Transitional Services Agreement and Supply Agreement 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

Promptly after the date hereof, the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts
and negotiate in good faith to draft and complete schedules to the
Transitional Services Agreement on the basis of the principles set forth in
the form of the Transitional Services Agreement attached hereto and with a
view to making available to Buyer pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements,
together with the Assets conveyed at Closing, all of the assets, interests and
rights that are necessary to conduct the Press Business as conducted as of the
date of this Agreement and as conducted for the 12 months prior to the
Closing Date (except for any effects arising out of or relating to Buyers
decision not to acquire the equity interest in Embraco Europe or any of its
assets other than the Italian Transferred Assets) (the "TSA Principles").
In connection therewith, Seller and the Press Sellers shall, and shall
procure that each Transferred Press Subsidiary shall, provide Buyer and its
Representatives with reasonable access to local management of the Press
Business, subject to and on the basis set forth in Section 5.1.3, for
purposes of drafting and completing such schedules. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i) 

---|---|--- 
 





 

56 or waived (other than conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied at
Closing), (ii) at such time, all schedules to the Transitional Services
Agreement have not been completed and agreed to by the Parties ("Disputed
Schedules"), and (iii) Seller has delivered a written notice to Buyer setting
forth why its proposal as to the Disputed Schedules reasonably complies with
the TSA Principles, the fact that the Disputed Schedules have not been agreed
to shall not be a basis for either Party refusing to consummate Closing. In
such case, the services that are the subject of the Disputed Schedules shall
be provided pursuant to the Transitional Services Agreement on the basis of
Sellers proposed version of such Disputed Schedules until the Parties
otherwise agree. Nothing herein shall limit the right of any Party to seek
indemnification under Article 9 with respect to any claim that the schedules
to the Transitional Services Agreement do not comply with this Section

on Exhibit A-2. In the event the Parties are unable to agree on a definitive
supply agreement prior to Closing, upon Closing the terms in Exhibit A shall
be binding upon the Parties, and such failure to agree shall not be a basis
for either Party refusing to consummate Closing.

     | 5.2.1 | Access and Information 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) |

After Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Transferred Press Subsidiaries
to, at Sellers sole cost and expense (x) give Seller and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties,
assets, book and records relating to the Press Business to the extent they are
necessary to (a) prepare for and participate in any investigation and defend
or prosecute any claims relating to or involving Seller or any of the Press
Sellers, or in relation to the Press Business and in which Seller or any of
the Press Sellers has an interest (in each case, other than directly in
connection with any arbitration proceeding brought under Section 11.14, the
rules of discovery of which shall be governed by the ICC Rules of
Arbitration), (b) discharge Sellers obligations under this Agreement and (c)
comply with financial reporting requirements and (y) afford Seller and its
Representatives reasonable assistance in connection with the foregoing. All
information received pursuant to this Section 5.2.1(i) shall be governed by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.1.13. Buyer may
restrict the foregoing access and assistance to the extent required by
applicable Law or if Buyer reasonably believes that the information requested
by Seller is subject to confidentiality obligations to third parties or the
disclosure of 

---|---|--- 
 





 

57 privilege (in which case Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Seller in a way that would not
violate such Law or confidentiality obligations or would not result in a loss
of such privilege). In exercising its rights set forth in this Section
5.2.1(i), Seller shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to,
unduly interfere with the operation and conduct of the Press Business and any
other business of Buyer. All information received pursuant to this Section
5.2.1(i) shall be subject to Section 5.1.13. 
---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | After Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Transferred
Press Subsidiaries to, retain all of the books and records relating to the

as presently in effect on the date hereof, or as may be reasonably amended
and notified to Buyer prior to Closing, _provided, however_ , that such books
and records shall be kept for a minimum period of 7 years following the
Closing Date (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall prevail over any
record retention policies which provide for a shorter retention period).
Following the expiration of the seven-year period beginning on the Closing
Date, Buyer shall not dispose, or permit the disposal, of any such books and
records not required to be retained under such policies without giving 60
days prior written notice to Seller and offering to deliver the same to
Seller at Sellers expense.

     | 5.2.2 | Public Announcements 
---|---|--- 

Buyer shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, make any
public announcement in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior written
consent of Seller, except as required by applicable Law, in which case Buyer
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide Seller with
sufficient time, consistent with such requirements, to review the nature of
such requirements and to comment upon such disclosure prior to publication.

 



     | 5.2.3 | Guarantees and Third Party Assurances 
---|---|--- 

The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to ensure
that all guarantees set forth on Schedule 5.2.3 are either replaced with a

Affiliates (other than the Transferred Press Subsidiaries) (collectively, the
"Seller Guarantors") is released from its obligations in respect of such
guarantee, in each case at Closing. In addition, for 12 months following
Closing at Sellers sole cost and expense, the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts upon becoming aware of any other guarantees in the name of
any Seller Guarantor in respect of the Press Business to either replace such
guarantee with a guarantee in the name of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or procure that such Seller Guarantor is released from its obligations in
respect of such guarantee. In the event that any Seller Guarantor remains
liable under any such guarantee after Closing, (a) such Seller Guarantor shall
be indemnified by Buyer from and against the amount of any and all Losses

 





 

58  incurred by such Seller Guarantor to the extent arising out of such
guarantee, (b) if Seller so requests in writing, Buyer shall cooperate, or
continue to cooperate, with Seller and Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to terminate or cause to be
terminated as provided above, or cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be
substituted in all respects for any such Seller Guarantor in respect of, all
liabilities of the Seller Guarantors under any surviving guarantee and (c)
Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Transferred Press Subsidiaries not to,
renew or extend the term of or increase its obligations under, or transfer to
another third party, any loan, lease, Contract or other obligation for which
any Seller Guarantor is liable under such guarantee unless Buyer or one of its
Affiliates is substituted in all respects for the Seller Guarantors, and the
Seller Guarantors are released in respect of all liabilities of the Seller
Guarantors, under such guarantee.

with its antitrust counsel with respect to the foregoing covenant prior to

   6 | Employees and Employee Benefit Plans 
---|--- 



     | 6.1 | General 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.1.1 | During the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, Buyer shall not effect a collective
dismissal of Press Employees to accomplish the closing or shut down of any
manufacturing facility in full or substantially as a whole and shall not
constructively effect any such collective dismissal by means of a collective
reduction of the base salary and incentive compensation opportunities of the
employees within the Transferred Press Business at any manufacturing
facility. 
---|---|--- 
 





 

61 employees of the Transferred Press Subsidiaries are eligible to participate in
to take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder,
except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or
to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits, service by
employees of the Transferred Press Subsidiaries as if such service were with
Buyer, to the same extent such service was credited under a comparable plan.
During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, Buyer shall (i) honor all employee benefit obligations to
current and former employees under the employee benefit plans and (ii)
maintain in effect with respect to Press Employees base salary, incentive
compensation opportunities and employee benefits (other than any stock

benefit plan.

     | 6.1.3 | No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any
Benefit Plan. This Section 6.1.3 shall not prevent the parties entitled to
enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but

on the grounds that it is an amendment to such Benefit Plan. If a party not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such Benefit Plan and that
provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly
designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively
as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect. 
---|---|--- 



     | 6.1.4 | Upon completion of the Restructuring Plan and the Micro

will be transferred as part of the Italian Distribution Business to Italy
NewCo in accordance with the Italian provisions implementing European
Directive 2001/23 of 12 March 2001 (the "Acquired Rights Directive"). Without
prejudice and in addition to the obligations of Buyer set out in Sections
6.1.1, 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 above (which shall apply also with respect of the

ensure that the Italian Distribution Business Employees are not relocated
outside the Province of Turin. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that all
liabilities related to the Italian Distribution Business
Employees transferred pursuant to the Acquired Rights Directive shall be
borne by Buyer. If a transfer of the Italian Distribution Business Employees
pursuant to the Acquired Rights Directive is not achievable by the Closing
Date and, as a result, Embraco Europe terminates the employment of the
Italian Distribution Business Employees, any liabilities arising out of such
termination, including any costs of continued employment during any mandatory
information, consultation, or other statutory process required by the
dismissal shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller.

Party to the Party required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying
Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party has received written notice of
such Third Party Claim. Such notice shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the
basis on which indemnification is being asserted (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party), (ii) provide a
reasonable estimate of the amount of the Losses asserted therein based on the
information then available to it, (iii) specify the provision or provisions of
this Agreement under which such Losses are asserted and (iv) include copies
of all notices and documents (including court papers) served on or received by
the Indemnified Party from such third party; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that
(subject to Section 9.8.1(iii)) failure to give such notification shall not

Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.

     | 9.5.2 |

Upon receipt of such notice, the Indemnifying Party may elect to participate
in such claim or action and to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
and to be represented by counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party, at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party, by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 20 days after the Indemnified Party has provided
notice of the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may elect to
participate in any such defense at such Indemnified Partys sole expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnifying Party at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i)
requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate, (ii) in the reasonable
opinion of counsel to the Indemnifying Party, a material conflict exists
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such
separate representation advisable or (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief or relief other than monetary damages for
which the Indemnified Party would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement or may otherwise materially adversely affect the Indemnified Party
or (iv) the Third Party Claim is a criminal or regulatory action, or relates
to such an action, or the underlying facts or circumstances of which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such an action; _provided_ , _further_

Party Claim. Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying
Party, in the defense of any such Third Party Claim, shall consent to entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement; _provided, however_ , that
such consent is not required for any such settlement if (i) the sole relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) such settlement does not include any order, injunction or other equitable
relief, directly or indirectly, against the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates and (iii) such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of
such Third Party Claim and does not include any statement as to or any
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that the Indemnified Party
may have available to it one or more defenses or counterclaims that are
inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, at all times to take over
and assume control over the defense, settlement, negotiations or Litigation
relating to any such Third Party Claim, for the avoidance of doubt at the
Indemnifying Partys expense; provided that if the Indemnified Party does so
take over and assume control, the Indemnified Party shall not settle such
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,

reasonably advised of the status of such Third Party Claim and the defense
thereof and shall consider in good faith any reasonable recommendations made
by the non-controlling Party with respect thereto.

If an Indemnified Party sustains any Losses not involving a Third Party Claim
that such Indemnified Party believes gives rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall, if it intends to make
a claim with respect thereto against an Indemnifying Party, deliver notice of
such claim to the Indemnifying Party. The failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party shall have been materially and adversely
prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days after its receipt of such notice
that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party,
such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such claim to the Indemnified Party
promptly after demand therefor or, in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date
on which such

any third party (a "Potential Contributor") based on the underlying claim
asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall pursue
all rights against the Potential Contributor to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

     | 9.5.6 | The Parties shall cooperate with each other with respect

     | 9.6 | Duty to Mitigate 
---|---|--- 

Each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonable steps to mitigate, in accordance with applicable Law, any Loss upon
becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected
to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs only to the minimum
extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss.



     | 9.7 | Environmental Matters 
---|---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 9 and without
limiting Section 9.3, with respect to any claim for indemnification hereunder
for any breach of Section 3.17 (collectively, "Environmental Matters"), the
parties agree on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates that,
in addition to the other provisions set forth in this Article 9 (and in the
case of any conflict between the provisions of this Section 9.7 and any other
provision in this Article 9, the provisions of this Section 9.7 shall prevail
and apply):



     | 9.7.1 |

Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or any of its Affiliates
for any Losses: (i) arising out of or resulting from any testing, physically
invasive investigation or sampling of soil or groundwater on, under, or

Seller or any of its Affiliates at or in connection with activities relating
to the Real Property other than such testing, physically invasive
investigation or sampling (A) conducted pursuant to a legally binding
requirement under Environmental Law, (B) conducted pursuant to the written
demand of a Governmental Authority; provided that, in the case of each of (A)
and (B), Buyer and its Affiliates have taken no steps or actions to initiate
or encourage such demand or performance outside of the Ordinary Course of
Business, including through the voluntary disclosure of environmental
information to a Governmental Authority except where such disclosure is in
response to a written request from a Governmental Authority; (C) subject to
the terms of Section 9.5, reasonably necessary to defend or resolve a Third
Party Claim; (D) required

with the Press Business as conducted on the date of this Agreement, provided
that such actions serve a legitimate business purpose and would be conducted

indemnification under this Agreement; provided further that the performance
of post-Closing testing, physically invasive investigation or sampling to
analyze potential indoor exposures of persons to Hazardous Substances at Real
Property or the presence of Hazardous Substances in building materials, other
than slabs or floors in contact with soil, shall not be deemed to limit
Sellers indemnification obligation under this Agreement so long as such
testing, physically invasive investigation or sampling serves a legitimate
business purpose to either protect human health or obtain information needed
to determine what must be done to comply with Environmental Law or Permits
issued under Environmental Law and would be conducted in the ordinary course
without regard to the possible existence of a right to indemnification under
this Agreement; or (ii) to the extent such Losses have been exacerbated,
compounded or aggravated by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any employee,
agent, contractor, tenant, lessee, sublessee, licensee, permittee or invitee
of any of the foregoing; provided that this clause (ii) shall not exclude any
such Losses to the extent that such Losses arise out of the inadvertent
exacerbation, compounding or aggravation of an unknown condition that would
have not been identified by a reasonable business person acting in compliance
with the terms of this Agreement who retained a qualified, experienced and
competent Person to perform the testing, physically invasive investigation or
sampling and such Person used reasonable care in light of the relevant facts
and circumstances.

Person or Governmental Authority under applicable Law, provided Seller uses
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of any
information provided by Buyer pursuant to this provision.

     | 9.7.3 |

Any obligation of Seller to indemnify Buyer for any Environmental Matter shall
be limited to, and its obligations under this Agreement shall be satisfied

environmental practice, the minimum standards required to be met under
applicable Environmental Law or the written demand of a Governmental
Authority, based on the use of the Real Property at the Closing Date, or as
necessary to address the terms of any applicable lease agreement in effect as

consider in good faith any reasonable comments of Buyer); (ii) select
competent counsel, contractors and consultants in connection with such
Environmental Matter; (iii) diligently and promptly pursue the
resolution thereof; and (iv) take all reasonable measures to avoid
interfering with the Ordinary Course operations of the Press Business or the
Transferred Press Subsidiaries in the manner it is being used as of the

an Environmental Matter would reasonably be expected to have a material impact
on Buyers ongoing operation of equipment at the Real Property or its ongoing
operational processes at the Real Property (based on the operation of
equipment or the operational processes at the time such Environmental Matter
is identified), Sellers defense and control of such Environmental Matter,
including the disclosure, investigation, negotiation, performance and
settlement thereof, shall be subject to Buyers participation and consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (B)

(i)-(v) the "Seller Taxes"). 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.2.2 | Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid any Taxes
attributable to the operation of the Press Business during the Tax period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, including any Taxes for any
action Buyer takes on the Closing Date but after Closing (the "Buyer Taxes"). 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.2.3 | In the case of any Straddle Period: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the periodic Taxes of or relating to the Transferred Press
Subsidiaries that are not measured by (or imposed on) income or receipts
(e.g., property Taxes) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (the "Pre-Closing Non-
Income Taxes") shall be computed based upon the ratio of the number of days in
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the number of days in the entire Tax period;
and 
---|---|--- 
 





 

77 Subsidiaries for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than Taxes described in
clause (i) above) shall be computed as if such Tax period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Income Taxes"). 
---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.2.3, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement result in the reassessment of the
value of any property owned by the Transferred Press Subsidiaries for property
Tax purposes, or the imposition of any property Taxes at a rate which is
different than the rate that would have been imposed if such transactions
had not occurred, then (y) the portion of such property Taxes for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be
determined on a daily basis, using the assessed value and Tax rate that would
have applied had such transactions not occurred, and (z) the portion of such
property Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date shall be the total property Taxes for the Straddle Period minus
the amount described in clause (y) of this sentence.



     | 10.3 | Refunds 
---|---|--- 

Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from Buyer
or its Affiliates of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes (including
refunds and credits arising by reason of amended Tax Returns filed after the
Closing Date or otherwise) with respect to any Tax period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date related to the Transferred Press
Subsidiaries. Buyer shall not make any election, file any Tax Return or take
any other action to carry-back any item of Tax loss, deduction, credit or
other benefit to any Pre-Closing Tax Period prior to Closing of the
Transferred Press Subsidiaries without the consent of Seller. Seller and Buyer
shall equitably apportion any refund or credit with respect to Taxes with
respect to a Straddle Period in a manner consistent with the principles set
forth in Section 10.2.3. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller in
order to request or pursue any refund or credit for Taxes with respect to any
Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, including
by providing any relevant documentation reasonably requested by Seller and
granting powers of attorney to any counsel retained by Seller for such
purpose.

 



     | 10.4 | Tax Cooperation 
---|---|--- 

Each of Seller and its Affiliates, on one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates,
on the other, shall (i) provide the other with such information and records
and make such of its officers, directors, employees and agents available as
may reasonably be requested by such other Party in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other proceeding that
relates to the Transferred Press Subsidiaries and (ii) promptly furnish the
other with copies of all relevant correspondence received by any Taxing
Authority in connection with any Taxes for which such other Party may have an
indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Buyer shall retain and cause
to be retained all Tax Returns and books and records with respect to Taxes,
including any Tax audit or other proceeding relating to any Straddle Period
or any period ending on or before the Closing Date until the later of (i)
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for such Tax period or
(ii) settlement or final resolution of any claim related to such Tax period.
Following the expiration of the applicable

 





 

78  statute of limitations, Buyer shall not dispose, or permit the disposal, of
any such books and records not required to be retained under such policies
without giving 60 days prior written notice to Seller and offering to
deliver the same to Seller at Sellers expense.

treatment of any specific asset or liability reflected on the balance sheet of
the Transferred Press Subsidiaries on the Closing Date; or (B) that are
incurred by virtue of a change in the use of any property of the Transferred
Press Subsidiaries if such change is made after the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | For the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnified Party shall be
compensated more than once for the same Loss. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Sellers obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Buyer and its Affiliates from Losses as set forth in this Section 10.5 shall
terminate effective 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including extensions) in respect of such Losses; provided that
with respect to any Tax Claim for which a claim for indemnification under this
Section 10.5 has been made by Buyer or its Affiliates, with
reasonable specificity, by written notice given under Section 10.6, that
Sellers indemnification obligation shall continue until the date of a final
determination of such Tax Claim. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.5.2 | Buyers Liability 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | Buyer shall, and shall cause the Transferred Press
Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against all Losses arising from: (A) all liability for Buyer
Taxes including any liability for Taxes of the Transferred Press Subsidiaries
except to the extent Seller is otherwise required to indemnify Buyer for such
Taxes pursuant to this Section 10.5; (B) any liability for Taxes that is

intended to effect any Tax election, change in accounting method, or change in
the Tax reporting treatment of any specific asset or liability reflected on
the balance sheet of the Transferred Press Subsidiaries on the Closing Date;
(C) any liability for any breach of Buyers covenants in this Article 10
relating to Taxes and (D) 50% of all Transfer Taxes. 
---|---|--- 
 





 

79 harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any such Loss shall terminate
effective 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including extensions) in respect of such Losses; provided,
further, with respect to a Tax Claim for which a claim for indemnification
under this Section 10.5 has been made by Seller or its Affiliates, with
reasonable specificity, by written notice given under Section 10.6, that
Buyers indemnification obligation shall continue until the date of a final
determination of such Tax Claim. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.5.3 | Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.1.2, any
indemnity payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 10.5 shall be
made within 30 days after the Indemnified Party makes written demand upon
the Indemnifying Party, but in no case later than 5 Business Days prior to
the date on which the relevant Taxes are required to be paid to the relevant
Taxing Authority (including estimated Tax payments). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.5.4 | Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 10.5
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.5.5 | This Section 10.5 shall govern all claims for
indemnification with respect to Taxes, and, in the event of any conflict
between this Section 10.5 and any other provision of this Agreement,
this Section 10.5 shall govern. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.6 | Tax Contests 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.6.1 | If a claim relating to any Tax audit, Tax litigation or
other Tax proceeding shall be made, whether before or after the date of this
Agreement, by any Taxing Authority verbally, electronically, telephonically or
by any other mode of communication which, if successful, would be reasonably
likely to result in an indemnity payment to Seller or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates pursuant to Section 10.5 (a "Tax Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the other party of such Tax Claim no
later than the earlier of: (i) 5 Business Days from the receipt of such notice
by the Indemnified Party or after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such
claim; or (ii) with respect to Brazil, within one-third of the applicable
period for the filing of a defense in connection thereof, except when the
applicable period is equal or shorter than 5 days, when the notice shall
be delivered within two-fifths of such response time. Such claim shall
provide: (a) the facts, matters or circumstances that could give rise to an
indemnity obligation for Seller Taxes or Buyer Taxes, as the case may be,
hereunder; (b) the basis that justifies the belief that such Tax Claim gives
rise to the right to indemnification under Section 10.5; (c) the reasonable
estimation of the Loss that has been or may be incurred or suffered by the
Indemnified Party to the extent known; and (d) all the documents and
information available, for the purpose of making it possible for the
Indemnifying Party to evaluate and defend the Tax Claim, provided that the
failure or delay to give such notice or failure to provide the information
required under this Section 10.6.1 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any indemnification obligation hereunder with respect to such Tax Claim
except to the extent of the actual, material prejudice caused. 
---|---|--- 
 





 

80 ending on or before the Closing Date, Seller shall control all proceedings and
may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including
selection of counsel), but only if Seller shall have first notified Buyer in
writing of Sellers intention to do so, and, without limiting the foregoing,
may, in its sole discretion, and in good faith, pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any Taxing
Authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay
the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund
suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner. Buyer shall be
entitled to be informed of (A) any Tax Claims asserted during such period and
(B) the developments with respect to any existing Tax Claim at any
administrative meeting, conference, hearing or other proceeding during such
period. Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of all correspondence, notices
and other written materials received from Tax Authorities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to settle any Tax Claim in respect of
any Tax Return filed by Buyer under applicable Law or that would adversely
affect in any material respect, the liability of Buyer or its Affiliates
without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle
Period, Seller and its Affiliates shall have the right to represent any
Transferred Press Subsidiarys interests and to employ counsel of its choice,
provided that Buyer shall be permitted at Buyers expense to be present at,
and to participate in, any such Tax Claim. In any case, Buyer shall be
entitled to be informed of (A) such Tax Claim within a reasonable time after
such Tax Claim is asserted and (B) the developments with respect to such Tax
Claim at any administrative meeting, conference, hearing or other proceeding.
Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of all correspondence, notices and other
written materials received from Tax Authorities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to settle any Tax Claim relating to a
Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Buyer, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.6.1(i) and
(ii), Buyer shall control all proceedings with respect to Taxes for any Tax
period beginning after the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 10.6.2 |

Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on
the other hand, shall use best efforts to cooperate in contesting any Tax
Claim, and shall use best efforts to retain and (upon request) provide to the
requesting party all records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Tax Claim, make employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional 

---|---|--- 
 





 

81 facts pertaining to such Tax Claim, or testify or act as a representative of
the Transferred Press Subsidiary at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the activities of Seller and its Affiliates
shall be conducted in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the Press Business. Buyer shall execute and deliver such powers of
attorney to the counsel retained by Seller and other documents as are
necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 10.6 in a timely manner.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees, by itself and
on behalf of its Affiliates, to make available to Seller within 10 days
following a written request from Seller in this regard, any Tax receipts, Tax
Returns, books, records, personnel, documents or information of the
Transferred Press Subsidiaries or of Seller or any Press Seller with respect
to the Press Business for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date
or Straddle Period as reasonably necessary for Seller to conduct the defense
of any Tax Claim relating to the Transferred Press Subsidiaries or of Seller
or any Press Seller with respect to the Press Business pursuant to this
Article 10, as well as (i) including any existing Tax Claim that, although
related to the Transferred Press Subsidiaries will not be transferred to
Buyer or the relevant Transferred Press Subsidiary as a result of the
Restructuring Plan and the Micro Plan, and (ii) any future Tax Claim that is
filed directly against Seller after the Closing Date and which relates to any
taxable period of the Press Business or of Seller or any Press Seller with
respect to the Press Business ending on or before the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer
to make available any Tax-related books and records or information related to
the operation of the Press Business for periods beginning after the Closing
Date, except to the extent attributable to the post-Closing portion of any
Straddle Period. Seller agrees, by itself and on behalf of its Affiliates,
that (a) it will enter into a customary confidentiality agreement with Buyer
and the Transferred Press Subsidiaries pursuant to which it shall keep any and
all information obtained pursuant to this Article 10 confidential to the same
extent that Seller keeps its own sensitive financial and Tax information
confidential, and shall use any and all information obtained pursuant to this
Article 10 for the sole purpose of contesting Tax Claims and (b) it shall not
be entitled to use any such information in a manner adverse to Buyer or the
Transferred Press Subsidiaries. Seller may not assign any rights granted under
this Section 10.6.2 without the prior written consent of Buyer, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

     | 11.3 | Entire Agreement 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement (including the Schedules hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (in each case, when
executed and delivered) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the
Parties and their respective Affiliates and Representatives with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof.



     | 11.4 | Certain Limitations 
---|---|--- 

It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the Parties that no
Party nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives is making any
representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied,
other than those set forth in Articles 3 and 4, and no Party is relying on any
statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or implied,
made by the other Party or such other Partys Affiliates or Representatives
(including with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, budgets or
other forward-looking 

 





 

84  information delivered or made available to Buyer or its Representatives)
except for the representations and warranties set forth in such Articles.
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE TRANSFERRED
PRESS SUBSIDIARIES AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT BUYER TAKES THE ASSETS OF THE
TRANSFERRED PRESS SUBSIDIARIES "AS IS" AND "WHERE IS". The Parties agree that
this is an arms-length transaction in which the Parties undertakings and
obligations are limited to the performance of their obligations under this
Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that it is a sophisticated investor, that it has
undertaken such investigation of the Transferred Press Subsidiaries as it
deems appropriate and that it has only a contractual relationship with Seller,
based solely on the terms of this Agreement, and that there is no special
relationship of trust or reliance between Buyer and Seller. The Parties have
participated jointly in the negotiating and drafting of this Agreement. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation shall arise, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.



     | 11.5 | Schedules 
---|---|--- 

The disclosure of any matter in the Schedules referenced by a
particular Section shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of any other
Section to which such disclosure is relevant, but only to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to such other Section,
but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller or
Buyer, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material for the
purposes of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
the disclosure of any matter in the Schedules is not to be treated as
constituting or implying any representation, warranty, assurance or
undertaking by Seller not expressly set forth in the Agreement, nor to be
treated as adding to or extending the scope of any of Sellers representations
or warranties in the Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides
otherwise, neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item or matter in any Schedule is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item or matter so included or other
items or matters, are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact
that such amount, item or matter has been set forth in any Schedule in any
dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any amount, item or
matter not described herein or included in any Schedule is or is not material
or is or is not in the Ordinary Course of Business, in each case for purposes
of this Agreement.



     | 11.6 | Confidentiality 
---|---|--- 

The Parties agree that, with respect to the disclosure of
information furnished hereunder or in connection herewith, the Parties shall
continue to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement.

 





 

85 ---|---|--- 

No amendment, modification or discharge of this Agreement and no waiver
hereunder shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly
executed by the Party against whom enforcement of the amendment, modification,
discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only
with respect to the specific matter described in such writing and shall in no
way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other respect
or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the Parties of a breach of
or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure
by any of the Parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the
provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder,
shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar
nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights or privileges
hereunder. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or any rights or remedies
that any Party may otherwise have at law or in equity. The exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy, based on the same facts or different facts, and the parties
acknowledge the right of a party to pursue a claim in damages or for
indemnification following a successful or unsuccessful request for specific
performance.



     | 11.8 | Severability 
---|---|--- 

If any provision of this Agreement, including any phrase, sentence, clause,
Section or subsection is inoperative or unenforceable for any reason, such
circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering the provision in question
inoperative or unenforceable in any other case or circumstance, or of
rendering any other provision or provisions herein contained invalid,
inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. If any provision of
this Agreement shall be adjudged to be excessively broad as to duration,
geographical scope, activity or subject, the Parties intend that such
provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum degree necessary to make
such provision valid and enforceable under applicable Law and that such
modified provision shall thereafter be enforced to the fullest
extent possible.



     | 11.9 | Counterparts 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts (including
by facsimile or other electronic transmission), each of which shall be deemed
an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument.



     | 11.10 | Binding Effect 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.



     | 11.11 | Assignment 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , that
Buyer may assign this Agreement in whole or in part and any or all of its
rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or designate
one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder, in each
case, so long as Buyer is not relieved of any liability or obligations
hereunder.

 





 

86 ---|---|--- 

Except as expressly provided in Article 9, nothing in this Agreement,
including anything in Article 6, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer any rights, benefits or remedies.



     | 11.13 | Governing Law 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of
New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws rules thereof to the
extent such rules would require or permit the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction.

 



     | 11.14 | Arbitration 
---|---|--- 

Subject to Section 2.3 and except as provided in Section 11.15, any dispute
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including a dispute as to
the validity, existence or termination of this Agreement or this Section 11.14
or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or relating to with this
Agreement, will be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the
International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
(the "ICC") pursuant to the ICC Rules of Arbitration. The arbitral tribunal
will consist of three arbitrators; one of whom shall be nominated by Buyer,
one of whom shall be nominated by Seller and one of whom shall be nominated by
the arbitrators nominated by Buyer and Seller, who shall serve as president
of the tribunal. The place of arbitration will be New York City, New York, and
the language of the arbitration will be English. The arbitral tribunals award
will be final and binding and not subject to any appeal. Judgment on the
award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties
hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York
State court sitting in New York City to support and assist the arbitration
process and to enforce any award.



     | 11.15 | Specific Performance 
---|---|--- 

The Parties acknowledge that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof, that there may be no adequate remedy at law for a breach of this
Agreement and that money damages may not be an appropriate remedy for such
breach. The Parties accordingly agree that each Party shall have the right to
injunctive relief and specific performance in the event that any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with the terms hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction in addition to
any rights it may have for damages, and the Parties hereby agree to: (i) not
raise any objection to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance; and (ii) waive any requirements for posting a bond in connection
with any such action. The remedies set forth in this Section 11.15 are
cumulative and shall in no way limit any other remedy any Party has at law, in
equity or pursuant hereto. 



     | 11.16 | Certain Waivers 
---|---|--- 



     | 11.16.1 | EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. 
---|---|--- 
 





 

87 FOREGO ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER IN ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM
ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (I) PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT PAYABLE TO A THIRD PARTY, OR (II) LOST PROFITS, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
