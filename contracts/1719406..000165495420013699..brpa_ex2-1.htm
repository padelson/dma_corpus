  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of December
13, 2020, by and among Big Rock Partners Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("BRPA"), NeuroRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
and Big Rock Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned Subsidiary
of BRPA ("Merger Sub"). The term "Agreement" as used herein refers to this
Agreement and Plan of Merger, as the same may be amended from time to time,
and all schedules hereto (including the Company Schedules and the BRPA
Schedules, as defined in the preambles to Articles II and III hereof,
respectively). Each of BRPA, Merger Sub, and the Company, are referred to
herein, individually, as a "Party" and, collectively, as the "Parties".
Except as otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in Exhibit A.

 

 

 RECITALS

 

 

 A. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and
in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), the
Parties intend to enter into a business combination transaction by which
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") with the
Company being the surviving entity of the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of BRPA ("Surviving Corporation"), on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

 B. The respective boards of directors of each of BRPA, Merger Sub and
the Company have each approved, declared advisable and resolved to recommend
to their respective stockholders the Transactions upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL.

 

 

 C. Pursuant to BRPA's Charter Documents, BRPA shall provide an opportunity
to its stockholders to have their BRPA Common Stock redeemed for the
consideration, and on the terms and subject to the conditions and
limitations, set forth in this Agreement, BRPA's Charter Documents, the Trust
Agreement, and the Proxy Statement in conjunction with, inter alia,
obtaining approval from the BRPA Stockholders for the Business Combination
(the "Offer").

 

 

 D. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, certain
Company Stockholders (such Company Stockholders,
the "Supporting Stockholders") shall enter into certain Voting and Support
Agreements (the "Support Agreements"), with BRPA and Merger Sub, in the
form set forth on  Exhibit B.

 

 

 E. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, BRPA shall, subject
to obtaining the BRPA Stockholder Approval, adopt the BRPA Plan in a form
reasonably acceptable to BRPA and the Company.

 

 

 F. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, BRPA shall, subject
to obtaining the BRPA Stockholder Approval, adopt an amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (the "BRPA AandR Charter") in a form reasonably
acceptable to BRPA and the Company.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 G. Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, BRPA shall adopt
the amended and restated bylaws (the "BRPA AandR Bylaws") in a
form reasonably acceptable to BRPA and the Company.

 

 

 H. The Parties intend, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that
the Merger shall constitute a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization
governed by Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code").

 

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 

 

  ARTICLE I

 

 

 THE MERGER

 

 

 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the Surviving Corporation after the Merger and as a wholly
owned Subsidiary of BRPA. The Merger will be consummated in accordance with
this Agreement and the DGCL immediately upon the filing of a certificate of
merger between Merger Sub and the Company (the "Certificate of Merger") with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as may
be agreed by BRPA and the Company in writing and specified in such filings
(the "Effective Time"). The effect of the Merger will be as provided in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the Parties or the holders of any of the
securities of the Company, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

 1.2 Governing Documents.

 

 

 (a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of Merger Sub shall become the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until thereafter supplemented or
amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL.

 

 

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the bylaws of BRPA shall be amended
and restated to be the BRPA AandR Bylaws.

 

 

 (c) Subject to obtaining the BRPA Stockholder Approval, BRPA shall file
the BRPA AandR Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

 1.3 Effect on Securities.

 

 

 

 

 

 

2

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (a) Preferred Stock Conversion. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to cause each share of Company Preferred Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time to be converted
immediately prior to the Effective Time into a number of shares of Company
Common Stock at the then-effective conversion rate (as calculated pursuant to
the Company Certificate of Incorporation) in accordance with the Company
Certificate of Incorporation (such conversions, the "Company Preferred Stock
Conversion"). Following the Company Preferred Stock Conversion all of
the shares of Company Preferred Stock shall be canceled or terminated, as
applicable, shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist and no
payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto, and each holder
of Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to
such securities. The Preferred Stock Conversion may be made contingent upon
the occurrence of the Closing.

 

 

 (b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, following the Preferred Stock Conversion), by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parties or the holders of any
of the securities of the Company, each share of Company Common
Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the Preferred
Stock Conversion) that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares to be canceled pursuant to Section
1.3(g) and the Dissenting Shares), will be automatically converted into the
right to receive (i) a number of shares of BRPA Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio (the "Per Share Merger Consideration") and (ii) a contingent
right to receive (1) a number of Earnout Shares issuable pursuant to Section
1.8(a), if any and (2) an amount of Earnout Cash payable pursuant to Section
1.8(b), if any.

 

 

 (c) Assumption of Company Stock Options.

 

 

 (i) At the Closing, without any action on the part of the holders of
any options exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock ("Company
Stock Options"), each then outstanding Company Stock Option will be assumed
by BRPA and automatically exchanged for an option to purchase shares of
BRPA Common Stock ("Substitute Options"). Each Substitute Option will be
issued pursuant to the BRPA Plan and will continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable documents
evidencing the terms of the Company Stock Option (including any applicable
incentive plan and stock option agreement or other document evidencing such
Company Stock Option) immediately prior to the Closing, including
any repurchase rights or vesting provisions, except that (i) each Substitute
Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) for that number of whole shares of BRPA Common Stock equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Closing
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of BRPA Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of BRPA Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Substitute
Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Closing by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Company shall take no
action, other than those actions contemplated by this Agreement, that will
cause or result in the accelerated vesting of the assumed Company
Stock Options. Each Substitute Option shall be vested immediately following
the Closing as to the same percentage of the total number of shares subject
thereto as the Company Stock Option was vested as to immediately prior to the
Closing. BRPA shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form or comparable form in another relevant jurisdiction)
relating to the Substitute Options promptly in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirements, and BRPA shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any
Substitute Options remain outstanding. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing Date, BRPA will use reasonable best efforts to issue to
each Person who holds a Substitute Option a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Company Stock Option by BRPA.

 (ii) In the event that either the Earnout Shares Milestone or the
Earnout Cash Milestone has not occurred during the Earnout Period,
promptly following the end of the Earnout Period the Company shall
adjust each Substitute Option (each such Substitute Option adjusted pursuant
to this Section 1.3(c)(ii), a "Post-Earnout Substitute Option")
by reducing the number of shares of BRPA Common Stock underlying any such
Substitute Option and increasing the exercise price of any such Substitute
Option such that following such adjustment contemplated by this
Section 1.3(c)(ii), the number of shares of BRPA Common Stock underlying
such Post-Earnout Substitute Option, the exercise price per share of each
such Post-Earnout Substitute Option and the aggregate intrinsic value of each
such Post-Earnout Substitute Option (and taking into account any intervening
exercises of the Substitute Option and the provisions of Section 1.3(c)(iii)
below) shall equal the respective number of shares, exercise price per share
and aggregate intrinsic value that would have resulted following
the adjustment of the applicable underlying Substitute Option had
the conversion procedures set forth in Section 1.3(c)(i) been applied
using the Option Post-Earnout Exchange Ratio in lieu of the Option Exchange
Ratio (the "Option Post-Earnout Adjustment"). Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, in the event that neither the Earnout Shares
Milestone nor the Earnout Cash Milestone occur, the Option Post-Earnout
Adjustment shall be based on the Exchange Ratio instead of the Option
Exchange Ratio (and shall take into account any intervening exercises of the
Substitute Option and the provisions of Section 1.3(c)(iii) below).

 

 

 (iii) In the event that any Substitute Option is exercised prior to
the earlier of the date on which both the Earnout Share Milestone and the
Earnout Cash Milestone have been achieved and December 31, 2022, the
optionholder shall agree, as a condition to such exercise, that a sufficient
number of shares of BRPA Common Stock (as determined below) shall not be
delivered to the optionholder but shall be held in escrow by the Company (and
may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed) pending the determination
of any Option Post-Earnout Adjustment. The number of shares of BRPA
Common Stock to be retained by the Company shall be the number that would be
forfeited as a result of the reduction pursuant to the Option Post-Earnout
Adjustment if any of the Earnout Shares Milestone or the Earnout Cash
Milestone that had not been achieved as of the date of such option exercise
was not achieved by December 31, 2022 (the "Retained Shares"). At the time
of any such exercise, the Company shall determine reasonably and in good
faith the applicable number of Retained Shares. Following the determination
of any Option Post-Earnout Adjustment, then the Company shall permanently
retain the applicable number of Retained Shares that shall be forfeited by
such optionholder, and the remaining Retained Shares shall be released
promptly thereafter to such optionholder.

 

 

 (d) Assumption of Company Warrants. At the Closing, without any action on
the part of the holders of any Company Warrants, each then outstanding
Company Warrant will be assumed by BRPA and automatically treated as if such
Company Warrant were a Company Stock Option in accordance
with Section 1.3(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (e) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The number of shares of BRPA
Common Stock issuable as Merger Consideration or any amount contained herein
which is based upon the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into shares of BRPA Common Stock, Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, as applicable), extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to shares of BRPA Common Stock, Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable occurring on or after
the date hereof but at or prior to the Effective Time (or, as it relates to
the Earnout Shares, prior to the date of issuance of such Earnout Shares in
accordance with Section 1.8); provided, however, that this Section
1.3(e) shall not be construed to permit BRPA or the Company to take any
action with respect to their respective securities that is prohibited by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

 

 (f) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of BRPA Common Stock will be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock (including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the
Company Preferred Stock Conversion), and each holder of Company Common Stock
or Company Preferred Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of
a share of BRPA Common Stock at any time shares of BRPA Common Stock are
distributed to any such Person pursuant to this Agreement (after aggregating
all fractional shares that otherwise would be received by such holder in
connection with such distribution) shall receive from BRPA, in lieu of such
fractional share, one (1) share of BRPA Common Stock.

 

 

 (g) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of any holder thereof,
each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company, BRPA, or Merger Sub
or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of any of the
foregoing immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect thereof.

 

 

 (h) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock into Stock of the
Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted and all such shares shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time. From and after
the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist.

 

 

 (i) No Further Ownership Rights. Until surrendered as contemplated by
Section 1.4, all of the shares of Company Common Stock (including any shares
of Company Common Stock resulting from the Preferred Stock Conversion)
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be deemed, from and after the Closing, to represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions as contemplated by Section 1.3(e) and the contingent right to
receive the Earnout Consideration. If, after the Closing, shares of
Company Common Stock (including any shares of Company Common Stock resulting
from the Preferred Stock Conversion) are presented to BRPA or the Company for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 1.4 Exchange Procedures.

 

 

 (a) Appointment of Exchange Agent. BRPA and the Company shall appoint
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company ("Continental"), or if
Continental shall be unavailable, a mutually agreeable bank or trust company,
to act as exchange agent and paying agent ("Exchange Agent") for
the distribution of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and the
Earnout Consideration (if earned pursuant to Section 1.8) to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to this Section 1.4 and an exchange agent
agreement in form and substance mutually agreeable to BRPA and the
Company ("Exchange Agent Agreement").

 

 

 (b) Delivery of Closing Consideration to Exchange Agent. Immediately
following the Effective Time, BRPA will deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Exchange Agent such number of shares of BRPA Common Stock equal to the
aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement. The Exchange Agent will be deemed to be the agent for the
Company Stockholders for the purpose of receiving the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration and BRPA shall cause the Exchange Agent, pursuant
to irrevocable instructions, to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Until they are
distributed, the shares of BRPA Common Stock held by the Exchange Agent will
be deemed to be outstanding from and after the Effective Time, but the
Exchange Agent will not vote those shares or exercise any rights of a
stockholder with regard to them. If any dividends or distributions are paid
with regard to shares of BRPA Common Stock while they are held by
the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent will hold the dividends
or distributions, uninvested, until shares of BRPA Common Stock
are distributed to the Company Stockholders, at which time the
Exchange Agent will distribute the dividends or distributions that have
been paid with regard to those shares of BRPA Common Stock to the
former Company Stockholders.

 

 

 (c) Letters of Transmittal. Concurrently with the mailing of the Consent
Solicitation Statement, BRPA shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to
each Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal (and any instructions
related thereto) in form and substance reasonably acceptable to BRPA and the
Surviving Corporation (the "Letter of Transmittal") to be completed and
executed by such Company Stockholder to receive such Company Stockholder's
Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 1.3(a) and such
Company Stockholder's pro rata portion of the Earnout Consideration, if
payable pursuant to Section 1.8. The Letter of Transmittal will contain,
among other things, customary representations of each Company Stockholder
relating to (as applicable for Company Stockholders that are individuals)
existence, power and authority, due authorization, due execution,
enforceability and ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock owned by
such Company Stockholder (including shares of Company Common Stock owned by
such Company Stockholder resulting from the Preferred Stock Conversion).

 

 

 (d) Delivery of Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of a validly executed and delivered Letter of Transmittal,
together with the share certificate(s) evidencing the Company Common Stock,
and/or Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, or evidence that
such securities have been transferred by book entry transfer to an account
established by the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Agent shall issue to the
applicable Company Stockholder (or its designee) the Per Share Merger
Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled under
Section 1.3(b).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (e) Delivery of Earnout Consideration. BRPA will deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to the Exchange Agent the Earnout Shares and/or Earnout Cash, as
applicable, in each case, in accordance with Section 1.8. Promptly after
the Exchange Agent's receipt of the Earnout Shares and/or Earnout Cash from
BRPA, the Exchange Agent shall deliver the Earnout Shares and/or Earnout Cash
to the Company Stockholders entitled to receive the Earnout Shares and/or
Earnout Cash pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.8.

 

 

 (f) Payment to Third Parties. If payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of a Company Stockholder is to be made to a
recipient other than the Person in whose name shares of Company Common Stock
(including shares of Company Common Stock resulting from the Preferred Stock
Conversion) are registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Person requesting such payment must provide funds for payment of
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of such securities or establish to the
satisfaction of BRPA that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 

 

 (g) Termination of Exchange Agreement. On June 30, 2023, BRPA shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to BRPA any portion of the Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent that remains undistributed to
the Company Stockholders pursuant to instructions provided to the Exchange
Agent by BRPA at such time, unless required otherwise by applicable
Legal Requirements. Thereafter, any Company Stockholders who have
not complied with the provisions of this Agreement for receiving any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Agent shall look only to BRPA for such
amounts.

 

 

 1.5 The Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Merger and the other Transactions (the "Closing") will
take place remotely via the exchange of electronic signature pages on
the second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions which
can be satisfied only at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at Closing), or at such other time and place as may
be agreed to by BRPA and the Company (such date, the "Closing Date").
Subject to the provisions of Article VII of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Closing on the date and time determined pursuant to this
Section 1.5 will not result in the termination of this Agreement and will not
relieve any Party of any obligation under this Agreement. Subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI of
this Agreement, and provided this Agreement has not theretofore been
terminated pursuant to its terms, on the Closing Date, the Company and
Merger Sub shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware as provided in Sections 251 and 103 of the DGCL.

 

 

 1.6 Deliveries at Closing. At the Closing, each Party shall deliver or
cause to be delivered all of the certificates, instruments, and other
documents required to be delivered by such Party pursuant to Article VI.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 1.7 Lock-Up Agreement. At the Closing, BRPA and the Company Stockholders
listed on Schedule 1.7 of the Company Schedules (the "Lock-Up
Stockholders") shall enter into an agreement which shall provide that the
Lock-Up Stockholders shall not transfer the shares of BRPA Common
Stock received hereunder as Per Share Merger Consideration except
to Permitted Transferees, until the earlier of (a) the six-month anniversary

timely filed all required registration statements, reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by BRPA with the
SEC since its formation (collectively, as they have been amended since the
time of their filing and including all exhibits thereto, the "BRPA
SEC Reports"). None of the BRPA SEC Reports, as of their respective dates
(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement
or the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters

SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC comment
and (ii) neither the SEC nor any other Governmental Entity is conducting any
investigation or review of any BRPA SEC Report.

the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, were
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis in
accordance with past practice during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated therein or in the notes thereto and except with respect to
unaudited statements as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and Regulation S-X
or Regulation S-K, as applicable, and fairly present (subject, in the case of

then ended.

 

 

 (c) BRPA has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to BRPA is made known to BRPA's principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer, particularly during the periods
in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared. To BRPA's knowledge, such disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in timely alerting BRPA's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included
in BRPA's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.

 

 

 (d) BRPA has established and maintained a system of internal
accounting controls. To BRPA's knowledge, such internal accounting controls

accounts and notes receivable of BRPA reflected in the BRPA
Financial Statements: (i) arose from bona fide sales transactions in the
ordinary course of business and are payable on ordinary trade terms, (ii) are

in accordance with their terms, except as such may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights

valid set-off or counterclaim to which BRPA has been notified in writing as

practice, except for liabilities and obligations (a) reflected or

Agreement, since the date of the most recent BRPA Financial Statement to the
date of this Agreement, there has not been a BRPA Material Adverse Effect,

time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

is a party which has or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any business practice of BRPA, any
acquisition of property by BRPA, or the conduct of business by BRPA. Since
its organization, Merger Sub has not conducted any business activities other
than in connection with this Agreement. In addition, none of BRPA or Merger

the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. At the Effective
Time, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (b) Access to Information.

 

 

 (i) Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and any
other confidentiality obligations and similar restrictions that may
be applicable to information furnished to the Company or its Subsidiaries by
third parties that may be in the Company's or its Subsidiaries' possession
from time to time, and except for any information which (x) in the opinion of
legal counsel of the Company would result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege or other privilege from disclosure or would conflict with
any applicable law, or (y) relates to interactions with prospective buyers
of the Company or the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions, the
Company will afford BRPA and its Representatives (subject to the execution of
customary access letters) reasonable access during normal business hours,
upon reasonable notice, in such manner as to not interfere with the normal
operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the properties, books,
records and management personnel of the Company during the Interim Period
to obtain all information concerning the business, including the status of
business development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel
of the Company, as BRPA may reasonably request; provided, that such access
shall not include any invasive or intrusive investigations or other testing,
sampling or analysis of any properties, facilities or equipment of the
Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company.
The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make
alternative arrangements for such disclosure where the restrictions in
the preceding sentence apply. No information or knowledge obtained by BRPA
in any investigation pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(i) will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Merger.

Agreement and the Transactions, BRPA will afford the Company and its
Representatives (subject to the execution of customary access letters)

in such manner as to not interfere with the normal operation of BRPA, to the
properties, books, records and personnel of BRPA during the Interim Period to
obtain all information concerning the business, including properties, results
of operations and personnel of BRPA, as the Company may reasonably request.
The Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to make alternative
arrangements for such disclosure where the restrictions in the preceding
sentence apply. No information or knowledge obtained by the Company in
any investigation pursuant to this Section 4.3(b)(ii) will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the

 4.4 Exclusivity.

 

 

 (a) During the Interim Period, to the extent not inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the BRPA Board, BRPA shall not, shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, enter into, or continue discussions, negotiations, or transactions
with, or encourage or respond to any inquiries or proposals by, or provide
any information to any Person relating to, or enter into or consummate any
transaction relating to, (i) any Business Combination, merger, or sale of
ownership interests or material assets of BRPA, or a recapitalization,
share exchange, or similar transaction with respect to BRPA or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) any financing, investment, acquisition, purchase,
merger, sale or any other similar transaction that would restrict, prohibit
or inhibit the Company's or BRPA's ability to consummate the Merger and the
other Transactions, in each case, other than the Merger and the other
Transactions (the transactions in subsections (i) and (ii),
collectively "BRPA Competing Transactions"). In addition, BRPA will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their Representatives to, promptly cease any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
BRPA Competing Transaction. BRPA will promptly (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) notify the Company if BRPA or any of its Subsidiaries, or,
to BRPA's knowledge, any of BRPA's Representatives receives any inquiry,
proposal, offer or submission with respect to a BRPA Competing Transaction
(including the identity of the Person making such inquiry or submitting
such proposal, offer or submission), after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and will provide the Company with a copy of such inquiry,
proposal, offer or submission.

 

 

 (b) During the Interim Period, to the extent not inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, the Company shall not,
shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate, enter into, or continue
discussions, negotiations, or transactions with, or encourage or respond to
any inquiries or proposals by, or provide any information to any
Person relating to, or enter into or consummate any transaction relating to,
(i) any merger or sale of ownership interests or material assets of the
Company, or a recapitalization, share exchange, or similar transaction with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) any financing,
investment, acquisition, purchase, merger, sale or any other similar
transaction that would restrict, prohibit or inhibit the Company's or
BRPA's ability to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, in each
case, other than the Merger and the other Transactions (the transactions in
subsections (i) and (ii), collectively "Company Competing Transactions").
In addition, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
use reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives
to, promptly cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Company Competing
Transaction. The Company will promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) notify BRPA if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to
the Company's knowledge, any of the Company's Representatives receives any
inquiry, proposal, offer or submission with respect to a Company Competing
Transaction (including the identity of the Person making such inquiry
or submitting such proposal, offer or submission), after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and will provide BRPA with a copy of such
inquiry, proposal, offer or submission.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall restrict or limit the ability of the
Company Board or the BRPA Board from exercising or acting in accordance with
their respective fiduciary duties under applicable law. The Parties agree
that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this Section 4.4 include
specific performance, it being acknowledged and agreed that any breach or
threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching Party
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy for such injury.

 

 

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, in response to any proposal or offer from any Person
or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) to the Company or the Company
Board with respect to a Company Competing Transaction (such proposal or
offer, an "Acquisition Proposal") that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal and that the failure to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(h) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, the Company or the Company Board may, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(h) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; provided, that the Company pays to BRPA the Termination Fee
required to be paid pursuant Section 7.2(b)(i) at or after the time of such
termination in accordance with Section 7.2(b)(i); provided, further, that
the Company will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with Section 7.1(h) unless the Company delivers to BRPA a written notice
advising BRPA that the Company Board proposes to take such action. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide and
written Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof that the Company
Board in good faith determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms
and would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable
from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company (solely in
their capacity as such) than the transactions contemplated hereby
after taking into account all such factors and matters deemed relevant
in good faith by the Company Board, including legal, financial (including
the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory, timing or other
aspects of such proposal and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

 

 4.5 Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following:
(i) the taking of such reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of such
reasonably necessary actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of such
reasonably necessary registrations, declarations and filings
(including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of such reasonable steps as may
be reasonably necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of such material
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties required as a result of the
Merger, including the consents referred to in Schedule 2.5 of the Company
Schedules, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations
or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution or delivery of
any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to require BRPA or the Company to agree to any
divestiture by itself or any of its Affiliates of shares of capital stock or
of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material
limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their business or to own
or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock.

shall (i) distribute the Registration Statement to the BRPA
Stockholders, (ii) having, prior to the SEC Approval Date, established the

proxies thereunder, and the calling and holding of the BRPA Special Meeting.
Without limiting the foregoing, BRPA and the Company shall each use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement when filed
with the SEC to comply in all material respects with all Legal Requirements
applicable thereto and to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading
(provided that no Party shall be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information relating to another Party or any
other information furnished by another Party for inclusion in
the Registration Statement).

 

 

 (f) BRPA, acting through the BRPA Board, shall recommend to its
stockholders that they approve the BRPA Stockholder Matters (the "BRPA
Board Recommendation") and shall include the BRPA Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, subject to the provisions of this Section
5.1(f). Neither the BRPA Board nor any committee or agent or representative
thereof shall withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company the
BRPA Board Recommendation (any such event, a "BRPA Change in
Recommendation"); provided, that the BRPA Board may make a BRPA Change in
Recommendation if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that a failure to make a BRPA Change in Recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

 

 5.2 Directors and Officers of BRPA After Transactions. The Parties
shall take all necessary action so that the persons listed on Schedule 5.2
of the Company Schedules are elected and appointed to the positions
of officers and directors of BRPA as set forth therein, to serve in such
positions effective immediately after the Closing. If any Person listed on
Schedule 5.2 of the Company Schedules is unable to serve, the
Party appointing such Person shall designate a successor. Except
as otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and BRPA prior to the Closing,
the Parties shall take all necessary action so that all of the members of the
board of directors of BRPA and all officers of BRPA resign effective as of
the Closing unless such member or officer is included on Schedule 5.2 of the
Company Schedules.

 5.3 HSR Act.

 

 

 (a) If required pursuant to the HSR Act, as promptly as practicable,
BRPA and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) each prepare
and file the notification required of it thereunder in connection with the
Merger as soon as reasonably practicable but no later than twenty (20)
Business Days following January 14, 2021, (b) promptly and in good faith
respond to all information requested of it by the Federal Trade Commission
and Department of Justice in connection with such notification and otherwise
cooperate in good faith with each other and such Governmental Entities, (c)
each request early termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act, and
(d) submit, as soon as practicable, any other required applications or
filings pursuant to any Antitrust Laws and furnish to the other Party as
promptly as reasonably practicable all information required for any
application or other filing required to be made pursuant to any Antitrust
Law. BRPA and the Company shall substantially comply with any information or
document requests by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department
of Justice in connection with the Merger. BRPA and the Company shall (i)
promptly inform the other of any substantive communication to or from the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger and permit counsel to the other Party an
opportunity to review in advance, and each Party shall consider in good faith
the views of such counsel in connection with, any proposed written
communications by such Party to any Governmental Entity concerning the
Merger, (ii) give the other prompt notice of the commencement of any judicial
or administrative action, suit, litigation, arbitration, proceeding by or
before any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions, and (iii)
keep the other reasonably informed as to the status of any such action. Each
Party agrees to provide, to the extent permitted by the applicable
Governmental Entity, the other Party and its counsel the opportunity, on
reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive meetings or
discussions, either in person or by telephone, between such Party and/or any
of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with the Merger;
provided, neither Party shall extend any waiting period or comparable period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity
without the written consent of the other Party. Any materials exchanged in
connection with this Section 5.3 may be redacted or withheld as necessary
to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns of legal counsel
of the Company, and to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company or other competitively sensitive material; provided, that the
Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any materials
provided to the BRPA under this Section 5.3 as "outside counsel
only." Filing fees with respect to the notifications required under the HSR
Act shall be paid by the Company.

 

 

 (b) BRPA shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, acquire
or agree to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by
purchasing a portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner,
any business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire
any assets, or take any other action, if the entering into of a definitive
agreement relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or
consolidation, or the taking of any other action, would reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders or declarations of any Governmental Entities or
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period;
(ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Entity entering
an order prohibiting the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby; (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able
to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv) materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the restrictions
and obligations set forth in this Section 5.3(b) shall not apply to or be
binding upon BRPA's Affiliates, the Sponsor, their respective Affiliates or
any investment funds or investment vehicles affiliated with, or managed or
advised by, BRPA's Affiliates, the Sponsor, or any portfolio company (as such
term is commonly understood in the private equity industry) or investment of
BRPA's Affiliates, the Sponsor, or of any such investment fund or
investment vehicle.

 5.4 Public Announcements. Promptly after the execution of this Agreement,
BRPA and the Company shall issue a joint press release announcing the
execution of this Agreement, the text of which has been agreed to by each of
BRPA and the Company (the "Signing Press Release"). Prior to Closing, BRPA
and the Company shall prepare a press release announcing the consummation of
the Merger hereunder ("Closing Press Release").

 

 

 5.5 Required Information.

 

 

 (a) In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement,
the Signing Press Release, the Closing Press Release, each Current Report on
Form 8-K proposed to be filed or furnished by BRPA under the Exchange Act
relating to or in connection with the Transactions, each document required to
be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 425 promulgated under the Securities
Act or Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or any other
statement, filing, notice, or application (other than pursuant to the HSR
Act, for which Section 5.3 applies) made by or on behalf of BRPA or the
Company to any Governmental Entity or other third party in connection with
Merger or otherwise, or any press release or Form 8-K relating to the
business or financial condition of BRPA or the Company (other than regularly
released factual, non-forward-looking business information of the Company)
(each, a "Reviewable Document"), each of BRPA and the Company shall, upon
request by the other, use reasonable best efforts (subject to applicable
Legal Requirements and contractual restrictions) to promptly furnish the
other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, and
each of their and their Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers, and
stockholders (including the directors of BRPA to be elected effective as of
the Closing pursuant to Section 5.1(f) hereof) and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Merger and
the preparation of such Reviewable Document.

 

 

 (b) At a reasonable time prior to the filing, furnishing, issuance,
or other submission or public disclosure of a Reviewable Document by BRPA or
the Company, the other Parties shall each be given a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon such Reviewable Document and give its consent to
the form thereof, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned,
or delayed, and each Party shall accept and incorporate all reasonable
comments from the other Party to any such Reviewable Document prior to
filing, furnishing, issuance, submission or disclosure thereof.

 

 

 (c) Any language included in a Reviewable Document that reflects
the comments of the reviewing Party, as well as any text as to which the
reviewing Party has not commented upon after being given a reasonable
opportunity to comment, shall be deemed to have been approved by the
reviewing Party and may henceforth be used by the other Party in other
Reviewable Documents and in other documents distributed by the other Party in
connection with the Merger without further review or consent of the
reviewing Party.

 

 

 (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and BRPA shall notify each
other as promptly as reasonably practicable (i) upon becoming aware of any
event or circumstance which should be described in an amendment of,
or supplement to, a Reviewable Document that has been filed with
or submitted to any Governmental Entity, and (ii) after the receipt by it of
any written or oral comments of any Governmental Entity on, or of any written
or oral request by any Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to,
any such Reviewable Document, and shall promptly supply the other with copies
of all correspondence between it or any of its representatives and such
Governmental Entity with respect to any of the foregoing filings or
submissions, in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements. BRPA and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts, after consultation with each other,
to resolve all such requests or comments with respect to any Reviewable
Document as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of any comments
of any Governmental Entity. All correspondence and communications to any
Governmental Entity made by BRPA or the Company with respect to the Merger or
any agreement ancillary hereto shall, to extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, be considered to be Reviewable Documents subject to the
provisions of this Section 5.5.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 5.6 No Securities Transactions. Neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any purchases or sales of
the securities of BRPA prior to the Effective Time without the consent of
BRPA, except as contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

 5.7 No Claim Against Trust Fund. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement, the Company acknowledges that it has read BRPA's final prospectus
dated November 20, 2017 and understands that BRPA has established the Trust
Fund for the benefit of BRPA's public shareholders and that BRPA
may disburse monies from the Trust Fund only (a) to BRPA's public
shareholders in the event they elect to convert their shares into cash in
accordance with BRPA's Charter Documents and/or the liquidation of BRPA or
(b) to BRPA after, or concurrently with, or in connection with the
consummation of a Business Combination. The Company further acknowledges
that, if the Merger, or, upon termination of this Agreement, another Business
Combination, is not consummated by December 23, 2020, or such later date as
shall be set forth in an amendment to BRPA's Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of extending the
date by which BRPA must complete a Business Combination, BRPA will
be obligated to return to its shareholders the amounts being held in the
Trust Fund. Accordingly, the Company, for itself and the Company
Stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Representatives, Subsidiaries,
and Affiliates, hereby waives all rights, title, interest or claim of any
kind against BRPA to collect from the Trust Fund any monies that may be owed
to them by BRPA for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to
a breach of this Agreement by BRPA or any negotiations, agreements
or understandings with BRPA (whether in the past, present or future), and
will not seek recourse against the Trust Fund at any time for any reason
whatsoever; provided that nothing herein shall amend, limit, alter, change,
supersede or otherwise modify the right of the Company to bring any action
or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (including, without limitation, the right to compel
specific performance by BRPA and Merger Sub of their respective
obligations under this Agreement). This paragraph will survive
this Agreement and will not expire and will not be altered in any
way without the express written consent of BRPA.

 

 

 5.8 Disclosure of Certain Matters. Each of BRPA and the Company will
provide the other with prompt written notice of any event, development or
condition of which it obtains knowledge during the Interim Period that (a)
gives such Party any reasonable basis to believe that any of the conditions
to the obligations of the other Party set forth in Article VI will not
be satisfied;  provided,  however, that no such notice shall be deemed to
cure breach of this Agreement or (b) would require any amendment or
supplement to the Registration Statement.

 

 

 5.9 Securities Listing. BRPA shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep
the BRPA Common Stock listed for trading on Nasdaq from the date hereof and
through the Closing. BRPA shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
BRPA Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Transactions (including
the Earnout Shares) to have been approved for listing on Nasdaq as promptly
as practicable following the issuance thereof, subject only to official
notice of issuance thereof and the requirement to have a sufficient number
of round lot holders, prior to the Closing Date.

 5.10 Charter Protections; Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance.

 

 

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, BRPA and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of BRPA, the Company and each of the
Company's Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that
BRPA, the Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been
permitted under applicable Legal Requirements and its Charter Documents
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including
the advancing of expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Legal Requirements).

 

 

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, BRPA shall,
or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in
effect directors' and officers' liability insurance covering those Persons
who are currently covered by BRPA's, on the one hand, and the Company's or
its Subsidiaries', on the other hand, directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies on terms not less favorable than the terms
of such current insurance coverage, except that in no event shall BRPA or
its Subsidiaries be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2019;
 provided,  however, that (i) BRPA may cause coverage to be extended under
the current directors' and officers' liability insurance by obtaining a six-
year "tail" policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted
or made within such six-year period, any insurance required to be maintained
under this  Section 5.10 shall be continued in respect of such claim until
the final disposition thereof.

 

 

 (c) Prior to the Closing, BRPA shall obtain directors' and officers'
liability insurance that shall be effective as of Closing and will cover
those Persons who will be the directors and officers of BRPA and its
Subsidiaries (including the directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) at and after the Closing on terms not less favorable than the
better of (i) the terms of the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance in place for the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
directors and officers and (ii) the terms of a typical directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy for a company whose equity is listed on
Nasdaq which policy has a scope and amount of coverage that is reasonably
appropriate for a company of similar characteristics (including the line
of business and revenues) as BRPA and its Subsidiaries (including
the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

 

 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this  Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on BRPA and the
Surviving Corporation and all successors and assigns of BRPA and the
Surviving Corporation. In the event that BRPA, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, BRPA and the
Surviving Corporation shall ensure that proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of BRPA or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this  Section
5.10. The obligations of BRPA and the Surviving Corporation under this
 Section 5.10 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
materially and adversely affect any present and former director and officer
of BRPA, the Company and each of the Company's Subsidiaries to whom
this  Section 5.10 applies without the consent of the affected Person.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 5.11 Insider Loans. The Company shall cause each Insider of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to, at or prior to Closing (i) repay to the Company any loan
by the Company to such Insider and any other amount owed by such Insider to
the Company; and (ii) cause any guaranty or similar arrangement pursuant to
which the Company has guaranteed the payment or performance of any
obligations of such Insider to a third party to be terminated.

 

 

 5.12 BRPA Borrowings. Until the Closing, BRPA shall be allowed to borrow
funds from the BRPA Lenders, the Sponsor, its directors, officers,
shareholders, and each of their Affiliates to meet its reasonable
capital requirements, with any such loans to be made only as
reasonably required by the operation of BRPA in due course on a non-
interest bearing basis (such aggregate amount of outstanding borrowings,
the "BRPA Borrowings"). Schedule 5.12 of the BRPA Schedules sets forth the
amount of BRPA Borrowings outstanding as of the date hereof. At the Closing,
the outstanding principal and unpaid accrued interest on BRPA Borrowings
shall be repaid pursuant to Section 5.13(e), with all amounts not so repaid
to be converted or forgiven and discharged in accordance with Section 1.12.

 

 

 5.13 Trust Fund Disbursement. Upon satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI and provision of notice to Continental in
accordance with the Trust Agreement, at the Closing, BRPA shall instruct
Continental to distribute the Trust Fund as follows: (a) first, for the
redemption of any shares of BRPA Common Stock by BRPA Stockholders in
connection with the Offer, (b) second, for income Tax or other Tax
obligations of BRPA prior to Closing, (c) third, for the payment of the
Outstanding Company Transaction Expenses and the Outstanding BRPA
Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 1.16, (d) fourth, in reimbursement
of expenses paid by directors, officers, and stockholders of BRPA, (e) fifth,
to the extent the sum of (x) the amount remaining in of the Trust Fund after
the disbursement provided by Section 5.13(a) plus (y) the Financing, if any,
exceeds $5,000,000, for the payment of BRPA Borrowings, and (f) sixth, to
distribute to BRPA the balance of the assets in the Trust Fund and net
proceeds of any financing of BRPA or for the benefit of BRPA, if any,
after payment of the amounts required under the foregoing clauses
(a) through (e).

 

 

 5.14 Tax Matters.

 

 

 (a) It is intended by the Parties that the Merger shall constitute
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The Parties
adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of U.S.
Income Tax Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a).

 

 

 (b) On or after the date hereof, none of the Parties shall take
any action, or fail to take any action, and following the Merger, BRPA shall
prevent the Surviving Corporation from taking any action or failing to take
any action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to
prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization governed by
Section 368 of the Code. The Parties will in all Returns report the Merger in
a manner consistent with such tax treatment, and no Party will take
a position inconsistent with that treatment, unless required to do otherwise
pursuant to a final determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code
(or pursuant to any similar provision of applicable state, local or foreign
Legal Requirements).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (c) Each of BRPA and the Company shall, and BRPA shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, use their respective reasonable best efforts
and cooperate with one another and Tax Opinion Counsel in order for (i) the
Company to obtain the Tax Opinion and (ii) any Tax opinions required to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Registration Statement to be
obtained. Each of BRPA and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Tax Opinion Counsel customary representation letters, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Tax Opinion Counsel, dated as of the
Closing Date or such time or times as may be reasonably requested by Tax
Opinion Counsel. The Company shall reasonably promptly notify BRPA if the
Company becomes aware of any fact or circumstance indicating that Tax Opinion
Counsel will not deliver the Tax Opinion. If Tax Opinion Counsel will not
deliver the Tax Opinion, the Company and BRPA shall cooperate and use good
faith efforts to consider and negotiate such amendments to this Agreement as
may be reasonably required in order for Tax Opinion Counsel to deliver the
Tax Opinion (it being understood that no party shall be required to agree to
any such amendment which, in the good faith judgment of such party, would
subject it to any material economic, legal, regulatory, reputational or other
cost or detriment).

 

 

 (d) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to BRPA
a certificate or certificates, duly executed and acknowledged, certifying
certain facts reasonably sufficient to establish that the Merger is not
subject to withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

 

 

 5.15 Incentive Equity Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, BRPA shall cause to
be adopted an equity incentive plan (the "BRPA Plan"), the proposed form and
terms of which shall be prepared and delivered by the Company and which shall
be reasonably acceptable to BRPA. The BRPA Plan shall provide for the
reservation by BRPA for the issuance pursuant to the BRPA Plan of a number
of shares of BRPA Common Stock as mutually agreed by BRPA and the Company
and set forth on Schedule 5.15 of the BRPA Schedules. BRPA shall file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form or
comparable form in another relevant jurisdiction) relating to BRPA Common
Stock issuable pursuant to the BRPA Plan. Such registration statement shall
be filed no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the Closing Form
8-K (or as soon as reasonably practicable after the expiration of such sixty
(60)-day period that registration of shares on Form S-8 (or any successor
form or comparable form in another relevant jurisdiction) first becomes
available to BRPA), and BRPA shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any awards
issued under the BRPA Plan remain outstanding.

 

 

 5.16 Company Stockholder Approval. As promptly as practicable after the
SEC Approval Date, the Company shall (i) seek the Company Stockholder
Approval via written consent (the "Written Consent") and (ii) in the event
the Company determines it is not able to obtain the Written Consent, the
Company shall call and hold a meeting of holders of Company Common Stock
and Company Preferred Stock for the purpose of voting solely upon
the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") as
soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC Approval Date, provided that the
Company Stockholders Meeting will occur no later than the date of the BRPA
Special Meeting. In connection therewith, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (A) establish the record
date (which record date shall be mutually agreed with BRPA) for determining
the Company Stockholders entitled to provide such Written Consent or vote in
such Company Stockholders Meeting, (B) cause the Consent Solicitation
Statement to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders in compliance with
applicable Legal Requirements and (C) solicit written consents or votes or
proxies for use at the Company Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, from the
Company Stockholders to give the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company,
acting through the Company Board, shall recommend that the Company
Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Transactions, including
the Merger (the "Company Board Recommendation") and shall include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Consent Solicitation Statement, subject to the
Company Board's compliance with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. If
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained by written consent, then
promptly following the receipt of the Written Consent, the Company will
prepare and deliver to its stockholders who have not consented the notice
required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 5.17 Third Party Consents. Each Party shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to (a) use reasonable best efforts to assemble,
prepare, and file any information (and, as needed, to supplement such
information) as may be reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as
practicable all governmental and regulatory consent required to be obtained
in connection with the Merger, (b) use reasonable best efforts to obtain all
consents and approvals of third parties that such Party or its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates is required to obtain in order to consummate the Merger, and
(c) take such other action as may reasonably be necessary or as the other
Party may reasonably request to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article
VI or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and to consummate the Merger as
soon as practicable.

 

 

 5.18 BRPA Financing. If the BRPA Board determines it is reasonably
necessary solely to meet Nasdaq listing standards or the SEC net tangible
asset test (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the
Exchange Act), BRPA may, upon the written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), arrange
and obtain up to a maximum of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) in
financing from the sale of BRPA Common Stock at a price per share of no
less than $10.00 ("Financing"). Such Financing may be made contingent upon
Closing. If BRPA elects to arrange and obtain Financing, upon reasonable
advance notice to the Company, the Company shall (i) furnish, or cause to be
furnished, to any Financing sources such information regarding the Company
as may be reasonably requested, (ii) cause the Company's management team,
with appropriate seniority and expertise, to participate in meetings,
presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and
meetings with prospective Financing sources, (iii) prepare offering documents
and other marketing materials of a type customarily used for the type
of financing proposed and cooperate with marketing efforts for the Financing
as reasonably requested, and (iv) execute and deliver definitive documents
related to the Financing; provided, in each case in clauses (i) through (iv)
above, that nothing in this Section 5.18 shall require any efforts to the
extent that such efforts would reasonably be expected to conflict with or
violate any Legal Requirement, or result in the material contravention
of, or result in a material violation or breach of, or material
default under, any Material Company Contract.

 

 

 5.19 Employment Agreements. Prior to the Closing, BRPA shall enter into
employment agreements with the Company executives listed on Schedule 5.19 of
the Company Schedules, in a form which is reasonably acceptable to the
Company and such executives.

 

 

 5.20 Termination of Company Stockholder Agreements. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall terminate each Company Stockholder Agreement.

 

 

 5.21 Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Prior to the Closing, the BRPA Board
or an appropriate committee thereof shall take all such steps as may be
required to adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of
the SEC so that the acquisition of BRPA Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement by any officer or director of BRPA or any person who is expected to
become a director or officer (as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange
Act) of BRPA for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder will be an exempt transaction under such rules and
regulations.

 

 

 5.22 Extension. BRPA shall take all actions necessary to obtain the
approval of the BRPA Stockholders to extend the deadline for BRPA to
consummate its initial Business Combination beyond December 23, 2020 to April
23, 2021 (such extension, the "Extension", and such approval of the BRPA
Stockholders of the Extension, the "Extension Approval").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 5.23 Company Support Agreements. On or before the earlier to occur of (x)
one day prior to the date the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or
(y) January 14, 2021, the Company shall deliver to BRPA the Support
Agreements, pursuant to which each of the Supporting Stockholders party
thereto has agreed to, among other things, vote all of the shares of Company
Stock beneficially owned by such Supporting Stockholder in favor of the
Merger and the other Transactions including the conversion of the
Supporting Stockholder's Company Preferred Stock, if any, contemplated by
Section 1.3(a) (which vote may be accomplished by executing a written
consent) (all of the Supporting Stockholders that are party to the Support
Agreements delivered in accordance with this Section 5.23,
the "Requisite Stockholders"). The affirmative vote of the Requisite
Stockholders to approve and adopt this Agreement and to approve the
Transactions will be sufficient to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.

the Closing:

 

 

 (a) by mutual written agreement of BRPA and the Company at any time;

 

 

 (b) by written notice from either BRPA or the Company to the other if
the Merger shall not have been consummated by April 23, 2021
(the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any
Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date;

 

 

 (c) by written notice from either BRPA or the Company to the other if
a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree, judgment or ruling
or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which order,
decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;

 

 

 (d) by written notice from the Company to BRPA if there is any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of BRPA
set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in Section
6.02(a) and Section 6.02(b) would not be satisfied at the Closing (a
"Terminating BRPA Breach"), except that, if any such Terminating BRPA Breach
is curable by BRPA through the exercise of its commercially reasonable
efforts, then, for a period of up to 30 days (or any shorter period of the
time that remains between the date the Company provides written notice of
such violation or breach and the Outside Date) after receipt by BRPA
of notice from the Company of such breach, but only as long as
BRPA continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
Terminating Company Breach (the "BRPA Cure Period"), such termination shall
not be effective, and such termination shall become effective only if the
Terminating BRPA Breach is not cured within the BRPA Cure Period (it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(d) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or
if such Terminating BRPA Breach is cured during such thirty
(30)-day period);

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

63

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (e) by written notice from BRPA to the Company if there is any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company set forth in this Agreement, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.03(a) and Section 6.03(b) would not be satisfied at the
Closing (a "Terminating Company Breach"), except that, if any such
Terminating Company Breach is curable by the Company through the exercise of
its commercially reasonable efforts, then, for a period of up to 30 days (or
any shorter period of the time that remains between the date the Company
provides written notice of such violation or breach and the Outside Date)
after receipt by the Company of notice from BRPA of such breach, but only as
long as the Company continues to exercise such commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such Terminating Company Breach (the "Company
Cure Period"), such termination shall not be effective, and such termination
shall become effective only if the Terminating Company Breach is not cured
within the Company Cure Period (it being understood that BRPA may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) if it shall
have materially breached this Agreement or if such Terminating
Company Breach is cured during such thirty (30)-day period);

 

 

 (f) by written notice from either BRPA or the Company to the other, if
the BRPA Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the BRPA Special Meeting
(including any adjournments thereof);

 

 

 (g) by written notice from either BRPA or the Company to the other if
the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained within thirty (30)
days following the date that the Consent Solicitation Statement is
disseminated to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 5.16;

 

 

 (h) by written notice from the Company to BRPA prior to obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, subject to the
terms and conditions of Section 4.4(d);

 

 

 (i) by written notice from the Company to BRPA if the Extension
Approval is not obtained by December 24, 2020; or

 

 

 (j) by written notice from either BRPA or the Company to the other if
the shares of BRPA Common Stock are delisted from Nasdaq.

 

 

 7.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.

 

 

 (a) Any termination of this Agreement under Section 7.1 above will be
effective immediately upon (or, if the termination is pursuant to Section
7.1(d) or Section 7.1(e) in accordance with the terms thereof) the delivery
of written notice of the terminating Party to the other Parties.

 

 

 (b) Termination Fee.

 

 

 (i) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(h), then the Company shall pay, within
three (3) Business Day of the notice of such termination of this Agreement, a
termination fee to BRPA in an amount equal to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) ("Termination Fee") in immediately available funds as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 (ii) The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the Termination Fee,
if, as and when required pursuant to Section 7.2(b), shall not constitute a
penalty but will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will
compensate BRPA in the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one (1) occasion. Each of the Company, BRPA and Merger Sub acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without
these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement.

 

 

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in any
circumstance in which this Agreement is terminated and BRPA is paid the
Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.2(b), the Termination Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of BRPA, Merger Sub or any of the
BRPA Related Parties against the Company or any other Company Related Party
for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
or for a breach of, or failure to perform under, this Agreement or
any certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith
or otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to
have been made in connection herewith or therewith, and upon payment of such
amounts, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or in respect of
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, whether in
equity or at law, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 

 

 (c) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and
the Merger shall be abandoned, except for and subject to the following:
(i) Sections 4.3(a), 5.7, 7.2 and 7.3, and Article VIII, shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from liability for any intentional and willful breach of this Agreement
by such Party occurring prior to such termination.

 

 

 7.3 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses.

 8.2 Interpretation. The definitions of the terms herein shall apply equally
to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context
shall require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neuter forms. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to Sections or subsections, such reference shall be to a Section or
subsection of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated the
words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of
contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Reference to the Subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such entity.

 

 

 8.3 Counterparts; Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and each other
document executed in connection with the Merger, and the consummation
thereof, may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be
considered one and the same document and shall become effective when one or
more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign
the same counterpart. Delivery by electronic transmission to counsel for the
other Party of a counterpart executed by a Party shall be deemed to meet the
requirements of the previous sentence.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 8.4 Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Ancillary Agreements and
the Exhibits and Schedules hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreement (which
will terminate at the Closing) (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties and
any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the Merger; and (b)
are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder (except as specifically provided in this
Agreement, including Section 5.10). No representations, warranties,
covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or otherwise, relating to the
Merger exist between the Parties except as expressly set forth or referenced
in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements, and the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

 

 8.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application
of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

 

 8.6 Other Remedies; Specific Performance. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.6 shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such injunction.

 

 

 8.7 Governing Law. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or
rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 8.8 Consent to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY. Any Action based
upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware; provided, that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Delaware Chancery Court, then any such legal Action may be brought in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state
court. The parties hereto hereby (a) irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for themselves and
with respect to their respective properties for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and
(b) agree not to commence any Action relating thereto except in the courts
described above in Delaware, other than Actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees
that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process
and the parties further waive any argument that such service
is insufficient. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (ii) that it or its property is exempt
or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A) the Action in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper or
(C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or
by such courts. EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

 8.9 Rules of Construction. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 

 

 8.10 Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Parties. Subject to the first sentence of this
Section 8.10, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

 

 8.11 Amendment. This Agreement and, prior to the Closing, each of the
Ancillary Agreements, may be amended by the Parties at any time only
by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties. The approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of any Party
shall not restrict the ability of the board of directors of such Party to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 or to cause such
Party to enter into an amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 8.11.

 

 

 8.12 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, any party hereto
may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such
Party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 8.13 Currency. Unless otherwise specified, all references to currency
amounts in this Agreement shall mean United States dollars.

 

 

 8.14 Schedules. The information furnished in the Schedules is arranged in
sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement, and
the disclosures in any section of the Schedules shall qualify (a)
the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) other Sections of this
Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-
reference), that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure
is also applicable to such other Sections of this Agreement. The Schedules
and the information and disclosures contained in such Schedules are intended
only to qualify and limit the representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any
way the scope of any such representation or warranty. The inclusion of any
information in the Schedules shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment that such information is material or outside the ordinary
course of business. The inclusion of any fact or information in a Schedule is
not intended to be construed as an admission or concession as to the legal
effect of any such fact or information in any proceeding between any
party and any Person who is not a party.

 

 

 8.15 Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. None of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements
in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and
other provisions, shall survive the Closing and shall terminate and expire
upon the occurrence of the Effective Time (and there shall be no liability
after the Closing in respect thereof), except for (a) those covenants and
agreements contained herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or
in part after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches
occurring after the Closing and (b) this Article VIII.

 

 

 8.16 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the Transactions may only be brought against, the entities
that are expressly named as Parties hereto, and then only with respect to
the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Except
to the extent a named Party to this Agreement (and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations undertaken by such named Party in this Agreement),
(a) no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
Representative or Affiliate of any named Party to this Agreement and (b) no
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or Representative
or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability (whether in
contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Company, BRPA or Merger Sub under this
Agreement of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

69

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to be executed
as of the date first written above.
