of Glass Shares or shares of Solstice Common Stock, GB Stock or GB II Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented by any Certificate until
such Certificate is surrendered for exchange as provided herein. Subject to
the effect of Applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of the Company Certificates representing
whole shares of Company Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, on shares of Company Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time and theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of Company Common Stock and not paid, less the amount of any
withholding Taxes which may be required thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a
record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock,
less the amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required thereon.

 



 

(e) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books or register of members, as applicable, of any Surviving Entity
of the Glass Shares or the shares of Solstice Common Stock, GB Stock or GB II
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Company or the
applicable Surviving Entity, the presented Certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged for Company Certificates and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Article 3_.

 



 

(f) No fraction of a share of Company Common Stock will be issued in
connection with the Mergers, but in lieu thereof each Person otherwise
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)(ii)_, _Section 3.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ or
_Section 3.1(d)(ii)_ will be entitled to receive, in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 3.2(f)_, from the Exchange Agent or the Company
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
pursuant to such Section by (ii) the closing price of a share of Solstice
Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") on the last full
trading day prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof and any shares of Company Common Stock) that remains
unclaimed twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Company. Any former stockholder of Solstice, Glass, GB or GB II who has not
theretofore complied with this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to the
Company for payment of their shares of Company Common Stock or cash in lieu of
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Company Common
Stock deliverable in respect of each Certificate such former stockholder or
former holder of Glass Shares holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(h) None of the Company, the Surviving Entities, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of Glass Shares or shares of
Solstice Common Stock, GB Stock or GB II Stock for any shares of Company
Common Stock or cash properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to seven (7) years after the Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Company
Common Stock or cash payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to
this _Article 3_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority), any such shares of Company Common Stock and any such
cash shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of
the Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Company, the posting by
such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Company may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of Company Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares
of Company Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(j) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by the Company on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no such investment
or loss thereon shall affect any amounts payable in respect of Solstice Common
Stock, Glass Shares, GB Stock or GB II Stock pursuant to _Article 2_ and the
other provisions of this _Article 3_. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall promptly be paid to the Company.

 



 

3.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards and Equity Plans_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Solstice and the Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee of Solstice shall take all steps necessary to (i) cause
all Solstice Options outstanding as of the date that is five Business Days
prior to the Closing Date to (the " _Option Vesting Date_ ") become vested in
full as of the Option Vesting Date (to the extent not previously vested), (ii)
with respect to any Solstice Options that became vested pursuant to _Section
3.3(a)(i)_, permit the holders of such Solstice Options to exercise such
awards on or prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) cancel, effective as of the end of the day that is three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date all Solstice Options outstanding as of
such time that have not been exercised, other than Solstice Options granted
under the Specified Solstice Plans, and (iv) cause all Solstice Options to
otherwise be treated in accordance with this _Section 3.3(a)_. Any Solstice
Option under a Specified Solstice Plan that is outstanding as of the end of
the day that is three Business Days prior to the Closing Date not be permitted
to be exercised between such time and the Effective Time and shall, as of the
Effective Time, be assumed by the Company and converted into an option (an "
_Assumed Company Option_ ") to purchase a number of shares of Company Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Solstice Common Stock
subject to such Solstice Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by (ii) the Solstice Exchange Ratio, which Assumed Company Option shall have
an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock equal to the quotient
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (x) the exercise
price per share of Solstice Company Stock of such Solstice Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Solstice Exchange Ratio.
Each Assumed Company Option shall otherwise continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions (including the vesting arrangements and
other terms

 



      
 

 



 

and conditions set forth in the applicable Solstice Stock Plan and the
Solstice Option award agreement thereunder) as are in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the Company or the Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee of the Company, as applicable, shall have any and all
amendment and administrative authority with respect to such Assumed Company
Option (subject, in the case of any amendment, to the required consent, if
any, of the affected holder of such Assumed Company Option). The assumption of
the Assumed Company Options pursuant to this 3.3(a) shall be undertaken in
accordance with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each Solstice
RSU that is then vested, by its terms (after taking into account any vesting
of the Solstice RSU that occurs by reason of the Transactions), will have been
settled in shares of Solstice Common Stock and (ii) each Solstice RSU that is
not then vested, by its terms (after taking into account any vesting of the
Solstice RSU that occurs by reason of the Transactions), as a result of the
consummation of the Transactions and settled in shares of Solstice Common
Stock shall, at the Effective Time, be assumed by the Company and shall be
converted into a new award of restricted stock units of the Company ("
_Assumed Company RSUs_ ") covering a number of shares of Company Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of (i) the
total number of shares of Solstice Common Stock then underlying such Solstice
RSU award multiplied by (ii) the Solstice Exchange Ratio. Subject to the
following sentence, each Assumed Company RSU shall otherwise continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the vesting
arrangements (and accelerated vesting arrangements) and other terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Solstice Stock Plan, the Solstice RSU
award agreement thereunder and any other Solstice Plan set forth on Schedule
4.11(a) governing such Solstice RSU) as are in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the Company or the Board of Directors or
Compensation Committee of the Company, as applicable, shall have any and all
amendment and administrative authority with respect to such Assumed Company
RSUs (subject, in the case of any amendment, to the required consent, if any,
of the affected holder of such Assumed Company RSU).

 



 

(c) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Solstice
Restricted Share that will not be vested, by its terms (after taking into
account any vesting of the Solstice Restricted Share that occurs by reason of
the Transactions), as a result of the consummation of the Transactions shall,
at the Effective Time, be converted into Company Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)(ii)_ and shall otherwise continue to have, and be subject to,
the same terms and conditions (including the forfeiture and repurchase
restrictions set forth in the applicable Solstice Stock Plan, Solstice
Restricted Share award agreement thereunder and any other Solstice Plan set
forth on Schedule 4.11(a) governing such Solstice Restricted Share) as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the Company or the
Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of the Company, as applicable,
shall have any and all amendment and administrative authority with respect to
such terms and conditions (subject, in the case of any amendment, to the
required consent of the affected holder thereof).

 



 

(d) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, Solstice
shall mail to each Person who is a holder of Solstice Options, Solstice
Restricted Shares or Solstice RSUs a letter describing the treatment of and
payment for such equity awards pursuant to this _Section 3.3_. On the Option
Vesting Date, Solstice shall further notify each holder of a

 



      
 

 



 

Solstice Option, other than Assumed Company Options, regarding the treatment
of his or her Solstice Option set forth in Section 3.3(a) in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the applicable Solstice Stock Plan. The forms of
such letter shall be provided to Glass for review and comment at least five
(5) Business Days prior to distribution and Solstice shall reflect all
reasonable comments of Glass thereon to the extent provided within three (3)
Business Days following the receipt by Glass of such forms. Solstice
acknowledges and agrees that, except as set forth in Sections 3.3(a) through
(c), no Solstice Options, Solstice Restricted Shares or Solstice RSUs will be
assumed by the Company or otherwise remain outstanding following the Effective
Time.

 



 

(e) The parties may agree to treat equity compensation held by Solstice
employees subject to non-U.S. law in a manner other than that contemplated
above in this _Section 3.3_ to the extent necessary or appropriate to take
into account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment considerations.

 



 

(f) If the Effective Time occurs on or before the "Purchase Date" relating to
the applicable "Offering Period" in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Signing Offering Period_ ") (as such terms are defined in the Solstice
ESPP) and there are options granted under the Solstice ESPP (the " _ESPP
Options_ ") then outstanding with respect to the Signing Offering Period, the
Board of Directors of Solstice shall, prior to the Effective Time, take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to provide for a New Purchase Date (as
defined in the Solstice ESPP) for the Signing Offering Period in accordance
with Section 18.2 of the Solstice ESPP. Each holder of an ESPP Option will
receive notice of the New Purchase Date, and each ESPP Option shall be
automatically exercised on the New Purchase Date, pursuant to the terms of
Section 18.2 of the Solstice ESPP. If the Effective Time occurs after the
Exercise Date relating to the Signing Offering Period, the Board of Directors
of Solstice shall timely suspend the Solstice ESPP as of immediately following
the Exercise Date relating to the Signing Offering Period. All shares of
Solstice Common Stock due upon exercise of ESPP Options will be issued prior
to the Effective Time and no ESPP Options will be outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 



 

3.4 _Adjustment of Exchange Ratios_. If any of the Company, Solstice, Glass,
GB and GB II changes the number of shares of capital stock or shares, as
applicable, issued and outstanding as a result of a stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, combination or
exchange of shares or other similar transaction, in each case only to the
extent permitted by _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, and the record date for
such an event is on or subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to
the Effective Time, the Solstice Exchange Ratio, the GB Exchange Ratio, the GB
II Exchange Ratio and the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
pursuant to each of the Mergers, and other items dependent thereon, shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of capital stock of Solstice, GB
GB II and Glass Members, as the case may be, the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

3.5 _Rule 16b-3 Approval_. Prior to the Effective Time, Solstice and the
Company, and their respective Boards of Directors or committees thereof, shall
take all actions necessary or appropriate to cause any dispositions of
Solstice Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Solstice Common Stock) or acquisitions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the
Transactions

 



      
 

 



 

by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in no-action letters issued by the SEC
in similar transactions.

 



 

3.6 _Withholding_. Each of the Surviving Entities, Glass, Solstice, the
Company, any Subsidiary thereof and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable by it under this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law, and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including Forms W-8
or W-9, as applicable, or any similar information, from holders of Solstice
Common Stock, Glass Stockholders, OEP Glass Members and any other recipients
of payments hereunder. In the event that any amount is so deducted and
withheld, and properly remitted, such amount will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom the payment from
which such amount was withheld was made.

 



 

3.7 _Appraisal Rights_.

 



 

(a) In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of any shares of Solstice Common Stock in connection with
the Solstice Merger.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares and Dissenting Cayman Shares shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive any consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(b)(ii)_, _Section 3.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section 3.1(d)(ii)_ but shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the applicable Appraisal
Statute to a holder of Dissenting Shares or Dissenting Cayman Shares.

 



 

(c) If any Dissenting Shares or Dissenting Cayman Shares shall lose their
status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the
later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the consideration otherwise payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the
Certificate formerly representing such shares and shall not thereafter be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares or Dissenting Cayman Shares, as the case may
be.

 



 

(d) Each Glass Party shall give Solstice (i) prompt notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by any Glass Party pursuant to the applicable
Appraisal Statute, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to any Glass Party prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the applicable Appraisal Statute that relates to such demand and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. No Glass Party shall settle
or make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Solstice shall have
given its written consent to such settlement, payment or settlement offer.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SOLSTICE PARTIES**

 



 

Except (a) as set forth in the applicable section of the disclosure letter
delivered by Solstice to Glass on the date of this Agreement (the " _Solstice
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that any information disclosed in a
section of the Solstice Disclosure Letter with respect to a corresponding
Section of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to any other Section of this Agreement to the extent the applicability thereto
is reasonably apparent from the face of the disclosure), or (b) other than
with respect to _Sections 4.1_ and _4.3_ , as disclosed in the Solstice
Reports (excluding the exhibits thereto) filed by Solstice with the SEC
between December 31, 2014 and the date three (3) Business Days prior to the
date hereof (other than in any "risk factor" section of the Solstice Reports,
any disclosures in any section of the Solstice Reports designated as relating
to forward-looking statements or any other disclosures included therein to the
extent they are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature), the Solstice Parties, jointly and severally, hereby represent and
warrant to the Glass Parties as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Each Solstice Party is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware. Each Solstice Party is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign entity and is in good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in
which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary (to
the extent the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect. Each Solstice Party has all
requisite corporate (or comparable) power and authority to own, operate and
lease its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies
of the certificates of incorporation and by-laws (or comparable governing
documents) of each Solstice Party previously made available to Glass are true
and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.

 



 

4.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. Each Solstice Party
has the requisite corporate (or comparable) power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby to which it is or will be a party. The consummation by each Solstice
Party of the Transactions has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
(or comparable) action on the part of such Solstice Party, other than (a) in
the case of Solstice, (i) the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Solstice Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Solstice Common Stock entitled to vote thereon at a stockholders meeting duly
called and held for such purpose and (ii) if applicable, the approval by
Solstices stockholders of the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Transactions and any proposal related to the Solstice Merger
that is required pursuant to Rule 14a-4(b) promulgated under the Exchange Act
to be presented separately to such stockholders for approval or to be
submitted to stockholders of Solstice pursuant to applicable NASDAQ rules in
connection with the Transactions (any such proposals, the " _Solstice Merger-
Related Proposals_ ") by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present
in person or represented by proxy at a meeting duly called and held for such
purpose and entitled to vote on such matters shall be the act of the
stockholders (clauses (i) and (ii) together, the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Required Solstice Stockholder Approval_ ") and (b) in the case of Solstice
Merger Sub, the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Solstice
Merger by the Company, as Solstice Merger Subs sole stockholder, which will
be obtained by written consent and delivered to Glass immediately after the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Required Solstice Merger Sub Stockholder
Approval_ "). This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of each Solstice Party, enforceable against such Solstice Party in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors rights and general
principles of equity.

 



 

4.3 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Solstice consists of 120,000,000 shares of
Solstice Common Stock, and 5,000,000 shares of Solstice Preferred Stock. As of
May 19, 2017, (i) there were 51,586,663 shares of Solstice Common Stock
(including 2,058,354 Solstice Restricted Shares) issued and outstanding and no
shares of Solstice Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) 5,445,878
shares of Solstice Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of
outstanding Solstice Options, and (iii) 328,605 shares of Solstice Common
Stock were reserved for issuance upon settlement of outstanding Solstice
Restricted Stock Units, comprised of time-based Solstice Restricted Stock
Units and performance-based Solstice Restricted Stock Units, with the issuance
of shares of Solstice Common Stock pursuant to outstanding performance-based
Solstice Restricted Stock Units, dependent upon the satisfaction of certain
market conditions for the current and subsequent fiscal years. All issued and
outstanding shares of Solstice Common Stock (A) are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (B) were not
issued in violation of the terms of any agreement or other understanding
binding upon Solstice and (C) were issued in compliance with the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of Solstice and all applicable federal and state
securities laws, rules and regulations.

 



 

(b) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements, plans or
commitments relating to the issuance of capital stock or other equity
interests to which Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries is a party obligating
Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) issue, transfer or sell any shares
of capital stock or other equity interests of Solstice or any of its
Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or
equity interests, (ii) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription,
option, warrant, call, convertible securities or other similar right,
agreement or arrangement or (iii) redeem or otherwise acquire any such shares
of capital stock or other equity interests (including securities or
obligations convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of
capital stock or other equity interests), other than pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or, to
Solstices knowledge, otherwise with respect to the voting of the capital
stock or other equity interests of Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) A complete and correct list of all the outstanding Solstice Restricted
Shares, Solstice Options, Solstice RSUs and any other awards granted under the
Solstice Stock

 



      
 

 



 

Plans (including the grant date, the number of shares of Solstice Common Stock
subject thereto, the exercise or purchase price (if any), the settlement date
(if different than the vesting date(s)), the expiration date (if any) and any
other individual terms not otherwise specified in the forms of award
agreement) and the names of the holders thereof as of the date hereof has been
made available to Glass. Solstice has made available to Glass a copy of each
Solstice Stock Plan and the forms of awards agreement for grants of awards
thereunder (and, where not included in such forms, a description of the terms
and conditions of vesting (including any acceleration upon an acquisition,
change in control or similar transaction) for each outstanding award). All
outstanding Solstice Restricted Shares, Solstice Options and Solstice RSUs
have been granted pursuant to individual award agreements in the forms of
award agreements made available to Glass and/or filed as exhibits with the
SEC.

 



 

(e) The shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Mergers, when
issued, sold and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Glass
Stockholders and the OEP Glass Members in their respective Letters of
Transmittal, will be issued in compliance with all applicable federal and
state securities laws, rules and regulations.

 



 

4.4 _Significant Subsidiaries_. Each of Solstices Significant Subsidiaries is
a corporation or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing (where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the corporate (or comparable) power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business
and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except
for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or to be in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other securities of, or other ownership interests in, each of
Solstices Significant Subsidiaries are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by Solstice free
and clear of all Liens. There are no existing options, rights of first
refusal, conversion rights, preemptive rights, calls, puts, commitments,
arrangements or obligations of any character, including voting agreements,
proxies or similar arrangements relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other securities of, or other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary
of Solstice. Solstice does not directly or indirectly own any equity or
similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other business association or entity that
directly or indirectly conducts any activity which is material to Solstice and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The copies of Solstices Subsidiaries
certificates of incorporation, by-laws and similar governing documents
previously made available to Glass are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof. Exhibit 21.1 to Solstices Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the SEC prior to the
date hereof sets forth for each Significant Subsidiary of Solstice, its name
and jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.

 



       
 

 



 

4.5 _No Violation_. Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has
received notice or is otherwise aware that it would be with the passage of
time, in violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) the certificate
of incorporation or by-laws of Solstice, (b) the certificate of incorporation,
by-laws or comparable governing documents of any Subsidiary of Solstice, (c)
any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, Contract,
agreement, joint venture, lease, license, franchise, Solstice Permit or other
instrument or (d) any Applicable Law, except, in the case of matters described
in clauses (c) or (d), as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect. Solstice
and its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
orders, franchises and approvals of all Governmental Authorities necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Solstice Permits_
"), except where the failure so to hold would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect.
Solstice and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Solstice
Permits, except where the failure so to comply would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse
Effect. No investigation by any Governmental Authority with respect to
Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of
Solstice, threatened, other than those the outcome of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.6 _No Conflict_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery by any Solstice Party of this Agreement
nor the consummation by such Solstice Party of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms hereof will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provisions of or create any rights in favor of any other party under the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Solstice; (ii) conflict with or
result in a breach of any provisions of or create any rights in favor of any
other party under the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar
governing documents of any Subsidiary of Solstice; (iii) violate, or conflict
with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or
an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties of Solstice or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared
void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise result in a
detriment to Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, Solstice Permit,
lease, Contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to
which Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Solstice or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or
(iv) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of
any Applicable Laws, except, in the case of matters described in clauses (iii)
or (iv), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect and except in the case of
clause (iv) for the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section
4.6(b)_ below.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by any Solstice Party of this Agreement
nor the consummation by such Solstice Party of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval or authorization of,
or filing or registration with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the

filings, consents, approvals and authorization required under applicable
Antitrust Laws, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or other applicable U.S.
state securities and "blue sky" laws or the rules of NASDAQ ((i) and (ii)
collectively, the " _Solstice Regulatory Filings_ "), and listing on NASDAQ of
the Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Mergers, or pursuant to
stock options or convertible or exchangeable securities of Solstice or Glass,
except for any consent, approval or authorization the failure of which to
obtain and for any filing or registration the failure of which to make would
not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers or otherwise
prevent Solstice from performing its obligations under this Agreement and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Solstice Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Other than as contemplated by _Section 4.6(b)_ and except for the
Required Solstice Stockholder Approval and the Required Solstice Merger Sub
Stockholder Approval, no consents, assignments, waivers, authorizations or

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.7 _SEC Documents_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2014, Solstice has filed all forms, reports and
documents with the SEC that have been required to be filed by it under
Applicable Laws prior to the date hereof, and Solstice will timely file prior
to the Effective Time all forms, reports and documents with the SEC that are
required to be filed by it under Applicable Laws prior to such time (all such
forms, reports and documents, together with all exhibits and schedules
thereto, the " _Solstice Reports_ "). Each of the consolidated balance sheets
included in or incorporated by reference into the Solstice Reports (including
related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations
of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Solstice and its Subsidiaries (or such
entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders
equity included in or incorporated by reference into the Solstice Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material
respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders
equity, as the case may be, of Solstice and its Subsidiaries (or such entities
as indicated in such balance sheet) for the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (x) such exceptions as may
be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and (y) normal, recurring year-end audit
adjustments which are not material in the aggregate), in each case in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")
consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein. Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of Solstice and its Subsidiaries included in the most recent Solstice
Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement that includes such a balance
sheet, including all notes thereto, neither Solstice nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be
reflected on, or reserved against in, a consolidated balance sheet of Solstice
or in the notes thereto prepared in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

GAAP consistently applied, other than liabilities or obligations that may have
arisen in the ordinary course of business since the date of such most recent
Solstice Report and which are not and would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, on the date of the last such amendment or
superseding filing) (i) each Solstice Report complied, or will comply, as the
case may be, as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as the case may be, and the applicable rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date such
Solstice Report was or will be filed, and (ii) each Solstice Report did not,
and will not, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. True and correct
copies of all Solstice Reports filed prior to the date hereof have been
furnished to Glass or are publicly available in the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC. Solstice has made
available to Glass complete and correct copies of all material correspondence
between the SEC, on the one hand, and Solstice, on the other hand, occurring
since December 31, 2014. As of the date hereof, there are no material
outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with
respect to any of the Solstice Reports. To the knowledge of Solstice, as of
the date hereof, none of the Solstice Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC
review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation. None of
Solstices Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports, registrations,
statements or other documents with the SEC. No executive officer of Solstice
has failed to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302
or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Solstice Report, except
as disclosed in certifications filed with the Solstice Reports. Neither
Solstice nor any of its executive officers has received notice from any
Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness,
form or manner of filing of such certifications. Except as previously
disclosed in the Solstice Reports since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, Solstice and each of its officers and, to the knowledge of Solstice, each
of its directors, have been and are in compliance in all material respects
with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 



 

4.8 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against
Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Solstices knowledge, threatened
against Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, or before or
by any Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Solstice Material Adverse Effect. There
are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions, awards or orders against
Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

4.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2016, each of Solstice
and its Subsidiaries has conducted their business according to their usual,
regular and ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not
been any event that has had or would be reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Solstice Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since December 31, 2016,
neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action (or has
failed to take any action) that would require the consent of Glass under
_Section 6.1_ if taken (or failed to be taken) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

4.10 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Each of Solstice and its Subsidiaries is classified as set forth in
_Section 4.10(a)_ of the Solstice Disclosure Letter for all U.S. federal and
applicable state income Tax purposes.

 



 

(b) Each of Solstice and its Subsidiaries has properly filed on a timely basis
all material Tax Returns that it was required to file, and all such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. Except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Solstice Material Adverse Effect, each of Solstice and its Subsidiaries has
paid on a timely basis all Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, that
were due and payable. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Solstice Material Adverse Effect, the
unpaid Taxes of Solstice and each of its Subsidiaries (A) for taxable periods
through the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the financial
statements included in the Solstice Reports do not exceed the accruals and
reserves for Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the most recent balance sheet included in the financial statements
included in the Solstice Reports and (B) for taxable periods through the
Closing Date, will not exceed the reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with GAAP. All material unpaid Taxes of
Solstice and each of its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods commencing after
the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the financial statements
included in the Solstice Reports arose in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(c) All material Taxes that Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries is or was
required by Applicable Law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or
collected and, to the extent required, have been properly paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, and each of Solstice and any of its
Subsidiaries has complied with all information reporting and backup
withholding requirements in all material respects, including the maintenance
of required records with respect thereto, in connection with amounts paid to
any employee, independent contractor, creditor, or other third party.

 



 

(d) Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever been a member
of an affiliated group with which it has filed (or been required to file)
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns, other than a group of
which the common parent is Solstice. With the exceptions of customary
commercial leases or contracts that are not primarily related to Taxes entered
into in the ordinary course of business and liabilities thereunder, neither
Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has any material liability under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or similar provision
of federal, state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor,
pursuant to any contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any
Person other than Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) is a party to
or bound by any material Tax indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar
agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Solstice has made available to Glass (i) complete and correct copies of
all private letter rulings, material closing agreements, material settlement
agreements, pending ruling requests and any similar documents submitted by,
received by, or agreed to by or on behalf of Solstice or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to Taxes for all taxable periods ending on or after
December 31, 2011, and (ii) complete and correct copies of all material
agreements, rulings, settlements or other Tax documents with or from any
Governmental Authority relating to Tax incentives of Solstice or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) No examination, suit, proceeding, investigation or audit or other similar
action of or relating to any material Tax Return of Solstice or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority is currently in progress or, to the
knowledge of Solstice, threatened or contemplated. No deficiencies for
material Taxes of Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries have been claimed,
proposed or assessed in writing by any Governmental Authority. Neither
Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any
jurisdiction in which Solstice or any Subsidiary does not file a Tax Return
that the jurisdiction believes that Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries was
required to file any Tax Return that was not filed or is subject to Tax in
such jurisdiction with respect to Taxes that would be the subject of such Tax
Return. Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) waived any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to extend the period
for assessment or collection of any Taxes, which waiver or extension is still
in effect, (ii) requested any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return, which Tax Return has not yet been filed, or (iii) executed or filed
any power of attorney with any taxing authority, which is still in effect.

 



 

(g) Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any payment, is
obligated to make any payment, or is a party to any agreement, contract,
arrangement or plan that could obligate it to make any payment that may be
treated as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code
(without regard to Sections 280G(b)(4) and 280G(b)(5) of the Code) in
connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(h) Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of deduction
from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after
the Closing Date as a result of (i) any adjustments under Section 481 of the
Code (or any similar adjustments under any provision of the Code or the
corresponding foreign, state or local Tax law) due to a change in method of
accounting made prior to Closing, (ii) deferred intercompany gain or any
excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of
the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax law)
that arose prior to Closing, (iii) closing agreement as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law) executed prior to the Closing, (iv) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made prior to the Closing, (v) prepaid amount received
prior to the Closing, or (vi) any election made pursuant to Section 108(i) of
the Code prior to the Closing.

property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(l)(A)(ii) of the
Code.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any of their
predecessors) has distributed to its stockholders or security holders stock or
securities of a controlled corporation, nor has stock or securities of
Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries been distributed, in a transaction to
which Section 355 or Section 361 of the Code applies in the two years prior to
the date of this Agreement.

transaction" as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b) or a
"listed transaction" as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
301.6111-2(b)(2) or any analogous provision of state or local law. Each of
Solstice and its Subsidiaries has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns
all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial
understatement of federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the
Code.

 



 

(n) Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action, has
failed to take any action, or knows of any fact or circumstance that, in each
case, could reasonably be expected to prevent (a) the Solstice Merger from
qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code or as a
transaction that, taken together with the other Mergers, qualifies as a
transfer of property to the Company described in Section 351 of the Code; or
(b) the Cayman Merger, taken together with the other Mergers, from qualifying
as a transfer of property to the Company described in Section 351 of the Code.
Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries has any plan or intention to
cause or permit the Company to liquidate, merge, transfer all or substantially
all of the assets of, or otherwise dissolve Solstice Surviving Corporation,
Glass Surviving Corporation or GB Surviving Entity.

plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (" _Qualified Solstice
Plans_ "), the Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination,
opinion, or advisory letter with respect to such Qualified Solstice Plan and
the related trust that has not been revoked, and to the knowledge of Solstice,
no circumstances exist and no events have occurred that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Solstice
Plan or the related trust.

 



 

(c) All material contributions required to be made to any Solstice Plan by
Applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and

Affiliates maintains, contributes to, or has or has had any liability with

holds securities issued by Solstice, any of its Subsidiaries, or its ERISA
Affiliates.

the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or in connection with and during a

medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
dependents thereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, stockholder approval
of the Transactions, nor the consummation of the Transactions, either alone or
in combination with another event, will result in, cause the accelerated
vesting, funding of any amounts to a rabbi trust or delivery of, or increase
the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer,
director or consultant of Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither
Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor is Solstice or any of
its Subsidiaries otherwise obligated under, any plan, policy, agreement or

state or local Applicable Law relating to Tax).

 



 

(g) There are no pending or to the knowledge of Solstice threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted against the Solstice Plans
or any Solstice Foreign Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Solstice Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of
the Solstice Plans which would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries to any Solstice
Plan, the United States Department of Treasury, the United States Department
of Labor, or any current or former participants of such Solstice Plans.

material liability (contingent or otherwise) arising from the
misclassification of employees as consultants or independent contractors, or
from the misclassification of consultants or independent contractors as
employees.

(d) Neither the execution and delivery by any Solstice Party of this Agreement
nor the consummation by such Solstice Party of the Transactions in accordance

any rights in the Solstice Intellectual Property, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Solstice
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Solstice and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable measures
to maintain in confidence and protect the proprietary nature of all material
trade secrets and confidential information comprising a part of the Solstice
Intellectual Property. To Solstices knowledge, there has been no: (i)

condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
will, or would reasonably be expected to, nor will the consummation of the
Transactions, result in the disclosure or release of Solstice Source Code by
Solstice, any of its Subsidiaries or escrow agent(s) or any other person to

(a) Solstice and its Subsidiaries maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) that satisfy
the requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information
(financial and non-financial) concerning Solstice (including its Subsidiaries)
is made known on a timely basis to the chief executive officer and the chief
financial officer of Solstice by others within those entities. To the
knowledge of Solstice, there has not been any fraud that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in Solstices internal controls
over financial reporting.

 



 

(b) Solstice maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial
reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, and includes policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of its financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and
that its receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of its management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements.

 



 

(c) Since December 31, 2014, Solstice has not identified or been made aware of
any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Solstices ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information of Solstice and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis.

 



 

(d) Neither Solstice nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or
any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction, arrangement or relationship between or among Solstice or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act)) where the purpose or effect of such
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving
Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries in Solstices consolidated financial
statements.

 



 

4.24 _Certain Contracts_.

its Subsidiaries) or any Glass Party or a controlled Affiliate of any Glass

the giving of notice or both, would cause such a violation of or default
under), nor will the consummation of the Transactions result in any material
violation of or material default under (x) any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage or indenture to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its properties or assets is bound or (y) any Solstice Material Contract.

accurate copies of all the agreements listed in _Section 4.24(b)_ of the
Solstice Disclosure Letter have heretofore been made available to Glass.

hereof and that would be subject to disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K.

 



 

(c) There is no non-competition or other similar agreement, commitment,
judgment, injunction or order to which Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or is subject that has or would reasonably be expected to result in
the effect of prohibiting or impairing the conduct of the business of Solstice
or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. Neither Solstice nor any of
its Subsidiaries has entered into (or is otherwise bound by) any agreement
under which it is now, or following the Effective Time any Glass Party or any
Affiliate of any Glass Party (including Solstice or any of its Subsidiaries)
would be, restricted from selling, licensing or otherwise distributing any of
their respective technology or products, or providing services to, customers
or potential customers or any class of customers, in any geographic area,
during any period of time or any segment of the market or line of business,
provided, that the

provided, that the foregoing shall not include any obligations of any Glass
Party or any Affiliate of any Glass Party arising solely under agreements
entered into prior to the Effective Time by any Glass Party or any Affiliate
of any Glass Party (excluding Solstice and its Subsidiaries).

directors, officers and employees nor any other Person acting on behalf of any
of them has made any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization for the
payment of any money, or any offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of
the giving of anything in value, which would cause Solstice or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Affiliates, directors, officers or

 



      
 

 



 

employees or any other Person acting on behalf of any of them, to have
violated or be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other

 **ARTICLE 5**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE GLASS PARTIES**

 



 

Except as set forth in the applicable section of the disclosure letter
delivered by Glass to Solstice on the date of this Agreement (the " _Glass
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that any information disclosed in a
section of the Glass Disclosure Letter with respect to a corresponding Section
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to any
other Section of this Agreement to the extent the applicability thereto is
reasonably apparent from the face of the disclosure), the Glass Parties,
severally, and not jointly, hereby represent and warrant to Solstice as
follows:

 



 

5.1 _Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority_. Each Glass Party is an
entity duly organized or incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation. Each
Glass Party is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in
good standing under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good standing"
concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United
States), except where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse
Effect. Each Glass Party has all requisite corporate (or comparable) power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted. The copies of the certificate of incorporation or
formation, memorandum and articles of association, by-laws, operating
agreement and similar formation or governing documents and instruments of each
Glass Party (collectively, the " _Glass Organizational Documents_ ")
previously made available to Solstice are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof.

 



 

5.2 _Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements_. Each Glass Party has
the requisite corporate (or comparable) power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and all other agreements and documents contemplated
hereby to which it is a party. The consummation by each Glass Party of the
Transactions has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate (or
comparable) action on the part of such Glass Party, other than the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the applicable Merger by the holders of the
requisite majority of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
each Glass Party at a meeting duly called and held for such purpose, or the
delivery of written consents or proxies in accordance with the Glass
Stockholders Agreement and, in the case of Glass, the Companies Law
(collectively, the " _Required Glass Stockholder Approvals_ "). This Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each Glass Party,
enforceable against such Glass Party in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating
to creditors rights and general principles of equity.

 



 

5.3 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) _Section 5.3_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter sets forth a description of
the authorized capital stock of each Glass Party. The issued and outstanding
equity interests of each Glass Party consist solely of equity interests set
forth on _Section 5.3_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter, which are owned of
record by the holder identified in _Section 5.3_ of the Glass Disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

Letter and in the respective amounts set forth opposite the name of each such
holder on _Section 5.3_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter. All such issued and
outstanding equity interests (i) are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable (as applicable) and free of preemptive rights (other
than as set forth in the Glass Stockholders Agreement), (ii) were not issued
in violation of the terms of any agreement or other understanding binding upon
any Glass Party and (iii) were issued in compliance with the applicable Glass
Organizational Documents and all applicable federal and state securities laws,
rules and regulations. The Transactions, when consummated in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, will constitute a Realization Event (as defined
the Glass Charter).

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in the Glass Stockholders Agreement or as described in
the list delivered pursuant to _Section 5.3(d)_, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible securities or other
similar rights, agreements, plans or commitments relating to the issuance of
capital stock or other equity interests to which any Glass Party or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party obligating any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries
to (i) issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (ii)
grant, extend or enter into any such subscription, option, warrant, call,
convertible securities or other similar right, agreement or arrangement or
(iii) redeem or otherwise acquire any such shares of capital stock or other
equity interests (including securities or obligations convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of capital stock or other equity
interests).

 



 

(c) Except for the Glass Stockholders Agreement, there are no stockholder
agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which any
Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or, to Glasss knowledge,
otherwise with respect to the voting of the limited liability company
interests or other equity interests of any Glass Party or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) A complete and correct list of all outstanding Glass Options and any other
awards granted under the Glass Equity Plans (including the grant date, the
number of shares of Glass Stock, GB Stock and GB II Stock subject thereto, and
exercise or purchase price (if any), the settlement date (if different than
the vesting date(s)), the expiration date (if any) and any other individual
terms not otherwise specified in the forms of award agreement) and the names
of the holders thereof as of the date hereof has been made available to
Solstice. Glass has made available to Solstice a copy of each Glass Equity
Plan and the forms of awards agreement for grants of awards thereunder (and,
where not included in such forms, a description of the terms and conditions of
vesting (including any acceleration upon an acquisition, change in control or
similar transaction) for each outstanding award). All outstanding Glass
Options and other equity or equity-linked awards of any Glass Party have been
granted pursuant to individual award agreements in the forms of award
agreements made available to Solstice.

 



 

(e) _Section 5.3(e)_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list of all the outstanding Glass Profits Interests and the names of
the holders thereof.

 



 

(f) The Allocation Schedule, when delivered to Solstice pursuant to _Section
6.21_, will set forth a true, correct and complete summary of the allocation
of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Glass Mergers. Such

Documents, the Glass Equity Plans, the Glass Profits Interests and any other
equity or equity-linked award granted by any Glass Party or otherwise with
respect to any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of any Glass
Party.

 



 

5.4 _Subsidiaries_. _Section 5.4_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter sets forth a
true and correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of each Glass Party, listing
for each such Subsidiary its name, its jurisdiction of organization, its
authorized capital stock or other equity interests, its authorized capital
stock or other equity interests and the current and record beneficial owner of
such shares or interest. Each such Subsidiary is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing (where applicable) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has the corporate (or
comparable) power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly qualified
to do business and is in good standing (where applicable) in each jurisdiction
in which the ownership, operation or lease of its property or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification (to the extent the "good standing"
concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United
States), except for jurisdictions in which such failure to be so qualified or
to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of, or other ownership interests
in, each such Subsidiary are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and are owned, directly or indirectly, by a Glass Party free
and clear of all Liens. There are no existing options, rights of first
refusal, conversion rights, preemptive rights, calls, puts, commitments,
arrangements or obligations of any character, including voting agreements,
proxies or similar arrangements relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other securities of, or other ownership interests in, any such
Subsidiary. No Glass Party directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar
interest in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or other business association or entity that directly or indirectly
conducts any activity which is material to the Glass Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The copies of each such Subsidiarys
certificates of incorporation, by-laws and similar governing documents
previously made available to Solstice are true and correct and contain all
amendments as of the date hereof.

 



 

5.5 _No Violation_. No Glass Party nor any Subsidiary of any Glass Party is,
or has received notice or is otherwise aware that it would be with the passage
of time, in violation of any term, condition or provision of (a) the Glass
Organizational Documents; (b) the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or
comparable governing documents of any Subsidiary of any Glass Party, (c) any
loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, Contract,
agreement, joint venture, lease, license, franchise, Glass Permit or other
instrument or (d) any Applicable Law, except, in the case of matters described
in clauses (c) or (d), as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect. The Glass
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances, exemptions, orders, franchises and approvals of all Governmental
Authorities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses
(the " _Glass Permits_ "), except where the failure so to hold would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass
Material Adverse Effect. The Glass Parties and their respective Subsidiaries
are in compliance with the terms of the Glass

 



      
 

 



 

Permits, except where the failure so to comply would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect.
No investigation by any Governmental Authority with respect to any Glass Party
or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of Glass,
threatened other than those the outcome of which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.6 _No Conflict_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery by any Glass Party of this Agreement
nor the consummation by any Glass Party of the Transactions in accordance with
the terms hereof will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any
provisions of or create any rights in favor of any other party under the
applicable Glass Organizational Documents; (ii) conflict with or result in a
breach of any provisions of or create any rights in favor of any other party
under the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar governing documents
of any Subsidiary of any Glass Party; (iii) violate, or conflict with, or
result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties of any Glass Party or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being
declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise
result in a detriment to any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries under any
of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any loan or credit agreement, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise, Glass Permit,
lease, Contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to
which any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any
Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or
affected; or (iv) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any
provision of any Applicable Laws, except, in the case of matters described in
clauses (iii) or (iv), as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect and except in
the case of clause (iv) for the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii) of
_Section 5.6(b)_ below.

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery by any Glass Party of this Agreement
nor the consummation by such Glass Party of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms hereof will require any consent, approval or authorization of,
or filing or registration with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filings provided for in _Article 2_ and (ii) filings, consents, approvals and
authorization required under applicable Antitrust Laws, the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act or other applicable U.S. state securities and "blue sky" laws
((i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Glass Regulatory Filings_ "), and listing
on NASDAQ of the Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Mergers, or
pursuant to stock options or convertible or exchangeable securities of
Solstice or any Glass Party, except for any consent, approval or authorization
the failure of which to obtain and for any filing or registration the failure
of which to make would not prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Mergers or otherwise prevent any Glass Party from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Other than as contemplated by _Section 5.6(b)_, and except for the
Required Glass Stockholder Approvals, no consents, assignments, waivers,
authorizations or other certificates are necessary in connection with the
Transactions to provide for the continuation in

 



      
 

 



 

full force and effect of all Glass Material Contracts or for Glass to
consummate the Transactions, except where the failure to receive such
consents, assignments, waivers, authorizations or other certificates would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.7 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) _Section 5.7(a)_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter sets forth the following
financial statements (the " _Glass Financial Statements_ "): (i) the audited
consolidated balance sheet of Glass and its Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2016 and as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of income,
changes in equity and cash flows for the years ending December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Glass
and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2017, and the related unaudited
statements of operations and cash flows, respectively, for the three-month
period ended on such date (the " _Glass Most Recent Unaudited Financial
Statements_ "). Each of the Glass Financial Statements has been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with prior periods and
fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial condition
of Glass and its Subsidiaries as of its respective date and the consolidated
results of operations and stockholders equity, or cash flows, as the case may
be, of Glass and its Subsidiaries for the period covered thereby, subject, in
the case of the Glass Most Recent Unaudited Financial Statements, to the
absence of footnote disclosure and to normal, recurring end-of-period
adjustments which are, in the aggregate, not material.

 



 

(b) The financial books and records of the Glass Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries have been maintained in accordance with customary business
practices and fairly and accurately reflect, in all material respects, on a
basis consistent with past periods and throughout the periods involved, (i)
the consolidated financial position of the Glass Parties and their respective
Subsidiaries and (ii) all transactions of the Glass Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, including all transactions between any Glass Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any holder of any Glass Party,
on the other hand. Glass has not received any advice or notification from its
independent accountants that any Glass Party has used any improper accounting
practice that would have the effect of not reflecting or incorrectly
reflecting in the books and records of any Glass Party or any of its
Subsidiaries any properties, assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, equity
accounts or other accounts.

 



 

(c) Except as reflected in the Glass Most Recent Unaudited Financial
Statements, no Glass Party nor any Subsidiary of any Glass Party has any
liabilities of any nature (whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise)
that would be required to be reflected on, or reserved against in, a
consolidated balance sheet of any Glass Party or in the notes thereto prepared
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, except for liabilities that may
have arisen in the ordinary course of business since March 31, 2017 and which
are not, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Glass Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.8 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending against
any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries or, to Glasss knowledge,
threatened against any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in
equity, or before or by any Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Glass Material Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions, awards or
orders against any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since December 31, 2016, each of the Glass
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries has conducted its business in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice, and there has not been any
event that has had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Glass Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, since December 31, 2016, no Glass Party nor any
of their respective Subsidiaries has taken any action (or has failed to take
any action) that would require the consent of Solstice under _Section 6.2_ if
taken (or failed to be taken) after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

5.10 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Glass Parties and their respective Subsidiaries is classified
as set forth in _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter for all U.S.
federal and applicable state income Tax purposes.

 



 

(b) Each of the Glass Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries has
properly filed on a timely basis all material Tax Returns that it was required
to file, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all
material respects. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Glass Material Adverse Effect, each of the
Glass Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries has paid on a timely
basis all Taxes, whether or not shown on any Tax Return, that were due and
payable. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Glass Material Adverse Effect, the unpaid Taxes of each of
the Glass Parties and their respective Subsidiaries (A) for taxable periods
through the date of the most recent balance sheet included in the Glass
Financial Statements (or, in the case of the Glass Corporate Members, the most
recent balance sheet included in the financial books and records of such Glass
Corporate Member) do not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes (excluding
accruals and reserves for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on such most recent balance
sheet and (B) for taxable periods through the Closing Date, will not exceed
the reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with GAAP. All material unpaid Taxes of each of the Glass Parties
and their respective Subsidiaries for all taxable periods commencing after the
date of the most recent balance sheet included in the Glass Financial
Statements (or, in the case of the Glass Corporate Members, the most recent
balance sheet included in the financial books and records of such Glass
Corporate Member) arose in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(c) All material Taxes that the Glass Parties or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is or was required by Applicable Law to withhold or collect have
been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been
properly paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority, and each of the Glass
Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries has complied with all
information reporting and backup withholding requirements in all material
respects, including the maintenance of required records with respect thereto,
in connection with amounts paid to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, or other third party.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) Neither Glass nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever been a member of
an affiliated group with which it has filed (or been required to file)
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns, other than a group of
which the common parent is Glass. At all times since January 1, 2012, none of
the Glass Corporate Members nor any of their respective Subsidiaries is or has
been a member of an affiliated group with which it has filed (or been required
to file) consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns. With the
exceptions of customary commercial leases or contracts that are not primarily
related to Taxes entered into in the ordinary course of business and
liabilities thereunder, none of the Glass Parties nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries (i) has any liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any comparable or similar provision of federal, state, local or foreign
law), as a transferee or successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation, or
otherwise for any Taxes of any Person other than the Glass Parties or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) is a party to or bound by any Tax
indemnity, Tax sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreement, other than the
Glass Organizational Documents or similar documents with respect to
Subsidiaries of the Glass Parties.

 



 

(e) Glass has made available to Solstice (i) complete and correct copies of
all private letter rulings, material closing agreements, material settlement
agreements, pending ruling requests and any similar documents submitted by,
received by, or agreed to by or on behalf of any of the Glass Parties or any

ending on or after December 31, 2011, and (ii) complete and correct copies of
all material agreements, rulings, settlements or other Tax documents with or
from any Governmental Authority relating to Tax incentives of any of the Glass
Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) No examination, suit, proceeding, investigation or audit or other similar
action of or relating to any material Tax Return of any of the Glass Parties
or any of their respective Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority is
currently in progress or, to the knowledge of the Glass Parties, threatened or
contemplated. No deficiencies for material Taxes of any of the Glass Parties
or any of their respective Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or
assessed in writing by any Governmental Authority. None of the Glass Parties
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has been informed in writing by any
jurisdiction in which such Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries does not
file a Tax Return that the jurisdiction believes that such Glass Party or any
of its Subsidiaries was required to file any Tax Return that was not filed or
is subject to Tax in such jurisdiction with respect to Taxes that would be
subject of such Tax Return. None of the Glass Parties nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries has (i) waived any statute of limitations with respect
to Taxes or agreed to extend the period for assessment or collection of any
Taxes, which waiver or extension is still in effect, (ii) requested any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has
not yet been filed, or (iii) executed or filed any power of attorney with any
taxing authority, which is still in effect.

 



 

(g) _N_ one of the Glass Parties nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has
made any payment, is obligated to make any payment, or is a party to any
agreement, contract, arrangement or plan that could obligate it to make any
payment that may be treated as an "excess parachute payment" under Section
280G of the Code (without regard to Sections 280G(b)(4) and 280G(b)(5) of the
Code) in connection with the Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) None of the Glass Parties nor any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
required to include any material item of income in, or exclude any material
item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of (i) any adjustments
under Section 481 of the Code (or any similar adjustments under any provision
of the Code or the corresponding foreign, state or local Tax law) due to a
change in method of accounting made prior to Closing, (ii) deferred
intercompany gain or any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations
under Section 1502 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law) that arose prior to Closing, (iii) closing agreement as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) executed prior to the Closing,

Closing, (v) prepaid amount received prior to the Closing, or (vi) any

any of their predecessors) has distributed to its shareholders or security
holders stock or securities of a controlled corporation, nor has stock or

local law. Each of the Glass Parties and each of their respective Subsidiaries
has disclosed on its federal income Tax Returns all positions taken therein
that could give rise to a substantial understatement of federal income Tax
within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.

 



 

(n) None of the Glass Parties nor any of their respective Subsidiaries has
taken any action, has failed to take any action, or knows of any fact or
circumstance that, in each case, could reasonably be expected to prevent (i)
the Solstice Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code or as a transaction that, taken together with the other Mergers,
qualifies as a transfer of property to the Company described in Section 351 of
the Code, .or (ii) the Cayman Merger, taken together with the other Mergers,
from qualifying as a transfer of property to the Company described in Section

otherwise), directly or through ERISA Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Glass Plans shall not include any Glass Foreign Plan or any Multiemployer

they are not terminable on less than 60 days notice or they require payment
of severance payments in excess of $50,000 upon any termination of employment;
and (y) the term " _Glass Foreign Plan_ " shall refer to each material plan,
program or Contract that is subject to or governed by the laws of any

"), the Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable determination,
opinion, or advisory letter with respect to such Qualified Glass Plan and the

vesting, funding of any amounts to a rabbi trust or delivery of, or increase
the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any employee, officer,
director or consultant of any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries. No Glass
Party nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor is any Glass Party or any
of its Subsidiaries otherwise obligated under, any plan, policy, agreement or

which have been asserted or instituted against the Glass Plans or any Glass
Foreign Plan, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
Glass Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Glass Plans

Department of Treasury, the United States Department of Labor, or any current
or former participants of such Glass Plans.

person, other than escrow agents, and third party contractors engaged by or on
behalf of the Glass Parties or their respective Subsidiaries to develop,
modify, maintain or otherwise work with the Glass Source Code, which
contractors are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the
Glass Source Code, and the Glass Parties and their respective Subsidiaries
have taken commercially reasonable physical and electronic security measures
to prevent disclosure of such Glass Source Code. To Glasss knowledge, no
event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be
expected to, nor will the consummation of the Transactions, result in the
disclosure or release of Glass Source Code by any Glass Party, any of its
Subsidiaries or escrow agent(s) or any other person to any third party.

 



 

(h) Other than commercially reasonable protections against unauthorized use,
to Glasss knowledge, the products and services offered by any Glass Party or

by any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries do not contain any disabling
device, virus, worm, back door, Trojan horse or other disruptive or malicious
code that may or are intended to materially impair their intended performance
or otherwise permit unauthorized access to, hamper, delete or damage any
computer system, software, network or data.

 



 

(i) Each employee of any Glass Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and each independent contractor of any Glass Party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries who has contributed to the development of material Intellectual
Property on behalf of any Glass Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries
has executed a valid and binding written agreement assigning such Intellectual
Property to or otherwise vesting ownership of such Intellectual Property in

immediately following the Effective Time in accordance with the terms thereof
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(j) To Glasss knowledge, no material support, funding, resources or

respective Subsidiaries. The Glass Parties and their respective Subsidiaries
are in material compliance with all of the applicable terms of any such
support, funding, resources or assistance, and are in material compliance with
all Applicable Laws in connection therewith, including in respect of Patent

legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect immediately
following the Closing in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect prior

any Contract with any person which may result in the obligation of any Glass

with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the

5.23 _Internal Controls_.

in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or

unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand (such as any arrangement
described in Section 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act))
where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries in
Glasss consolidated financial statements.

 



 

5.24 _Certain Contracts_.

Contract during the current fiscal year or during the next fiscal year, (ii)

in any material respect, any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries from
freely engaging in any business material to the Glass Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, anywhere in the world, (iii) any

subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally and general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). None of the Glass Parties and
their respective Subsidiaries nor, to Glasss knowledge, any other party to
any Glass Material Contract is in material violation of or in material default
under (nor does there exist any condition, which, upon the passage of time or
the giving of notice or both, would cause such a violation of or default
under), nor will the consummation of the Transactions result in any material
violation of or material default under (x) any loan or credit agreement, note,

its properties or assets is bound or (y) any Glass Material Contract.

agreements listed in _Section 5.24(b)_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter have
heretofore been made available to Solstice. None of the Glass Parties and
their respective Subsidiaries has entered into any transaction with any
Affiliate of any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any person
that is a Glass Party or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of a
Glass Party) that would be subject to disclosure pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K as it would be applicable to any Glass Party if it were an SEC
reporting company, other than the transactions set forth on _Section 5.24(b)_
of the Glass Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(c) There is no non-competition or other similar agreement, commitment,
judgment, injunction or order to which any Glass Party or any of its

the Closing, provided, that the foregoing shall not include any obligations of
Solstice or any of the Solstices Affiliates arising solely under agreements
entered into prior to the Effective Time by Solstice or any of Solstices
Affiliates (excluding the Glass Parties and their respective Subsidiaries).

acting on behalf of any of them has made any offer, payment, promise to pay,

give, or authorization of the giving of anything in value, which would cause
any Glass Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Affiliates,
stockholders, members, directors, officers or employees or any other Person
acting on behalf of any of them, to have violated or be in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar Applicable Law.

determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Solstice Superior Proposal or (ii)
could reasonably be expected to result in a Solstice Superior Proposal, then
Solstice, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may,
subject to _Section 6.3(h)_, in response to such Solstice Acquisition
Proposal take the following actions, to the extent that the Board of Directors
of Solstice has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that a failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to Solstices stockholders under Applicable Law: (A)
furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Solstice
Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, prior to furnishing such information,
Solstice receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement
with provisions no less restrictive to such third party with respect to the
use or disclosure of nonpublic information than

 



      
 

 



 

the Confidentiality Agreement and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations
with the third party with respect to such Solstice Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.3_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Solstice or the Board of Directors of Solstice from, at any time prior

in response to the receipt of a written Solstice Acquisition Proposal after
the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.3_, (i) terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ in order to
enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to such Solstice
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) effecting a Solstice Change of Recommendation, if
and only if, prior to taking any of the actions described in clauses (i) or
(ii), (A) the Board of Directors of Solstice determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Solstice Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Solstice Superior Proposal, (B)
Glass shall have received written notice (the " _Solstice Superior Proposal
Notice_ ") of Solstices or of the Board of Directors of Solstice, as
applicable, intention to take such action at least four (4) Business Days
prior to the taking of such action by Solstice or the Board of Directors of
Solstice, as applicable, which notice shall include the information with
respect to such Solstice Acquisition Proposal that is specified in _Section
6.3(h)_ (to the extent not previously provided), (iii) during the four (4)
Business Days following the receipt by Glass of the Solstice Superior Proposal
Notice (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), Solstice, if requested by Glass, shall
have made its Representatives available to negotiate with Glass regarding any
revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by Glass in response to
such Solstice Acquisition Proposal, and (iv) at the end of the four (4)
Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (iii) the Board of
Directors of Solstice continues to believe, in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and after taking into
account any modifications to the terms of the Transactions that are proposed
in a written offer by Glass after its receipt of the Solstice Superior
Proposal Notice, that such Solstice Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Solstice Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Solstice directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. Any material amendment or modification to such Solstice
Acquisition Proposal prior to a Solstice Change of Recommendation shall
require a new Solstice Superior Proposal Notice and the Negotiation Period
shall be extended by an additional two (2) Business Days from the date of
receipt of such new Solstice Superior Proposal Notice (it being understood,
however, that the Negotiation Period for such Solstice Acquisition Proposal
shall not be extended more than once pursuant to this sentence).

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Solstice

Solstice Stockholder Approval, effecting a Solstice Change of Recommendation
(other than in response to the receipt or making of a Solstice Acquisition
Proposal, which shall be subject to _Section 6.3(e)_) if the Board of
Directors of Solstice determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing and if, prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors of
Solstice determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Solstice directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ that (i) Glass shall have received written notice (a " _Solstice
Board Recommendation Notice_ ") of the Board of

 



       
 

 



 

Directors of Solstices intention to take any such action at least four (4)
Business Days prior to the taking of such action by the Board of Directors of
Solstice specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances related to such
determination, (ii) during such notice period, Solstice, if requested by
Glass, shall have made available its Representatives to negotiate with Glass
to revise the terms of the Transactions and (iii) the Board of Directors of

to take such action would be inconsistent with the Solstice directors
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

vigorously contest and resist any action or proceeding, including
administrative or judicial action or proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that
restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Mergers and the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including reasonably pursuing

material divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar
matters, including material covenants affecting business operating practices,
except to the extent any such divestitures, licenses, arrangements, matters or
covenants would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Glass Parties
and Solstice, taken as a whole.

into any undertaking proposed by any Governmental Authority, without the prior
written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

 



 

6.9 _Takeover Law_. None of the parties shall take any action that would cause

rules or regulations, which such party reasonably believes constitutes
information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to
keep confidential by reason of contracts or agreements with third parties. The
parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure

(a) The Company shall (A) indemnify, hold harmless and advance expenses to all
past and present directors and officers of Solstice and its Subsidiaries (in
all of their capacities) (x) to the same extent such persons are indemnified
or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by Solstice pursuant to Solstices certificate of incorporation, by-laws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
directors and officers of Solstice and its Subsidiaries and (y) without
limitation to clause (x), to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,

officers occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions), (B) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in Solstice Surviving Corporations (or any successors) certificate of
incorporation and by-laws after the Effective Time provisions regarding

advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
contained in Solstices certificate of incorporation and by-laws, (C)
periodically advance to any such indemnitee its legal and other expenses
(including the cost of any investigation and preparation incurred in
connection therewith), subject to clause (c) of this _Section 6.14_, and

amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-appealable determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such indemnitee is not entitled thereto
and (D) cause to be maintained for a period of six years after the Effective
Time the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") maintained by Solstice
(provided that Solstice Surviving Corporation (or any successor) may
substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company or Solstice Surviving Corporation be
required pursuant to this _Section 6.14(a)_ to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Solstice for such
insurance prior to the date hereof, the amount of such annual premium being
set forth in _Section 6.14(a)_ of the Solstice Disclosure Letter; _provided_
, _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, Solstice Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a

under Solstices DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy prior to
the Closing on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the covered
persons than Solstices existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall
satisfy the provisions of this _Section 6.14(a)_. If such "tail" policy has
been obtained by Solstice prior to the Closing, Solstice Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue to honor
Solstices obligations thereunder. From and after the Effective Time, the
Company will guarantee the obligations of Solstice Surviving Corporation under
this _Section 6.14(a)_.

to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions),
(B) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the applicable Surviving
Corporations (or any successors) memorandum and articles of association or

any such indemnitee its legal and other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to
the following clause (c) of this _Section 6.14_, and subject to the providing

the event of a final non-appealable determination by a court of competent

maintained for a period of six years after the Effective Time the current DandO
Insurance maintained by Glass (provided that any Surviving Corporation (or any

coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any Surviving Corporation
be required pursuant to this _Section 6.14(b)_ to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Glass for such
insurance prior to the date hereof, the amount of such annual premium being
set forth in _Section 6.14(b)_ of the Glass Disclosure Letter; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the applicable Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. Glass may extend coverage, effective as of the Effective Time, under
Glasss DandO Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy prior to the
Closing on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the covered persons
than Glasss existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the
provisions of this _Section 6.14(b)_. If such "tail" policy has been obtained
by Glass prior to the Closing, the applicable Surviving Corporation shall
maintain such policies in full force and effect and continue to honor Glasss
obligations thereunder. From and after the Effective Time, the Company will
guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Entities under this _Section
6.14(b)_.

 



 

(c) No Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel for all indemnitees in any single claim except to the
extent that, in the opinion of independent legal counsel selected by the
indemnitee, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
representation of two or more of such indemnitees would present a conflict of
interest under applicable standards of conduct in the legal profession. No
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The obligations of the Company and the Surviving Entities under this
_Section 6.14_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.14_ applies without
the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.14_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.14_). In the event that the Company, any
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (A)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (B) transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to any
person, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of such person or entity assume the indemnification
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.14_.

 



 

6.15 _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) So long as the opinions of counsel referred to in _Sections 7.2(d)_ and
_7.3(d)_ are given, each party hereto agrees to report for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes the exchange of Glass Shares for Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Cayman Merger, taken together with the exchange of Solstice
Common Stock for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Solstice Merger, as a
transaction qualifying as a transfer of property to the Company described
under Section 351 of the Code, except as otherwise required as a result of a
final determination of a taxing authority; _provided_ , _however_ , the
parties may treat the Solstice Merger as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) None of Solstice, the Glass Parties, the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall (i) take any action, or fail to take any
reasonable action, as a result of which the exchange of Solstice Common Stock
for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Solstice Merger would reasonably be
expected to fail to qualify either as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code or as a transaction that, taken together with the other Mergers,
qualifies as a transfer of property to the Company described in Section 351 of
the Code, or (ii) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable action, as a
result of which the exchange of Glass Shares for Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Cayman Merger, taken together with the other Mergers, would reasonably
be expected to fail to qualify as a transaction qualifying as a transfer of
property to the Company described in Section 351 of the Code. Each of Solstice
and Glass shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinion of
counsel referred to in _Sections 7.2(d)_ and _7.3(d)_.

 



 

(c) The parties shall cooperate to prepare and file any Internal Revenue
Service Forms 8937 as required pursuant to Section 6045B of the Code in
connection with the Transactions. The parties agree to furnish to each other,

reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Governmental
Authority and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax.

 



 

(d) Solstice shall deliver to Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP ("
_WilmerHale_ ") and Latham and Watkins LLP (" _Latham_ ") an officers
certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Solstice
substantially in the form of _Exhibit I_ (allowing for such amendments as
counsel to Glass or counsel to Solstice deems necessary), and each of Glass,
GB and GB II shall deliver to WilmerHale and Latham an officers certificate,

 



      
 

 



 

dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of such Glass Party
substantially in the forms of _Exhibit J_, _Exhibit K_ and _Exhibit L_,
respectively (allowing for such amendments as counsel to Glass or counsel to
Solstice deems necessary) to enable WilmerHale to render the opinion described
in _Section 7.2(d)_ and Latham to render the opinion described in _Section
7.3(d)_.

 



 

6.16 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall honor, and shall
cause each Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms, all
employment and severance agreements that constitute Solstice Plans or Glass
Plans and all benefits and obligations under the other Solstice Plans and
Glass Plans, as in effect on the date hereof (or as amended thereafter as
required by the terms thereof as in effect as of the date of the Agreement, as
contemplated hereby or with the prior written consent of Solstice and Glass).
Subject to the previous sentence, no provision of this Agreement shall be
construed as a limitation on the right of the Company or any Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any of the foregoing agreements, plans and
arrangements to the extent permitted by the terms thereof and Applicable Law,
and no provision of this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any
employee, director or beneficiary that such employee, director or beneficiary
would not otherwise have under any of the foregoing agreements, plans and
arrangements. _Section 6.16_ shall not apply to persons employed outside the
United States or covered by collective bargaining or other labor agreements
(such non-U.S. employees and collectively bargained employees, the " _Excluded
Employees_ "). The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company agrees to comply
with the requirements of Applicable Law with respect to the treatment of
Excluded Employees and to honor, or to cause each Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective Time to honor, in
accordance with their terms all Solstice Plans, Solstice Foreign Plans, Glass
Plans, Glass Foreign Plans and all Collective Bargaining Agreements or other
labor agreements to which Solstice, Glass, or any of their Subsidiaries is a
party or otherwise bound and which apply to the Excluded Employees, provided
that such plans or agreements may be amended, terminated or suspended in
accordance with their terms and Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause each Surviving Corporation to, give
individuals who were employed by the Company, any Surviving Corporation or
their respective Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Affected
Employees_ ") full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
determination of the level of benefits (other than benefit accrual under a
defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements
maintained by the Company, any Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time for such Affected Employees
service with Glass or Solstice or any Subsidiary of Glass or Solstice to the
same extent recognized by Glass or Solstice immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Affected Employee shall receive a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.

 



 

(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
each Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Affected Employees under any medical or dental benefit plans that the
Affected Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time,
other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective
Time under any medical or dental benefit plan maintained for the Affected
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) to the extent
permitted by the applicable medical or dental plan, provide each Affected
Employee with credit for the year in which the Effective Time occurs for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any medical and
dental plans that the Affected Employees are eligible to participate in after
the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Solstice agrees to cause the Company to adopt or assume, prior to or as of
the Effective Time, an equity compensation plan (the "New Equity Plan")
providing for the granting of stock options and other equity-based awards to
the employees of the Company, each Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries. The New Equity Plan shall authorize a share reserve for the
grant of awards covering a number of shares of Company Common Stock as agreed
by Solstice and Glass and Solstice and Glass agree to cause the Company to
allocate a portion of such share reserve consisting of a number of shares of
Company Common Stock equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock that would be issued at Closing pursuant to the Assumed
Company Options if each such option was "net exercised" on the Closing Date
using the VWAP on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (and for the
avoidance of doubt, without any shares of Company Common Stock being withheld
to pay income, payroll or other Taxes) and (ii) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock covered by equity awards under the Solstice Stock
Plans that are assumed by the Company pursuant to Sections 3.3(b) and 3.3(c)
for grants to employees of the Glass Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries. The New Equity Plan will be in a form agreed to by Solstice and
Glass and no awards under the New Equity Plan may be made on or prior to the
Effective Time without the consent of Glass. The Company will adopt, and
Solstice agrees that, as the stockholder of the Company, it will approve the
adoption of, the New Equity Plan prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, each of Solstice and Glass shall cause the
Solstice Plans and Solstice Foreign Plans and the Glass Plans and Glass
Foreign Plans to be amended as necessary to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law so that (i) no Affected Employee who, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, was an employee of Solstice or one of its Subsidiaries shall be eligible
to participate in a Glass Plan or Glass Foreign Plan as of the Effective Time
and (ii) no Affected Employee who, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
was an employee of Glass or one of its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to
participate in a Solstice Plan or Solstice Foreign Plan as of the Effective
Time.

 



 

(f) Glass and Solstice and their respective Subsidiaries have taken or caused
to be taken all action necessary such that neither the execution of this
Agreement nor the consummation of any of the Transactions shall constitute an
event that requires the funding of any rabbi or similar trust with respect to
any Solstice Plan, Solstice Foreign Plan, Glass Plan or Glass Foreign Plan.

 



 

(g) This _Section 6.16_ is included for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective transferees and permitted assigns and does not and
shall not, except between the parties hereto, create any right in or
obligation to any Person, including any Affected Employee, any person

Glass Plan,

 



      
 

 



 

or successor or replacement plan or arrangement or any beneficiary or trustee

cause to be established or maintained any specific employee benefit plan or
other compensatory arrangement for any length of time, (ii) is intended to
create such a plan or arrangement or amend any of the foregoing, (iii) is
intended to confer upon any individual any right to employment or other
service relationship or continued employment or service relationship for any
period of time, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment
or service, or (iv) shall be construed to indicate existence of employment
relations between Company and any of its service providers (including
contractors and consultants). No Affected Employee or other current or former
employee of any of the parties or their Affiliates, including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof, or any other Person not a party to this Agreement, shall
be entitled to assert any claim (directly or as a third party beneficiary)
against Solstice, Glass, the Company, the Surviving Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates under this _Section 6.16_.

 



 

6.17 _Notification_. Solstice, Glass and each of the Glass Members shall give
prompt notice to the other of (i) any representation or warranty made by it or
him or contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect and (ii) the failure by it or him to comply with or satisfy
in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
under this Agreement.

 



 

6.18 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each of Solstice and Glass shall provide
the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense of any
litigation brought by stockholders or any holder of other securities of
Solstice or shareholders or any holder of other securities of Glass or any
Glass Corporate Member or in the name of Solstice or Glass against Solstice or
Glass, as applicable, and/or their respective directors or officers related to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
party shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising
or related to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or consent to the
same, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned of delayed), except that no such consent
shall be required for any such settlement, compromise or arrangement that
would not result in the payment by such party of any amount in excess of
$1,000,000 over and above any retention or deductible under any applicable
insurance policy.

 



 

6.19 _FIRPTA Compliance_. On or prior to the Closing Date, (i) each of GB and
GB II shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company a signed original
of a certification that the shares of their respective stock are not United
States real property interests as defined in Section 897(c) of the Code,
together with a notice to the Internal Revenue Service (which shall be filed
by the Company with the Internal Revenue Service following the Closing Date),
in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Sections 897 and 1445 of the
Code and (ii) Glass shall deliver to the Company a signed original of a
certification pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-11T(d)(2). If any

permitted to withhold from the payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement
any required withholding Tax under Section 1445 of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

6.20 _280G Vote_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, each of the Glass Parties shall submit to a stockholder vote, in a
manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of
the Code) of such Glass Party that executed any required waiver or consent to
receive all or a portion of payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the Transactions (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that, upon
stockholder approval, no payment received by such "disqualified individual"
shall be a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined
without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such vote shall establish
each such disqualified individuals right to the payment or other compensation
that, absent waiver and stockholder approval in accordance with Section 280G
of the Code, could constitute a "parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of
the Code, and each of the Glass Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any required waivers or consents from the disqualified
individuals of such Glass Party prior to the vote. In addition, each of the
Glass Parties shall provide adequate disclosure to their respective
stockholders that hold voting capital stock of all material facts concerning
all payments to any such disqualified individual that, but for such vote,
could be deemed a "parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the vote, Solstice and its counsel shall be given the right to review and
comment on all documents required to be delivered to each of the Glass
Parties respective stockholders in connection with such vote and any required
disqualified individual waivers or consents (or a form thereof), and each of
the Glass Parties shall reflect all reasonable comments of Solstice thereon to
the extent provided within three (3) Business Days following the receipt by
Solstice or its counsel of such document, waiver, or consent, as applicable.
Prior to soliciting the vote, each of the Glass Parties shall provide to
Solstice and its counsel copies of all waivers or consents executed by the
disqualified individuals of such Glass Party in connection with the vote, and
promptly following the vote, Solstice and its counsel shall be provided copies
of all documents executed by each of the Glass Parties respective
stockholders in connection with the vote. For the avoidance of doubt, if,
absent any action under this _Section 6.20_, no payment to any disqualified
individual of a Glass Party would constitute a "parachute payment" under
Section 280G(b) of the Code, such Glass Party will have no obligations to take
any actions pursuant to this _Section 6.20_.

 



 

6.21 _Allocation Schedule_. Not less than one (1) day prior to the Closing
Date, Glass shall deliver to Solstice the Allocation Schedule.

 



 

6.22 _Glass Indebtedness_. Prior to the Closing Date, Glass shall obtain and
deliver to Solstice executed payoff letters (the " _Payoff Letters_ "), to be
effective upon the Closing, from each lender of Indebtedness of Glass and any
of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Glass
Closing Indebtedness_ "). Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_, at the Closing and
on behalf of the applicable Glass Party, the Company shall pay, in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Glass Closing Indebtedness
in the amounts set forth in the Payoff Letters delivered pursuant to this
_Section 6.22_ and pursuant to wire instructions provided by Glass to
Solstice prior to the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

6.23 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Prior to the Closing Date, Glass and
Solstice will review the advisability of either (a) termination of one or more
of the existing Glass Plans or Solstice Plans intended to comply with Section
401(k) of the Code (each a "401(k) Plan") to take effect prior to the Closing
Date (a " _Plan Termination_ ") or (b) merger of the 401(k) Plans of the
Parties as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (a " _Plan Merger_
"). In the event the Parties agree to effect a Plan Termination, the Board of
Directors of either Glass or Solstice, as applicable, will adopt resolutions
for the foregoing, having first provided the other party with the form of
resolutions and obtained its approval not less than two (2) Business Days
preceding the Closing Date and the party whose 401(k) Plan is being terminated
will provide other Party with evidence that such 401(k) Plan has been
terminated pursuant to resolution of the applicable Board of Directors
prospectively adopted and effective not later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date. In the event Glass and Solstice agree to effect a
Plan Merger, the Company shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporations to
take all steps necessary or appropriate to merge the 401(k) Plans as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (or such later date agreed
between the Parties).

 _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.4(a)_ shall not be available to Glass if any Glass Party
or any OEP Glass Member, at such time, is in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement or

the time of the Solstice stockholder meeting) and (C) within 12 months after
such termination, Solstice enters into a definitive agreement in respect of a
Solstice Acquisition Proposal or consummates a Solstice Acquisition Proposal,
then Solstice shall pay Glass the Solstice Termination Amount within five (5)
Business days after (x) the date of termination in the event of a termination

the case of a Willful and Material Breach of the Voting Agreement by any Glass
Party or OEP Glass Member) shall indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the
other parties for their respective reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and
expenses of their counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other experts
and advisors as well as fees and expenses incident to negotiation, preparation
and execution of this Agreement and related documentation and stockholders
meetings and consents (collectively, " _Costs_ "), _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, upon payment by Solstice of the Solstice Termination Amount, in full, no

notwithstanding _Section 8.5(c)_ hereof, such payment shall be liquidated
damages (and not a penalty) and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the

Representatives against any Solstice Party or any of its Subsidiaries,
stockholders and Representatives with respect to the termination, event or
breach giving rise to that payment.

to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to
any party as a result of any breach or default hereunder by any other party
shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any
provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior
or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

9.11 _Incorporation of Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Solstice
Disclosure Letter, the Glass Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits and Schedules
hereto are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all purposes
as if fully set forth herein.

 



 

9.12 _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision (or part thereof) will, to
the extent possible, be modified in such a manner as to be valid, legal and
enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of the parties as
expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible, that provision
(or part thereof) will be severed from this Agreement, and in either case the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or parts
thereof) of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby. If any provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement is so broad as
to be unenforceable, the provision (or part thereof) shall be interpreted to
be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

9.13 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or if this Agreement
was otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy hereunder. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
Delaware Court without proof of actual damages and each party hereto waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Applicable Law or in equity for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach.

Permitted Transfer.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or by order of a court of
competent jurisdiction, such Equityholder shall not commit any act that is
intended to restrict or affect such Equityholders legal power, authority and

Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement and as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, such Equityholder
shall not enter into any voting agreement with any Person with respect to any

agreement that would restrict or impede its rights to exercise rights over
Shares held by other parties.

 



 

(c) Such Equityholder understands and agrees that if such Equityholder
attempts to Transfer, vote or provide any other person with the authority to
vote any of the Shares other than in compliance with this Agreement, each

establishing a quorum and, to the extent not voted by the Proxyholders, vote
(i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the
Transactions, (ii) against the approval or adoption of any proposal made in
opposition to, or in competition with, the Transactions, and (iii) against any
Glass Acquisition Proposal or any other action that is intended, or would
reasonably be expected, to result in a breach of any covenant, representation
or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of any Glass Party under the
Merger Agreement or of such Equityholder under any Transaction Document to
which such Equityholder is or will be a party or otherwise impede, interfere
with, delay, postpone, discourage or adversely affect the consummation of the
Transactions (each of (ii) and (iii), a " _Competing Transaction_ ").

 



 

(b) If such Equityholder is the Beneficial Owner, but not the record holder,
of the Shares, such Equityholder agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the record holder and any nominees to vote all of the Shares in
accordance with _Section 3(a)_.

 



 

(c) Such Equityholder shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
equity holders of each Glass Party to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve
the Transactions, and to cause the consummation of the Transactions.

 



      
 

 



 

4. _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy_. Each Equityholder hereby agrees as follows:

 



 

(a) Solely in the event of a failure by such Stockholder to vote the Shares or
otherwise comply with its obligations under Section 3, instruct nominees or
record holders to vote the Shares, or grant a consent or approval in respect
of such Shares in accordance with _Section 3_, as the case may be, such
Equityholder hereby irrevocably appoints the Company, Solstice and each of
their respective executive officers or other designees (the " _Proxyholders_
"), as such Equityholders proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution and re-substitution), and grants to the Proxyholders full
authority, for and in the name, place and stead of such Equityholder, to vote
the Shares, to instruct nominees or record holders to vote the Shares, or
grant a consent or approval in respect of such Shares in accordance with
_Section 3_ and, in the discretion of the Proxyholders with respect to any
proposed adjournments or postponements of any meeting of members or

Equityholder in respect of the Shares.

Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance
of the duties of such Equityholder under this Agreement. Such Equityholder

(e) Neither the execution and delivery by such Equityholder of this Agreement
nor the consummation by such Equityholder of the Transactions in accordance
with the respective terms of the applicable Transaction Documents, nor the
performance by such Equityholder of its obligations hereunder will: (i) if
such Equityholder is not a natural person, conflict with or result in a breach
of any provisions of or create any rights in favor of any other party under
the organizational documents of such Equityholder; (ii) violate, or conflict
with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or
an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the
performance required by, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
lease, contract or agreement to which such Equityholder is a party; or (ii)
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
Applicable Laws binding upon or applicable to such Equityholder, except, in

Equityholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Neither the execution and delivery by such Equityholder of this Agreement
nor the consummation by such Equityholder of the Transactions in accordance
with the respective terms of the applicable Transaction Documents, nor the
performance by such Equityholder of its obligations hereunder will require any
consent, approval or authorization of, or filing or registration with, any
Governmental Authority on the part of such Equityholder, other

 



      
 

 



 

than filings, consents, approvals and authorizations required under applicable
Antitrust Laws, the Glass Regulatory Filings and except for any consent,
approval or authorization the failure of which to obtain and for any filing or
registration the failure of which to make would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Glass Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially delay the performance by such Equityholder of its
obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party.

 



 

(g) Such Equityholder has not entered into any contract, arrangement or
understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation of
Solstice, the Company or any Glass Party to pay any finders fees, brokerage
or agents commissions or other like payments in connection with the
negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions
(except that, for the avoidance of doubt, Glass has retained Guggenheim
Partners to provide financial advice with respect to the Transactions).

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, such
Equityholder acknowledges and agrees that no Solstice Party nor any other
Person has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to any
Solstice Party whatsoever, express or implied, except as expressly provided in
_Section 8(a)_, including any implied representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of any information regarding any Solstice Party
furnished or made available to such Equityholder or any of its
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
Equityholder acknowledges that no representations or warranties are made with
respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect
information that may have been made available to any Equityholder or any Glass
Party or any of their respective Representatives. Such Equityholder has not
relied on any representations or warranties relating to any Solstice Party in
determining to enter into this Agreement, except for those express
representations and warranties on which such Equityholder is entitled to rely
pursuant to _Section 8(a)_.

 



 

(i) Such Equityholder understands and acknowledges that Solstice and the
Company are entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Equityholders execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
representations and warranties of such Equityholder contained herein.

 



 

7. _Termination_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the proxy granted pursuant to _Section 4_)
shall automatically terminate upon the earliest of (i) the mutual agreement of
the parties hereto, (ii) the Effective Time, and (iii) any termination prior
to the Closing of the Merger Agreement in accordance with _Article 8_
thereof.

 



 

(b) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7_, all obligations of the parties hereto shall terminate, except a party may
recover Damages caused by a Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement by
another party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement (but solely to the extent any such
breach has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing of the Mergers).

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party may (in the case of
any party that is not a natural person, by action taken by its Board of
Directors), to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

8. _Miscellaneous Provisions_.

 



 

(a) _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Reliance on Certain
Representations and Warranties of the Solstice Parties_. None of the
representations and warranties of the parties set forth in this Agreement

assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Annexes and the documents
delivered pursuant to this Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings among the parties with respect thereto (it being
understood that the other Transaction Documents shall remain in full force and

applicable, at any time before or after approval of matters presented in

parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other

recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement, the

other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall be brought and

further agrees not to commence any litigation relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions except in the Delaware Courts, waives any objection to the
laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not
to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein
has been brought in an

 



      
 

 



 

inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DEFENSE OR
OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY
PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE DELAWARE COURTS AND ANY CLAIM
THAT ANY PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 



 

(g) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in

an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof
each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the parties
hereto.

 



 

(h) _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are
for the convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

 



 

(i) _Interpretation_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (i)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include," "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (ii) "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(iii) "date of this Agreement" refers to the date set forth in the initial
caption of this Agreement; (iv) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if"; (v) the descriptive headings included herein are included
for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof; (vi) definitions
contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the
plural forms of such terms; (vii) references to a contract or agreement mean
such contract or agreement as amended or otherwise supplemented or modified
from time to time; (viii) references to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns; (ix) references to an "Article," "Section" or "Annex"
refer to an Article, Section of, or an Annex to, this Agreement; (x)
references to "$" or otherwise to dollar amounts refer to the lawful currency
of the United States; (xi) references to a federal, state, local or foreign
law include any rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued
thereunder; and (xii) references to accounting terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meaning assigned to them under GAAP. The language used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any party hereto. No summary of this Agreement
prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. If any date on which a party is required to make a payment or a
delivery pursuant to the terms hereof is not a Business Day, then such party
shall make such payment or delivery on the next succeeding Business Day. Time
shall be of the essence in this Agreement.

 



 

(j) _Waivers_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant
to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party,
or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to
any party as a result of any breach or

 



      
 

 



 

default hereunder by any other party shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by
the party taking such action of compliance with any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or
be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

 



 

(k) _Incorporation of Annexes_. The Annexes hereto are hereby incorporated
herein and made a part hereof for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.

 



 

(l) _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision (or part thereof) will, to
the extent possible, be modified in such a manner as to be valid, legal and
enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of the parties as
expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible, that provision
(or part thereof) will be severed from this Agreement, and in either case the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of (or parts
thereof) this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
If any provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision (or part thereof) shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

(m) _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or if this Agreement
was otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy hereunder. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
Delaware Court without proof of actual damages and each party hereto waives
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Applicable Law or in equity for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach.

proceeding brought against an Investor Designee by reason of the fact that

liabilities incurred by any Investor Designee are secondary), (B) the Company
and its subsidiaries shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses
incurred by any Investor Designee and shall be liable for the full amount of
all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement, in
each case, to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of

certificate of formation, bylaws, limited partnership agreement or limited
liability company agreement or comparable organizational documents of any of
the Companys subsidiaries (or any other agreement between the Company or any
of its subsidiaries and any such Investor Designee related to
indemnification), without regard to any rights such Investor Designee may have
against the Indemnitors, and, (C) the Company and its subsidiaries irrevocably
waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitors from any and all claims against
the Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any
kind in respect thereof. The Company further agrees that no advancement or
payment by an Indemnitor on behalf of an Investor Designee with respect to any
claim for which such Investor Designee has sought indemnification from the
Company or its subsidiaries shall affect the foregoing and the applicable
Indemnitor shall have a

 



      
 

 



 

right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement
or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Investor Designee against
the Company and its subsidiaries.

to be appointed and remain on all committees established by the Board of

to have a compensation committee comprised solely of two (2) or more outside
directors; (B) in the case of any committee of the Board of Directors
established to consider any transaction between any OEP Stockholder or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, each
member thereof being disinterested in the good faith determination of the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; and (C) to the extent
consistent with the foregoing clause (A), for as long as the OEP Stockholders
have the right to designate at least three (3) Directors under Section
2.1(a)(ii), at least one (1) member of each such committee shall be an
Investor Designee.

OEP Stockholders and their underlying direct or indirect members or
controlling parent entities, or general or limited partners, each of whom have
a need to know such information (each such party for purposes of this Section,
a " _Receiving Party_ ") and solely to be used in connection with the OEP
Stockholders management of their ownership of the Shares (and for no other
purpose). As a condition to sharing such Company Information to a Receiving
Party, each OEP Stockholder shall (i) require such Receiving Party to agree to
be bound by confidentiality obligations substantially similar to (and no less
restrictive than) those set forth in Section 2.3(b) as though it were a party
hereto, and (ii) advise any such Receiving Party that such Company Information
is being provided subject to limitations upon use and may include material
non-public information and that applicable securities laws impose restrictions
on trading securities when in possession of such information and on
communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in
which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person is likely to trade in such
securities. For the purposes of this section, the application of internal
policies and procedures of JPMorgan Chase and Co. regarding confidentiality
shall satisfy the conditions of sharing such Confidential Information under
this section 2.3(a).

and will not, except as permitted below, without the prior written consent of
the Company, disclose any Confidential Information; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such Receiving Party may disclose Company Information only to the extent
(and in the manner): (i) requested or required by Applicable Law or pursuant
to judicial process (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or other similar process including pursuant to regulations of any
applicable stock exchange), which such Receiving Party shall reasonably
promptly

 



      
 

 



 

notify the Company (if legally permitted) of the nature, scope and contents of
such disclosure; (ii) required pursuant to a routine examination by any
regulatory authority (including self-regulatory authority) not specifically
targeted to the Company or the Company Information, which such Receiving Party
shall, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, as applicable, (A)
reasonably promptly notify the Company of the nature, scope and contents of
such disclosure and (B) advise the applicable regulatory authority (including
self-regulatory authority) of the confidential nature of such Company
Information; (iii) used by such Receiving Partys attorneys, auditors or
professional consultants on behalf of the Receiving Party; or (vi) such
information is required to be disclosed in connection with any litigation or
disputes involving that such Receiving Party. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, with respect to each Receiving Party, the terms Confidential
Information and Company Information shall not include information which (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by such Receiving Party in violation of this Section 2.3(b), (ii)
was within such Receiving Partys possession on a non-confidential basis prior
to it being furnished or disclosed to such Receiving Party by or on behalf of
the Company, _provided_ that such Receiving Party did not know that the source
of such information was bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Company
with respect to such information, (iii) becomes available to such Receiving
Party from a source other than the Company or any of its Representatives,
_provided_ that such Receiving Party did not know at the time of receipt of
such information that the source is bound by a confidentiality agreement with,
or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the
Company with respect to such information, or (iv) is independently developed
by or on behalf such Receiving Party without use of the Confidential
Information of the Company. An OEP Stockholder shall be responsible for any
breach of this Section 2.3(b) by any such Receiving Party to whom such OEP
Stockholder provided Company Information to the same extent as if such breach
had been committed by such OEP Stockholder.

 



 

(c) The OEP Stockholders and the Company hereby agree, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any other agreement or at law or in equity, that,
to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, when the OEP Stockholders
take any action under this Agreement, in their capacity as stockholders of the
Company, to give or withhold its consent, the OEP Stockholders shall have no
duty (fiduciary or other) to consider the interests of the Company or the
other stockholders of the Company and may act exclusively in its own interest;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall in no way affect the
obligations of the parties hereto to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties covenants and agrees to take all Necessary Actions
within its control to ensure that the Charter and the Bylaws do not, at any
time, conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

2.4 _Certain Transactions_. For as long as the OEP Stockholders have a right
to designate any Investor Designees under Section 2.1(a)(ii), the Company
shall not enter into any agreement or transaction (including any Change of
Control Transaction) with any OEP Stockholder or any of its Affiliates without
obtaining the prior approval of a majority of the Independent Directors.

 



 

2.5 _Removal of Chairman_. The initial Chairman of the Board of Directors
shall serve during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on
date of the Companys first annual meeting of stockholders after the Effective
Date. The Board of Directors may elect a replacement Chairman of the Board in
connection with or following the Companys first annual meeting of
stockholders after the Effective Date, subject to the terms of this Agreement,
the Charter and Bylaws.

providing for a Change of Control Transaction; and

 



 

(ii) such date as when the OEP Stockholders no longer have a right to
designate any Investor Designees under Section 2.1(a)(ii).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.2 and Section 6.7,
the provisions of this Section III may not be terminated, amended or modified

the Company or its subsidiaries, on the other, shall in any way restrict,
prohibit or otherwise restrain

SECTION IV. _TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS_

 



 

4.1 _Transfer Restrictions_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise approved by a majority of the Independent Directors
then serving on the Board of Directors, during the period of one hundred and
eighty (180) days after the Effective Date (the " _Initial Lock-Up Period_ "),
no Stockholder may Transfer any voting Shares that it Beneficially Owns to any
Person, other than, in the case of OEP Stockholders, a Permitted Transferee or
as may be required as a result of a Regulatory Requirement.

 



 

(b) From and after the end of the Initial Lock-Up Period and until the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Effective Date, except as otherwise approved by a
majority of the Independent Directors then serving on the Board of Directors,
no Stockholder may Transfer any voting Shares that it Beneficially Owns to any
Person, other than a Permitted Transferee or, in the case of JPMorgan Chase and
Co. and its controlled Affiliates, as may be required as a result of a
Regulatory Requirement, if:

 



 

(i) such Transfer (or series of related Transfers) involves more than fifteen
percent (15%) of the then outstanding voting Shares; or

 



 

(ii) such Transferee (together with its Affiliates), to the knowledge of such
Stockholder, would Beneficially Own, after giving effect to such Transfer (or
series of related Transfers), more than fifteen percent (15%) of the then
outstanding voting Shares; _provided_ , _that_ the foregoing restriction shall
not apply to a Transfer made by such Stockholder in a block trade (without
knowledge by such Stockholder of the identity of the ultimate Transferee at
the time of such Transfer) to a broker-dealer that is instructed by such
Stockholder to comply with the Transfer restrictions of this Section IV with
respect to any subsequent Transfer by such broker-dealer to the ultimate
Transferee.

 



 

(c) Until such time as when the OEP Stockholders no longer have a right to
designate any Investor Designees under Section 2.1(a)(ii), and except as
otherwise approved by a majority of the Independent Directors then serving on
the Board of Directors, no OEP Stockholder may Transfer pursuant to Rule 144
under the Securities Act (other than in a privately negotiated sale, including
block trades) any voting Shares that it Beneficially Owns if after giving
effect to such Transfer (or series of related Transfers) such Stockholder
(together with its Affiliates), in the aggregate, would Transfer more than one
percent (1%) of the then outstanding voting Shares in any one (1) calendar
quarter. For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions in this Section 4.1(c)
do not apply to a bona fide public offering pursuant to an effective
registration statement filed under the Securities Act, including pursuant to
the Registration Rights Agreement.

 



 

(d) The restrictions in Section 4.1(b) shall not apply with respect to any
Transferee that agrees in writing to (and to cause any subsequent Transferee
to) be bound by, and comply with, the terms and conditions of Sections 3.1 of
this Agreement by executing a Joinder Agreement with respect to such Section
or, in the alternative, enters into a separate agreement with the Company (the
" _Standstill Agreement_ ") that contains standstill restrictions that are at
least as favorable to the Company as the terms of and conditions of Section
3.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms and conditions of Section 3.1

 



      
 

 



 

or the corresponding requirements of the Standstill Agreement, as applicable,
shall terminate and no longer apply with respect to any such Transferee (or
subsequent Transferee, as the case may be) upon the earlier of (i) the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Effective Date and (ii) such date as when such
Transferee (or subsequent Transferee, as the case may be) and its Affiliates,
in the aggregate, Beneficially Own not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the
then outstanding voting Shares. Upon notice given by the OEP Stockholder to
the Company that the OEP Stockholder is exploring a potential transfer of its
Shares, which notice shall be given to the Company at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the proposed Transfer, the Company shall negotiate in good faith and
use its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a customary
confidentiality agreement with any potential Transferee identified by the OEP
Stockholder to the Company and to enter a Standstill Agreement and such other
related and customary transfer documentation with a Transferee (as
applicable).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any restrictions in Section 4.1 (but subject to Section
2.4 and Section 4.2), each Stockholder shall be permitted to tender any voting
Shares it Beneficially Owns pursuant to a public tender offer made to all
holders of Shares so long as a majority of the Independent Directors then
serving on the Board of Directors has recommended to the holders of Shares
that they accept such tender offer and tender their Shares in such tender
offer.

 



 

4.2 _Change of Control Transactions_. The OEP Stockholders shall not enter
into any definitive agreement with any Person providing for a Change of
Control Transaction or participate in or in any way support, assist,
facilitate or encourage any other Person to effect or seek, directly or
indirectly, a Change of Control Transaction, including by Transferring any
Shares in connection with a public tender or similar takeover offer made to
all holders of Shares for all Shares, in each case, if as a result of such
Change of Control Transaction the OEP Stockholders or their Affiliates would
receive per Share consideration in excess of the per Share consideration to be
received by the other holders of Shares ( _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
holders of Shares are granted the right to elect to receive one of two or more
alternative forms of consideration, the foregoing provision shall be deemed
satisfied if each holder of Shares is granted identical election rights),
except as otherwise approved by a majority of the Independent Directors then
serving on the Board of Directors.

 



 

4.3 _Legend_. Each OEP Stockholder consents to the placement of the following
legend on any Certificate representing Shares:

 



 

"THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ANY OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE IS RESTRICTED BY THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF
[ ], 2017, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, AMONG CERTAIN OF THE
STOCKHOLDERS OF THIS CORPORATION AND THIS CORPORATION (THE "AGREEMENT"). A
COPY OF THE AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS
AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THIS CORPORATION."

 



 

The Company may also place stop-transfer instructions in respect of such
Shares with respect to such legend.

 



 

SECTION V. _PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS_

 



 

5.1 _Preemptive Rights_.

 



 

(a) For as long as the OEP Stockholders have a right to designate two (2) or
more Investor Designees under Section 2.1(a)(ii), each OEP Stockholder shall
have the right to purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein, its pro rata portion, calculated based on the percentage

 



       
 

 



 

of the total issued and outstanding voting Shares owned by such OEP
Stockholder immediately prior to issuance of the New Shares (" _Pro Rata
Portion_ ") of any New Shares that the Company may, from time to time, propose
to sell and issue (hereinafter referred to as the " _Preemptive Right_ ").

 



 

(b) In the event that the Company proposes to issue and sell New Shares, the
Company shall notify the OEP Stockholders in writing with respect to the
proposed New Shares to be issued (the " _New Shares Notice_ "). Each New
Shares Notice shall set forth: (i) the number of New Shares proposed to be
issued by the Company and the purchase price therefor; (ii) each OEP
Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such New Shares; and (iii) any other
material term (including, if known, the expected date of consummation of the
purchase and sale of the New Shares).

 



 

(c) The OEP Stockholders shall be entitled to exercise their right to purchase
New Shares by delivering an irrevocable written notice to the Company within
twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of any such New Shares Notice
specifying the number of New Shares to be subscribed, which in any event can
be no greater than each OEP Stockholders Pro Rata Portion of such New Shares
at the price and on the terms and conditions specified in the New Shares
Notice.

 



 

(d) If any OEP Stockholder does not elect within the applicable notice period
described above to exercise its Preemptive Rights with respect to any of the
New Shares proposed to be sold by the Company, the Company shall have one
hundred twenty (120) days after expiration of such notice period to sell such
unsubscribed New Shares proposed to be sold by the Company, at a price and on
terms no more favorable to the purchaser than those set forth in the New
Shares Notice. If the Company does not consummate the sale of the unsubscribed
New Shares in accordance with the terms of the New Shares Notice within such
one hundred twenty (120)-day period, then the Company may not issue or sell
such New Shares unless it sends a new New Shares Notice and once again
complies with the provisions of this Section 5.1 with respect to such New
Shares. A failure by any OEP Stockholder to exercise its Preemptive Rights
with respect to any of the New Shares shall not waive such OEP Stockholders
Preemptive Rights with respect to future issuances of the New Shares.

 



 

(e) Each OEP Stockholder shall take up and pay for any New Shares that such
OEP Stockholder has elected to purchase pursuant to the Preemptive Right upon
closing of the issuance of the New Shares, and shall have no right to acquire
such New Shares if the issuance thereof is not consummated.

 



 

SECTION VI. _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

 



 

6.1 _Reliance_. Each covenant and agreement made by a party in this Agreement
or in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement is material, shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the other
parties and shall remain operative and in full force and effect after the

construed so as to confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

6.2 _Amendment and Waiver; Actions of the Board_. Any party may waive in
writing any provision hereof intended for its benefit. Except as provided in
this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, or delay or omission in the
exercise of any right, power or remedy accruing to any party as a result of
any breach or default hereunder by any other party shall be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. The remedies
provided

 



      
 

 



 

for herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies that may be
available to any party at law or in equity or otherwise. This Agreement may be
amended only with the prior written consent of the OEP Majority Interest and
the Company, including the approval of a majority of the Independent
Directors. Any consent given as provided in the preceding sentence shall be
binding on all parties. Further, with the prior written consent of the OEP
Majority Interest, at any time hereafter Permitted Transferees may be made

Stockholders" or "Stockholders", as applicable, for all purposes hereunder, by

of Directors may be amended, modified or waived without the approval of such
specified number of Directors or Independent Directors or portion of the Board
of Directors, as applicable, and (b) without limitation of the foregoing, no
provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived without the
approval of a majority of the Independent Directors.

6.5 _Remedies; Severability_. It is specifically understood and agreed that
any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by any party will result in
irreparable injury to the other parties, that the remedy at law alone will be
an inadequate remedy for such breach, and that, in addition to any other legal
or equitable remedies which they may have, such other parties shall be
entitled to enforce their respective rights by bringing actions for specific
performance or injunctive relief. If any provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision (or part

case the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or
parts thereof) of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby. If any provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement is so broad as
to be unenforceable, the provision (or part thereof) shall be interpreted to
be only so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

6.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and any documents
delivered by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties with

less than two percent (2%) of the issued and outstanding Shares.

 



 

6.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 



      
 

 



 

6.9 _Successors and Assigns; Beneficiaries_. No party hereto may assign this
Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, to any
Person without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the
foregoing sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and the respective successors and permitted assigns of
the parties as contemplated herein.

 



 

6.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Specific Performance; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 



 

(a) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement, the Transactions, and the rights
and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement, the Transactions, and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware) (collectively with Delaware Court of Chancery, the "
_Delaware Courts_ "). Each of the parties hereto further agrees not to
commence any litigation relating to this Agreement or the Transactions except
in the Delaware Courts, waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. The choice of forum set forth in this Section shall not be
deemed to preclude the enforcement of any judgment of a Delaware federal or
state court, or the taking of any action under this Agreement to enforce such
a judgment, in any other appropriate jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DEFENSE OR OBJECTION IT MAY
NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE DELAWARE COURTS AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY PROCEEDING
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 6.10. NO
PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION WILL NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

 



 

6.11 _Further Assurances; Company Logo_. At any time or from time to time
after the Effective Date, the parties hereto agree to cooperate with each
other, and at the request of any other party, to execute and deliver any
further instruments or documents and to take all such further action as any
other party may reasonably request in order to evidence or effectuate the
provisions of this Agreement and to otherwise carry out the intent of the
parties hereunder. The Company hereby grants the OEP Stockholders and their
respective Affiliates permission to use the Companys and its subsidiaries
name and logo in marketing materials.

 



 

6.12 _Competitive Opportunity_. If any Stockholder or any of its Affiliates
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be an
investment or business opportunity or prospective economic or competitive
advantage in which the Company could have an interest or expectancy (a "
_Competitive Opportunity_ ") or otherwise is then exploiting any Competitive
Opportunity, then, except with respect to any Competitive Opportunity
described in the following sentence of this Section 6.12, the Company shall
have no interest in, and no expectation that, such Competitive Opportunity be
offered to it, any such interest or expectation being hereby renounced so that
each Stockholder (other than any such

 



      
 

 



 

Stockholder who is bound by any employment, consulting, non-competition or
other agreements that prohibit such actions) shall (i) have no duty to
communicate or present such Competitive Opportunity to the Company and (ii)
have the right to hold any such Competitive Opportunity for such Stockholders
(and its agents, partners or Affiliates) own account and benefit or to
recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such Competitive Opportunity to
Persons other than the Company or any Affiliate of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as the OEP Stockholders have a right to
designate an Investor Designee and to the extent that the Company identifies a
Competitive Opportunity to an Investor Designee that (i) the Investor Designee
and the OEP Stockholders did not have knowledge of prior to receipt of such
notice, (ii) the Board of Directors resolves to cause the Company to pursue,
and (iii) the Board of Directors determines the Company has or is reasonably
capable of obtaining the requisite funding to pursue, then no OEP Stockholder

ARTICLE II

 



 

 **REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

 



 

SECTION 2.01 _Demand Registration._ (a) _Registration._ Subject to the terms
hereof and of the Stockholders Agreement, at any time after the 180th day
following the Closing Date, any Stockholder or group of Stockholders holding
at least 2.5% of the outstanding Shares

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, the " _Demand Right Holders_ ") shall be entitled to make a
written request of the Company (a " _Demand_ " and any Demand Right Holders
that makes such written request, the " _Requesting Stockholders_ ") for
registration under the Securities Act of an amount equal to or greater than
the Registrable Amount (a " _Demand Registration_ ") and thereupon the Company
will, subject to the terms of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts
to effect, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the registration under the
Securities Act of:

 



 

(i) the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so requested to
register by the Requesting Stockholders for disposition in accordance with the
intended method of disposition stated in such Demand;

 



 

(ii) all other Registrable Securities which the Company has been requested to
register pursuant to Section 2.01(b), but subject to Section 2.01(g); and

 



 

(iii) all Shares which the Company may elect to register in connection with
any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 2.01, but
subject to Section 2.01(g);

 



 

all to the extent necessary to permit the disposition (in accordance with the
intended distribution methods in such request) of the Registrable Securities
and the additional Shares, if any, to be so registered.

 



 

(b) _Demands; Demand Participation._ A Demand shall specify: (i) the aggregate
number of Registrable Securities requested to be registered in such Demand
Registration, (ii) the intended method of disposition in connection with such
Demand Registration, to the extent then known, and (iii) the identity of the
Requesting Stockholder(s). Within five Business Days after receipt of a
Demand, the Company shall give written notice of such Demand to each other
Stockholder that holds any Registrable Securities. Subject to Section 2.01(g),
the Company shall include in such registration all Registrable Securities with
respect to which the Company has received a written request for inclusion
therein within ten Business Days after the Companys notice required by this
paragraph has been given (such participating Stockholders, the " _Demand
Participating Stockholders_ "). Such written notice shall include the same
information included in the written request of the Requesting Stockholder(s)
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.01(b).

 



 

(c) _Number of Demands._ The Demand Right Holders (collectively) shall be
entitled to unlimited Demand Registrations during the term of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Effective Registration Statement._ A Demand Registration shall not be
deemed to have been effected and shall not count as a Demand (i) unless a
registration statement with respect thereto has become effective and has
remained effective for a period of at least 120 days (or two years in the case
of a Shelf Registration Statement) or such shorter period in which all
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement have actually
been sold thereunder (provided that such period shall be extended for a period
of time equal to the period the holder of Registrable Securities refrains from
selling any securities included in the effective registration statement at the
request of the Company or the lead or co-managing underwriter(s) pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement), (ii) if, after it has become effective, but
before any of the circumstances in clause (i) are satisfied, such registration
statement becomes subject to any stop

 



      
 

 



 

order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or other
Governmental Authority for any reason, or (iii) if the conditions to closing
specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in
connection with such registration statement are not satisfied, other than by
reason of some act or omission by such Requesting Stockholders.

 



 

(e) _Registration Statement Form._ Demand Registrations shall be on such
appropriate registration form of the Commission as shall be selected by the
Company and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Requesting Stockholder.

 



 

(f) _Restrictions on Demand Registrations._ The Company shall not be obligated
to (i) maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement under the
Securities Act, filed pursuant to a Demand Registration, for a period longer
than 120 days (or, in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, two years),
or (ii) effect any Demand Registration (A) within 90 days of a "firm
commitment" underwritten registration in which all Stockholders holding a
Registrable Amount were given piggyback rights pursuant to Section 2.02
(subject to Section 2.02(b)) and at least 80% of the number of Registrable
Securities requested by such Stockholders to be included in such registration
statement were included, (B) within three months of any other Demand
Registration, or (C) if, in the Companys reasonable judgment, it is not
feasible for the Company to proceed with the Demand Registration because of
the unavailability of audited financial statements. In addition, the Company
shall be entitled to postpone the filing of a registration statement or the
facilitation of a registered offering (upon written notice to all
Stockholders) in the event of a Blackout Period until the expiration of the
applicable Blackout Period. The Company may not postpone the filing of a
registration statement or the facilitation of a registered offering more than
twice in any period of 12 consecutive months, except if required by Applicable
Law; _provided_ that if the Company has previously postponed the filing of a
registration statement or the facilitation of a registered offering, the
Company may not again postpone the effectiveness of such registration
statement until 30 days after the expiration of the previous postponement. If
the Company postpones the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement
for a Demand Registration, the holders of a majority of Registrable Securities
held by the Requesting Stockholder(s) shall have the right to withdraw such
Demand in accordance with Section 2.04.

 



 

(g) _Participation in Demand Registrations._ The Company shall not include any
securities other than Registrable Securities in a Demand Registration, except
(i) for Shares that the Company proposes to sell for its own account and (ii)
with the written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) of Stockholders participating in such Demand
Registration that hold a majority of the Registrable Securities in such Demand
Registration. If, in connection with a Demand Registration, the lead managing
or co-managing underwriter(s) advise(s) the Company, in writing, that, in its
opinion, the inclusion of all of the securities, including securities of the
Company that are not Registrable Securities, sought to be registered in
connection with such Demand Registration would adversely affect the
distribution of the Registrable Securities sought to be sold pursuant thereto,
then the Company shall include in such registration statement only such
securities as the Company is advised by such underwriter(s) can be sold
without such adverse effect (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") as follows and in the
following order of priority:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) first, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration by the Requesting Stockholders up to the Maximum Amount,
allocated pro rata among such Requesting Stockholders requesting such
registration on the basis of the number of such securities requested to be
included by such Stockholders;

 



 

(ii) second, Shares that the Company proposes to sell which, taken together
with the Registrable Securities under clause (i) above, do not exceed the
Maximum Amount; and

 



 

(iii) third, all other securities of the Company duly requested to be included
in such registration statement, pro rata on the basis of the amount of such
other securities requested to be included or such other method determined by
the Company, to the extent, when taken together with clause (i) and (ii) such
number of securities does not exceed the Maximum Amount.

 



 

(h) _Selection of Underwriters._ In connection with a Demand Registration, the
Requesting Stockholder(s) may elect to have Registrable Securities sold in an
Underwritten Offering. Anytime that a Demand Registration involves an
Underwritten Offering, the Requesting Stockholder(s) may select the investment
banker or investment bankers and managers that will serve as lead and co-
managing underwriters with respect to the offering of such Registrable
Securities, subject to the prior written consent of the Company, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. In connection with
any Underwritten Offering under this Section 2.01, each Demand Participating
Stockholder shall be obligated to accept the terms of the underwriting as
agreed upon between the Requesting Stockholder(s) and the lead or co-managing
underwriters on terms no less favorable to such Demand Participating
Stockholders than the Requesting Stockholders(s). In the event of a
disagreement among the Requesting Stockholders, the decision of the
Stockholder(s) holding a majority of the Registrable Securities shall govern
for purposes of this Section 2.01(h).

 



 

(i) _Demand Withdrawal._ The Requesting Stockholder or the Requesting
Stockholders (with the consent of the Requesting Stockholder(s) holding a
majority of the Registrable Securities), as the case may be, shall have the
right to withdraw a Demand in accordance with Section 2.04.

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Piggyback Rights._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof and the Stockholders Agreement, whenever the Company proposes to
register any of its securities under the Securities Act (other than a
registration by the Company (i) on a registration statement on Form S-4 or any
successor form, a registration statement on Form S-8 or any successor form or
(ii) pursuant to Section 2.01 or 2.03) (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "), the
Company shall give the Stockholders prompt written notice thereof (but not
less than ten Business Days prior to the filing by the Company with the
Commission of any registration statement with respect thereto). Such notice (a
" _Piggyback Notice_ ") shall specify, at a minimum, the number of securities
proposed to be registered, the proposed date of filing of such registration
statement with the Commission, the proposed means of distribution, the
proposed lead or co-managing underwriter(s) (if any and if known), and a good
faith estimate by the Company of the proposed minimum offering price of such
securities. Upon the written request of a Stockholder (a " _Piggyback Seller_
") (which written request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities

 



      
 

 



 

then presently intended to be disposed of by such Stockholder) given within
ten days after such Piggyback Notice is sent to such Stockholder, the Company,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities held by
Stockholders with respect to which the Company has received such written
requests for inclusion to be included in such Piggyback Registration on the
same terms and conditions as the Companys securities being sold in such
Piggyback Registration.

 



 

(b) _Priority on Piggyback Registrations_. If, in connection with a Piggyback
Registration, the lead or co-managing underwriter(s) advise(s) the Company, in
writing, that, in its opinion, the inclusion of all the securities sought to
be included in such Piggyback Registration by the Company, by others who have
sought to have Registrable Securities registered pursuant to any rights to
demand registration (other than pursuant to so called "piggyback" or other
incidental or participation registration rights described herein) (such demand
rights being " _Other Demand Rights_ " and such Persons being " _Other
Demanding Sellers_ "), by the Piggyback Sellers and by any other proposed
sellers, as the case may be, would adversely affect the distribution of the
securities sought to be sold pursuant thereto, then the Company shall include
in the registration statement applicable to such Piggyback Registration only
such securities as the Company is so advised by such lead or co-managing
underwriter(s) can be sold without such an effect, as follows and in the
following order of priority:

 



 

(i) if the Piggyback Registration is in connection with an offering for the
Companys own account, then (A) first, such number of securities to be sold by
the Company as the Company, in its reasonable judgment and acting in good
faith and in accordance with sound financial practice, shall have determined,
(B) second, Registrable Securities of Piggyback Sellers, pro rata on the basis
of the amount of such Registrable Securities sought to be registered by such
Piggyback Sellers, (C) third, other Shares of the Company sought to be
registered by the Other Demanding Sellers and (D) fourth, other shares held by
any other proposed sellers; and

 



 

(ii) if the Piggyback Registration relates to an offering other than for the
Companys own account, then (A) first, such number of Registrable Securities
sought to be registered by each Other Demanding Seller, pro rata in proportion
to the number of securities sought to be registered by all such Other
Demanding Sellers, (B) second, Registrable Securities of Piggyback Sellers pro
rata on the basis of the amount of such Registrable Securities sought to be
registered by such Piggyback Sellers, (C) third, Shares to be sold by the
Company and (D) fourth, other shares of the Company held by any other proposed
sellers.

 



 

(c) _Terms of Underwriting._ In connection with any offering under this
Section 2.02 involving an underwriting for the Companys account, the Company
shall not be required to include a holders Registrable Securities in the
underwritten offering if, after the Company consults with such holder and
considers such holders positions in good faith, such holder refuses to agree
to the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and the
lead or co-managing underwriter(s) whether secured by the Company or
otherwise.

 



 

(d) _Withdrawal by the Company._ If, at any time after giving written notice
of its intention to register any of its securities as set forth in this
Section 2.02 and prior to the time the

 



       
 

 



 

registration statement filed in connection with such registration is declared
effective, the Company shall determine for any reason not to register such
securities, the Company may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to each Stockholder and thereupon shall be relieved of its
obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with such
particular withdrawn or abandoned registration (but not from its obligation to
pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith as provided herein);
provided that any participating Demand Right Holders may continue the
registration as a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.01.

 



 

SECTION 2.03 _Shelf Registration_. (a) Subject to the terms hereof and of the
Stockholders Agreement, in connection with a Demand Registration, subject to
Section 2.03(d), and further subject to the availability of a registration
statement on Form S-3 or any successor form (" _Form S-3_") to the Company,
the Requesting Stockholder(s) making the Demand may by written notice
delivered to the Company (the " _Shelf Notice_ ") require the Company to file
as soon as practicable (but no later than 45 days after the date the Shelf
Notice is delivered and no earlier than the 180th day following the Closing
Date), and to use reasonable best efforts to cause to be declared effective by
the Commission as soon as practicable, a Form S-3 providing for an offering to
be made on a continuous or delayed basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the
Securities Act relating to the offer and sale, from time to time, of the
Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned by such Requesting Stockholder(s)
and the other Stockholders holding any Registrable Securities who elect to
participate therein as provided in Section 2.03(b) in accordance with the plan
and method of distribution set forth in the prospectus included in such Form
S-3 (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ "). In the event of a disagreement
among the Requesting Stockholders, the decision of the Stockholder(s) holding
a majority of the Registrable Securities shall govern for purposes of this
Section 2.03(a).

 



 

(b) Within five Business Days after receipt of a Shelf Notice pursuant to
Section 2.03(a), the Company will deliver written notice thereof to each
Stockholder holding any Registrable Securities. Each Stockholder may elect to
participate in the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the plan
and method of distribution set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement by
delivering to the Company a written request to so participate within ten
Business Days after the Shelf Notice is given to any such Stockholders.

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 2.03(d), the Company will use reasonable best efforts
to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the
earlier of (i) two years after the Shelf Registration Statement has been
declared effective and (ii) the date on which all Registrable Securities
covered by the Shelf Registration Statement have been sold thereunder in
accordance with the plan and method of distribution disclosed in the
prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement, or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The Company shall be entitled, from time to time, by providing written
notice to the Stockholders who elected to participate in the Shelf
Registration Statement, to require such Stockholders to suspend the use of the
prospectus for sales of Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration
Statement for any Blackout Period. Immediately upon receipt of such notice,
the Stockholders covered by the Shelf Registration Statement shall suspend the
use of the prospectus until the requisite changes to the prospectus have been
made as required below. After the expiration of any Blackout Period and
without any further request from a Stockholder, the Company shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable prepare a post-effective amendment or

 



      
 

 



 

supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or the prospectus, or any
document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable
Securities included therein, the prospectus will not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to be stated in order to make the statements made,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(e) At any time that a Shelf Registration Statement is effective, if any
Demand Right Holder delivers a notice to the Company (a " _Take-Down Notice_
") stating that it intends to sell all or part of its Registrable Securities
included by it on the Shelf Registration Statement in an Underwritten Offering
(a " _Shelf Offering_ "), then, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable amend or supplement the Shelf Registration Statement as may be
necessary in order to enable such Registrable Securities to be distributed
pursuant to the Shelf Offering (taking into account, solely in connection with
a Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering (as defined below), the inclusion of
Registrable Securities by any other holders pursuant to this Section 2.03(e)).
In connection with any Shelf Offering that is an Underwritten Offering and
where the plan of distribution set forth in the applicable Take-Down Notice
includes a customary "road show" (including an "electronic road show") or
other substantial marketing effort by the Company and the underwriters (a "
_Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering_ "):

 



 

(i) the Company shall forward the Take-Down Notice to all other holders of
Registrable Securities included on the Shelf Registration Statement and the
Company and such proposing Demand Right Holder shall permit each such holder
to include its Registrable Securities included on the Shelf Registration
Statement in the Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering if such holder notifies
the proposing Demand Right Holder and the Company within five Business Days
after delivery of the Take-Down Notice to such holder; and

 



 

(ii) if the lead or co-managing underwriter(s) advises the Company and the
proposing Demand Right Holder that, in its opinion, the inclusion of all of
the securities sought to be sold in connection with such Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Offering would adversely affect the distribution thereof, then there
shall be included in such Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering only such
securities as the proposing Demand Right Holder is advised by such lead or co-
managing underwriter(s) can be sold without such adverse effect, and such
number of Registrable Securities shall be allocated in the same manner as
described in Section 2.01(g). Except as otherwise expressly specified in this
Section 2.03, any Marketed Underwritten Shelf Offering shall be subject to the
same requirements, limitations and other provisions of this Article II as
would be applicable to a Demand Registration (i.e., as if such Marketed
Underwritten Shelf Offering were a Demand Registration), including Section
2.01(f) and Section 2.01(g).

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.03 to the contrary, the Company
shall not be required to participate in more than two Marketed Underwritten
Shelf Offerings per fiscal year.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _Withdrawal Rights._ Any Stockholder having notified or directed
the Company to include any or all of its Registrable Securities in a
registration statement under the Securities Act shall have the right to
withdraw any such notice or direction with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

any or all of the Registrable Securities designated by it for registration by
giving written notice to such effect to the Company prior to the effective
date of such registration statement. In the event of any such withdrawal, the
Company shall not include such Registrable Securities in the applicable
registration and such Registrable Securities shall continue to be Registrable
Securities for all purposes of this Agreement. No such withdrawal shall affect
the obligations of the Company with respect to the Registrable Securities not
so withdrawn; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of a Demand
Registration, if such withdrawal shall reduce the number of Registrable
Securities sought to be included in such registration below the Registrable
Amount, then the Company shall as promptly as practicable give each holder of
Registrable Securities sought to be registered notice to such effect and,
within ten Business Days following the mailing of such notice, such holder of
Registrable Securities still seeking registration shall, by written notice to
the Company, elect to register additional Registrable Securities, when taken
together with elections to register Registrable Securities by its Affiliates,
to satisfy the Registrable Amount or elect that such registration statement
not be filed or, if theretofore filed, be withdrawn. During such ten Business
Day period, the Company shall not file such registration statement or, if such
registration statement has already been filed, the Company shall not seek, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent, the effectiveness thereof. Any
registration statement withdrawn or not filed (a) in accordance with an
election by the Company, (b) in accordance with an election by the Requesting
Stockholder in the case of a Demand Registration or with respect to a Shelf
Registration Statement or (c) in accordance with an election by the Company
subsequent to the effectiveness of the applicable Demand registration
statement because any post-effective amendment or supplement to the applicable
Demand registration statement contains information regarding the Company which
the Company deems adverse to the Company, shall not be counted as a Demand.

 



 

SECTION 2.05 _Lock-up Agreements_. In connection with any Underwritten
Offering, each Stockholder agrees to enter into customary agreements to not
effect any public sale or distribution (including sales pursuant to Rule 144)
of Company Equity Securities (a) for a Public Offering (other than a Demand
Registration or Piggyback Registration), during the period between the date
specified by the Company to such Stockholder in its notice of intention to
commence a Public Offering (such date to be the Companys best estimate as to
the date that is 10 days prior to the date of the filing of the "final"
prospectus or "final" prospectus supplement if the Underwritten Offering is
made pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement, the " _Final Prospectus
Filing Date_ ") and 120 days following the Final Prospectus Filing Date or (b)
for a Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration, during the period between
the date specified by the Company to such Stockholder in its notice of
intention to commence an Underwritten Offering (such date to be the Companys
best estimate as to the date that is 10 days prior to the Final Prospectus
Filing Date) and 90 days following the Final Prospectus Filing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, the lock-up restrictions pursuant to any underwriting
agreement to be entered into with the underwriters shall not exceed the time
limits on the lock-up restrictions set forth herein without the written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)
of each Demand Right Holder. The Company also shall cause its executive
officers and directors (and managers, if applicable) and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause other holders of Shares who Beneficially Own
any of the Shares participating in such offering (including the Company, if
applicable), to enter into lockup agreements that contain restrictions that
are no less restrictive than the restrictions contained herein.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of
this Agreement nor any other

 



      
 

 



 

agreement between any of the OEP Stockholders or their Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Company or its subsidiaries, on the other, shall in any way
restrict, prohibit or otherwise restrain JPMorgan Chase and Co. and its
Affiliates from operating in the ordinary course business or engaging in their
respective ordinary course business activities, whether through its investment
banking division or otherwise.

 



 

SECTION 2.06 _Registration Procedures._ (a) _Registration._ If and whenever
the Company is required to use reasonable best efforts to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as
provided in Sections 2.01, 2.02, and 2.03, the Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable:

 



 

(i) prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement to effect
such registration and thereafter use reasonable best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become and remain effective, pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may discontinue
any registration of its securities which are not Registrable Securities at any
time prior to the effective date of the registration statement relating
thereto; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that at least five Business Days
prior to filing any registration statement or any amendments thereto, the
Company will furnish to the counsel selected by the holders of Registrable
Securities which are to be included in such registration (" _Selling Holders_
") copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents will be
subject to the review of such counsel (such review to be conducted with
reasonable promptness) and other documents reasonably requested by such
counsel, including any comment letter from the Commission, and if reasonably
requested by such counsel, provide such counsel reasonable opportunity to
participate in the preparation of such registration statement and each
prospectus included therein and such other opportunities to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act, including
reasonable access upon reasonable notice during normal business hours to the
Companys books and records, officers, accountants and other advisors, so long
as such access or request does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations
of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company shall not file such
registration statement or any amendments thereto if the Selling Holders shall
in good faith reasonably object in writing to the filing of such documents,
unless, in the good faith opinion of the Company, such filing is necessary to
comply with Applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that the Selling Holders
shall (and shall cause their representatives to) keep confidential any such
information that is not generally publicly available at the time of delivery
of such information;

 



 

(ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith as
may be necessary (A) to keep such registration statement effective, (B) to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all securities covered by such registration statement and (C)
to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to be stated in order
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, until the earlier of such time as all of such
securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition by Selling Holders thereof set forth in such registration
statement or the expiration of 120 days (or two years

 



      
 

 



 

in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement) after such registration
statement becomes effective;

 



 

(iii) if requested by the lead or co-managing underwriters, if any, or the
holders of a majority of the then outstanding Registrable Securities being
sold in connection with an underwritten offering, as promptly as reasonably
practicable include in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment
such information as the lead or co-managing underwriters, if any, and such
holders may reasonably request in order to permit the intended method of
distribution of such securities and make all required filings of such
prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as practicable
after the Company has received such request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to take any actions under this Section
2.06(a)(iii) that are not, in the good faith opinion of the Company, in
compliance with Applicable Law;

 



 

(iv) furnish to each Selling Holder and each underwriter, if any, of the
securities being sold by such Selling Holder such number of conformed copies
of such registration statement and of each amendment and supplement thereto
(in each case including all exhibits), such number of copies of the prospectus
contained in such registration statement (including each preliminary
prospectus and any summary prospectus) and each free writing prospectus (as
defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) (a " _Free Writing Prospectus_ ")
utilized in connection therewith and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424
under the Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and such other documents as such Selling Holder and
underwriter, if any, may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public
sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such Selling
Holder;

 



 

(v) use reasonable best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the
Selling Holders, the underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel in
connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such
registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement under such other securities laws or blue sky laws of
such jurisdictions as any Selling Holder and any underwriter of the securities
being sold by such Selling Holder shall reasonably request and to keep each
such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during
the period such registration statement is required to be kept effective
hereunder, and take any other action which may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable such Selling Holder and underwriter to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities owned by such
Selling Holder, except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be
required to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not, but for the requirements of this
subdivision (v), be obligated to be so qualified, to subject itself to
taxation in any such jurisdiction or to file a general consent to service of
process in any such jurisdiction;

 



 

(vi) use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be
listed on each securities exchange on which the same securities issued by the
Company are then listed;

 



      
 

 



 

(vii) use reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities covered
by such registration statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the Selling
Holder(s) thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

 



 

(viii) use reasonable best efforts to provide and cause to be maintained a
transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement from and after a date not later than the effective date
of such registration statement;

 



 

(ix) make, in accordance with customary practice and upon reasonable notice
during normal business hours, available for inspection by representatives of
the Selling Holders, any underwriters and any counsel or accountant retained
by the Selling Holders or underwriters all relevant financial and other
records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company and cause
appropriate officers, managers, employees, outside counsel and accountants of
the Company to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, underwriter, counsel or accountant in connection with their
due diligence exercise, including through in-person meetings, but subject to
the recipients of such information executing customary confidentiality
agreements and to customary privilege constraints and so long as such access
or request does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Company
and its subsidiaries.

 



 

(x) in connection with an Underwritten Offering, obtain for each Selling
Holder and underwriter:

 



 

(A) an opinion of counsel for the Company, covering the matters customarily
covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such other matters
as may be reasonably requested by such Selling Holder and underwriters,

 



 

(B) a "comfort" letter (or, in the case of any such Person which does not
satisfy the conditions for receipt of a "comfort" letter specified in
Statement on Auditing Standards No. 72, an "agreed upon procedures" letter)
signed by the independent public accountants who have certified the Companys
financial statements and, to the extent required, any other financial
statements included in such registration statement, covering the matters
customarily covered in "comfort" or "agreed upon procedures" letters in
connection with underwritten offerings; and

 



 

(C) to the extent requested and customary for the relevant transaction, enter
into a securities sales agreement with the Selling Holders providing for,
among other things, the appointment of a representative as agent for the
Selling Holders for the purpose of soliciting purchases of shares, which
agreement shall be customary in form, substance and scope and shall contain
customary representations, warranties and covenants;

 



 

(xi) as promptly as reasonably practicable notify, in writing, each Selling
Holder and the underwriters, if any, of the following events:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) the filing of the registration statement, the prospectus or any prospectus
supplement related thereto or post-effective amendment to the registration
statement or any Free Writing Prospectus utilized in connection therewith,
and, with respect to the registration statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto, when the same has become effective;

 



 

(B) any request by the Commission or any other U.S. or state-governmental
authority for amendments or supplements to the registration statement or the
prospectus or for additional information;

 



 

(C) the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the registration statement or the initiation of any
proceedings by any Person for that purpose; and

 



 

(D) the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
suspension of the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under
the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threat of any proceeding for such purpose;

 



 

(xii) notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus relating
thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, upon discovery
that, or upon the happening of any event as a result of which, the
registration statement, the prospectus included in such registration statement
or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to be stated in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, and, at
the request of any Selling Holder, as promptly as reasonably practicable
prepare and furnish to such Selling Holder a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that,
as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such
prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to be stated
in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading;

 



 

(xiii) make every reasonable effort to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement and to prevent or
obtain the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from
qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction as any Selling Holder and any underwriter of the securities being
sold by such Selling Holder shall reasonably request at the earliest date
reasonably practicable;

 



 

(xiv) otherwise use reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to Selling
Holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering the
period of at least 12 months, but not more than 18 months, beginning with the
first day of the Companys first full quarter after the effective date of such
registration statement, which earnings statement

 



      
 

 



 

shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 thereunder;

 



 

(xv) cooperate with each seller of Registrable Securities and each underwriter
or agent participating in the disposition of such Registrable Securities and
their respective counsel in connection with any filings required to be made
with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.;

 



 

(xvi) prior to the date on which the pricing of the relevant offering is
expected to occur, provide a CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities;

 



 

(xvii) use its reasonable best efforts to assist Stockholders who made a
request of the Company to provide for a third party "market maker" for the
Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to
serve as such "market maker"; and

 



 

(xviii) have appropriate officers of the Company prepare and make
presentations at any "road shows" and before analysts and rating agencies, as
the case may be, and otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate as
reasonably requested by the underwriters in the offering, marketing or selling
of the Registrable Securities.

 



 

(b) _Agreements._ Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Company agrees
to, in connection with registration of any Registrable Securities under this
Article II, enter into an underwriting agreement in form, scope and substance
as is customary in underwritten offerings including indemnification provisions
and procedures substantially to the effect set forth in Section 2.09 hereof
with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant thereto. In connection
with any offering of Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement, the Company shall (i) furnish to the underwriter, if any (or, if no
underwriter, the sellers of such Registrable Securities), unlegended (unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law) certificates representing ownership of
the Registrable Securities being sold under the registration statement, in
such denominations and registered in such names as requested by the lead or
co-managing underwriters or sellers, (ii) make available to the Companys
transfer agent prior to the effectiveness of such registration statement a
supply of such certificates and (iii) instruct any transfer agent and
registrar of the Registrable Securities to release any stop transfer order
with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _Return of Prospectuses._ Each Selling Holder agrees that upon receipt of
any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in clauses (B) through (D) of Section 2.06(a)(xi) or in Section
2.06(a)(xii), such Selling Holder shall forthwith discontinue such Selling
Holders disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the applicable
registration statement and prospectus relating thereto until such Selling
Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 2.06(a)(xi) or until it is advised in writing by the
Company that the use of the applicable prospectus may be resumed, and has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such prospectus and,
if so directed by the Company, deliver to the Company, at the Companys
expense, all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Selling
Holders possession of the prospectus current at the time of receipt of such
notice relating to such Registrable Securities. If the Company shall give such

 



      
 

 



 

notice, any applicable 120 day or two year period during which such
registration statement must remain effective pursuant to this Agreement shall
be extended by the number of days during the period from the date of giving of
a notice regarding the happening of an event of the kind described in Section
2.06(a)(xi) or Section 2.06(a)(xii) to the date when all such Selling Holders
shall receive such a supplemented or amended prospectus and such prospectus
shall have been filed with the Commission.

 



 

(d) _Requested Information._ Not less than five Business Days before the
expected filing date of each registration statement pursuant to this
Agreement, the Company shall notify each Selling Holder of the information,
documents and instruments from such Selling Holder that the Company or any
underwriter reasonably requests in connection with such registration
statement, including to a questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney,
lock-up letter and underwriting agreement (the " _Requested Information_ ").
If the Company has not received, on or before the second day before the
expected filing date, the Requested Information from such Selling Holder, the
Company may file the registration statement without including Registrable
Securities of such Selling Holder. The failure to so include in any
registration statement the Registrable Securities of a Selling Holder (with
regard to that registration statement) shall not in and of itself result in
any liability on the part of the Company to such Selling Holder. In the event
that, either immediately prior to or subsequent to the effectiveness of any
registration statement, any Stockholder shall distribute Registrable
Securities to its stockholders, partners or members, such Stockholder shall so
advise the Company and provide such information as shall be necessary or
advisable to permit an amendment to such registration statement or supplement
to any prospectus to provide information with respect to such stockholders,
partners or members, in their capacity as selling security holders (it being
understood that no such distribution of any Shares may be effectuated
following the pricing of an Underwritten Offering that includes such Shares).
As soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of such information, the
Company shall file an appropriate amendment to such registration statement or
supplement to any prospectus reflecting the information so provided.

 



 

(e) _No Requirement to Participate._ Neither the Company nor any Stockholder
shall be required to participate in any Public Offering.

 



 

(f) _Rule 144._ The Company covenants that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) file in a timely fashion the reports required to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted by the Commission thereunder (or, if it is not required to file such
reports, it will, upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities,
make publicly available other information so long as necessary to permit sales
in compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act), (ii) furnish to any
holder of Registrable Securities, as promptly as reasonably practicable upon
request, a written statement by the Company as to its compliance with the
reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and of the
Exchange Act, and (iii) take such further reasonable action, to the extent
required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation
of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule
may be amended from time to time, or any similar rule or regulation hereafter
adopted by the Commission.

 



       
 

 



 

SECTION 2.07 _Registration Expenses._ All expenses incident to the Companys
performance of, or compliance with, its obligations under this Agreement
including (a) all registration and filing fees, all fees and expenses of

certified public accountants and counsel (including, with respect to "comfort"

thereof, which counsels shall be selected by the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities being sold (collectively, the " _Registration Expenses_
") shall be borne by the Company. The Registration Expenses shall be borne by
the Company regardless of whether or not any registration statement is filed
or becomes effective. the Company will pay its internal expenses (including
all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties, the expense of any annual audit and the expense of any
liability insurance), the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be
registered on each securities exchange and included in each established over-
the-counter market on which similar securities issued by the Company are then
listed or traded and any expenses of the Company incurred in connection with
any "road show". Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata portion (based on
the number of Registrable Securities registered) of all underwriting discounts
and commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale of such
Selling Holders Registrable Securities pursuant to any registration.

 



 

SECTION 2.08 _Miscellaneous_. The Company may grant demand, piggyback or shelf
registration rights to third parties, provided that the terms of such rights
are not senior to and do not conflict with the rights granted to the holders
of Registrable Securities hereunder without the prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the OEP
Stockholders.

 



 

SECTION 2.09 _Indemnification._ (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Selling Holder and their respective Affiliates, member,
partners, directors, officers and employees and each Person, if any, who
controls any Selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of their respective
representatives as follows:

 



 

(i) against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and
reasonable expenses whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) pursuant to which
Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act, including all
documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or arising out of any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) including all
documents incorporated therein by

 



      
 

 



 

reference, or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

 



 

(ii) against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and
reasonable expenses whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate
amount paid in settlement of any litigation, investigation or proceeding by
any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any other
claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with the
written consent of the Company; and

 



 

(iii) against any and all reasonable expense whatsoever, as incurred
(including, subject to Section 2.09(c), fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred in investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation,
investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or
threatened, in each case whether or not such Person is a party, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is
not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that this indemnity agreement does not apply to any
Selling Holder with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage, judgment or
expense to the extent arising out of any untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission (A) made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Selling
Holder expressly for use in a Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or any related prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
(B) if such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission was corrected in an amended or supplemented Registration Statement or
prospectus and the Company had furnished copies thereof to the Person
asserting such loss, liability, claim, damage, judgment or expense purchased
the securities that are the subject thereof prior to the date of sale by such
Selling Holder to such Person.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by Selling Holders._ Each Selling Holder shall severally
(but not jointly) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each other
Selling Holder, and each of their respective Affiliates, members, partners,
directors, officers and employees (including each officer of the Company who
signed the Registration Statement) and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company, or any other Selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of their respective
representatives, against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages,
judgments and expenses described in the indemnity contained in Section 2.09(a)
(provided that any settlement of the type described therein is effected with
the written consent of such Selling Holder) as incurred, but only with respect
to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions,
made in a Registration Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by such Selling Holder expressly for use in such Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto); _provided_ , _however_ , that an indemnifying Selling
Holder shall not be required to provide indemnification in any amount in
excess of the amount by which (x) the total price at which the Registrable
Securities sold by such indemnifying Selling Holder and its Affiliates and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds (y) the amount

 



      
 

 



 

of any damages which such indemnifying Selling Holder has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. The Company shall be entitled, to the extent
customary, to receive indemnification and contribution from underwriters,
selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals
participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided above with
respect to information so furnished in writing by such Persons specifically
for inclusion in any prospectus or Registration Statement.

 



 

(c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings._ Each indemnified party or
parties shall give reasonably prompt notice to each indemnifying party or
parties of any action or proceeding commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying
party or parties shall not relieve it or them from any liability which it or
they may have under this indemnity agreement, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. If
the indemnifying party or parties so elects within a reasonable time after
receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party or parties may assume the
defense of such action or proceeding at such indemnifying partys or parties
expense with counsel chosen by the indemnifying party or parties and approved
by the indemnified party defendant in such action or proceeding, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
such indemnified party or parties reasonably determine that a conflict of
interest exists and that therefore it is advisable for such indemnified party
or parties to be represented by separate counsel or that, upon advice of
counsel, there may be legal defenses available to it or them which are
different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party,
then the indemnifying party or parties shall not be entitled to assume such
defense and the indemnified party or parties shall be entitled to separate
counsel (limited in each jurisdiction to one counsel for all indemnified
parties under this Agreement) at the indemnifying partys or parties expense.
If any indemnifying party or parties are not so entitled to assume the defense
of such action or do not assume such defense, after having received the notice
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, the indemnifying party or
parties will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
indemnified party or parties (limited in each jurisdiction to one counsel for
all indemnified parties under this Agreement). In such event, however, no
indemnifying party or parties will be liable for any settlement effected
without the written consent of such indemnifying party or parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_
, that if at any time an indemnified party or parties shall have requested an
indemnifying party or parties to reimburse the indemnified party or parties
for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the
indemnifying party or parties shall be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without the written consent of such indemnifying party or
parties if (x) such settlement is entered into more than 15 business days
after receipt by such indemnifying party or parties of the aforesaid request
accompanied by supporting documents reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnifying party or parties and (y) such indemnifying party or parties shall
not have reimbursed the indemnified party or parties in accordance with such
request prior to the date of such settlement. If an indemnifying party is
entitled to assume, and assumes, the defense of such action or proceeding in
accordance with this paragraph, such indemnifying party or parties shall not,
except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.09(c), be liable for any fees
and expenses of counsel for the indemnified parties incurred thereafter in
connection with such action or proceeding.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Contribution._ (i)In order to provide for just and equitable contribution
in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Section
2.09 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties
although applicable in accordance with its terms in respect of any losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses suffered by an
indemnified party referred to therein, each applicable indemnifying party, in
lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, judgments and expenses in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and
of the liable Selling Holders (including, in each case, that of their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents), on the other, in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, judgments or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company, on the
one hand, and of the liable Selling Holders (including, in each case, that of
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents), on the other,
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Company, on the one hand, or by or on behalf of the Selling Holders, on the
other, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the losses, liabilities, claims, damages,
judgments and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 2.09(c), any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or
defending any action or claim.

 



 

(ii) The Company and each Selling Holder agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 2.09(d) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in sub-paragraph (i)
above. Notwithstanding this Section 2.09(d), in the case of distributions to
the public, an indemnifying Selling Holder shall not be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which (A) the total price at which the
Registrable Securities sold by such indemnifying Selling Holder and its
Affiliates and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds
(B) the amount of any damages which such indemnifying Selling Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of this Section, each Person, if any, who controls a
Selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall
have the same rights to contribution as such Selling Holder; and each director
of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration
Statement, and each Person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, shall have the same rights to
contribution as the Company.

SECTION 3.03 _Severability_. If any provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that provision (or part
thereof) will, to the extent possible, be modified in such a manner as to be
valid, legal and enforceable but so as to retain most nearly the intent of the
parties as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not possible, that
provision (or part thereof) will be severed from this Agreement, and in either
case the validity, legality and

 



      
 

 



 

enforceability of the remaining provisions (or parts thereof) of this
Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If any
provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision (or part thereof) shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

SECTION 3.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, and any documents delivered
by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings among the parties with respect thereto. No
addition to or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall be
binding upon any party hereto unless made in writing and signed by all parties
hereto.

pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy
accruing to any party as a result of any breach or default hereunder by any
other party shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision
hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 3.07 _Assignment_. No Stockholder shall assign any of its rights under
this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Person, without first obtaining
the prior written consent of the Company; provided, that, without the consent
of the Company, a Stockholder may assign its rights under this Agreement with
respect to any Registrable Securities to any Permitted Transferee of such
Registrable Securities who executes a Joinder Agreement prior to or
concurrently with the Transfer of such Registrable Securities to such
Permitted Transferee, and any assignment in contravention hereof shall be null
and void. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns.

 



 

SECTION 3.08 _Benefit_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer on any person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 3.09 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement and the
rights and obligations of the parties hereto shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law

 



      
 

 



 

provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that any
legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns,
shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware)
(collectively with Delaware Court of Chancery, the " _Delaware Courts_ ").
Each of the parties hereto further agrees not to commence any litigation
relating to this Agreement except in the Delaware Courts, waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and
agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation
brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH
ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DEFENSE OR OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO
THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE
DELAWARE COURTS AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY PROCEEDING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT
IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 



 

SECTION 3.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one
and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies
hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the parties
hereto.

 



 

SECTION 3.11 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or if this
Agreement was otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy hereunder. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any Delaware Court without proof of actual damages and each party hereto
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a
remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Applicable Law or in equity for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach.

set forth below (together with any PIK Notes issued pursuant to Section 1.1
below, the " _Note_ "). The principal and interest on this Note is payable in
lawful money of the United States of America in immediately available funds at
such place in the United States as Payee may from time to time designate in
writing to Payor.

_Merger Agreement_ "), dated May 23, 2017 by and among Sonus Networks Inc.,
Genband Holdings Company, Genband Inc., Genband II, Inc., the Payor and the
other parties thereto, and is the " _Promissory Note_ " referred to therein.
Payee is receiving this Note pursuant to the Merger Agreement. All capitalized
terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to
such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

1. _Payment of Principal and Interest_

 



 

1.1 _Calculation and Payment of Interest_.

 



 

Interest on the principal balance of this Note outstanding from time to time
until paid in full in cash shall accrue at the rate equal to the Applicable
Rate _per annum_ , computed on the basis of a 360-day year, for the actual
number of days elapsed, commencing on the date hereof. " _Applicable Rate_ "
means, 7.5% on or before the date that is exactly six months after the Issue
Date, and after the date that is exactly six months after the Issue Date means
10.0%. Interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears, beginning on the last
day of the first calendar quarter following the Issue Date and on the last
date of each calendar quarter thereafter (each, an " _Interest Payment Date_
") until the Maturity Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amount of cash
interest which is not paid on an Interest Payment Date as a result of a
Payment Restriction or pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall be made either (i)
by the issuance of a promissory note in a principal amount equal to interest
accrued but not otherwise paid (by the issuance of a PIK Note or otherwise) on
the principal amount hereof through and including such Interest Payment Date
and otherwise having such terms and provisions that are the same as the terms
and provisions of this Note (each such promissory note a " _PIK Note_ ") and
Payor shall be deemed to have issued a PIK Note for any such interest
regardless of whether Payor shall have actually delivered any such PIK Note or
(ii) by increasing the principal amount of this Note by the amount of such
cash interest. Payee, by its acceptance hereof, acknowledges (i) that Payor is
contractually bound hereunder to pay cash interest only to the extent not
prohibited by a Payment Restriction or by Section 3 hereof, (ii) that any cash
interest not so paid shall be paid in the form of a PIK Note or by increasing
the principal amount of this Note by the amount of such cash interest, and
(iii) the failure to pay cash interest as a result of a Payment Restriction or
pursuant to Section 3 hereof shall not constitute a default or Event of
Default under this Note.

 



 

1.2 _Payment on Maturity Date_. The principal balance of, and any accrued and
unpaid interest on, this Note (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
principal balance of and any accrued and unpaid interest on any PIK Note)
shall be payable in cash on the third anniversary of the Issue Date the ("
_Maturity Date_ ").

 



 

1.3 _Prepayment_.

 



 

(a) Payor may, at its option at any time, without premium or penalty, prepay
all or any portion of this Note.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Any prepayment of this Note shall be applied as follows: _first_ , to
payment of accrued interest; and _second_ , to payment of principal. Upon any
partial prepayment, at the request either of Majority Payees or Payor, this
Note shall be surrendered to Payor in exchange for a substitute note, which
shall set forth the revised principal amount but otherwise be identical to
this Note. In the event that this Note is prepaid in its entirety, this Note
shall be surrendered to Payor for cancellation as a condition to any such
prepayment.

 



 

1.4 _Payment Only on Business Days; Payments Free and Clear_. Any payment
hereunder which, but for this Section 1.4, would be payable on a day which is
not a Business Day, shall instead be due and payable on the Business Day next
following such date for payment. All payments hereunder shall be made free and
clear of any deduction, withholding or offset and in immediately available
funds, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.

 



 

2. _Events of Default_

3. _Subordination_

 



 

3.1 _Note Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness_. To the extent and in the
manner hereinafter set forth in this Section 3, the indebtedness represented
by this Note and the payment of the principal of and the interest on this Note
and any claim for rescission of the purchase of this Note, and any claim which

contribution on account of such a claim, and all other payments with respect
to or on account of this Note (collectively, the " _Subordinated Debt_ ") are
hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior
payment in full in cash of all Senior Indebtedness then outstanding. This
Section 3 constitutes a continuing offer to all Persons who become holders of,
or continue to hold, Senior Indebtedness, each of whom is an obligee hereunder
and is entitled to enforce such holders rights hereunder, subject to the
provisions hereof, without any act or notice of acceptance hereof or reliance
hereon. For purposes of this Section 3, Senior Indebtedness shall not be
deemed to have been paid and shall be deemed to be outstanding in full until
the termination of all commitments or other obligations by any holder thereof
and unless all such holders shall have received payment in full in cash of all
obligations under or in respect of Senior Indebtedness (including, without
limitation, post-petition interest, if any).

 



 

3.2 _No Payment on Note in Certain Circumstances_.

 



 

(a) To the extent any payment hereunder is blocked by a Payment Restriction
(or there occurs and is continuing a payment default or payment event of
default under any Senior Indebtedness), no direct or indirect payment of any
kind shall be made, asked for,

 



      
 

 



 

demanded, accepted, received or retained with respect to principal, interest
or other amounts due under the Note nor shall any holder thereof exercise any
remedies with respect thereto.

 



 

(b) Payee agrees that, so long as payments or distributions for or on account
of the Subordinated Debt are not permitted pursuant to this Section 3, Payee
will not take, sue for, ask or demand from Payor payment of all or any amounts
under or in respect of this Note, or commence, or join with any creditor other
than the holders of Senior Indebtedness and their agents in commencing,
directly or indirectly cause Payor to commence, or assist Payor in commencing,
any proceeding referred to in Section 3.3, and Payee shall not take or receive
from Payor, directly or indirectly or on its behalf, in cash or other property
or by set-off or in any other manner, including, without limitation, from or
by way of collateral, payment of all or any amounts under or in respect of the
Subordinated Debt. In the event that notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 3.2, any payment or distribution of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities, shall be received by Payee by or on
account of or in respect of the Subordinated Debt while a Payment Restriction
exists or while payments or distributions for or on account of the
Subordinated Debt are otherwise not permitted pursuant to this Section 3, such
payment or distribution shall be received and held in trust for, and shall be
paid over (in the same form as so received, to the extent practicable, and
with any necessary endorsement) to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness
remaining unpaid or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee
or trustees under any such indenture or agreement under which any Senior
Indebtedness may have been issued, for application (in the case of cash) to,
or as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or securities) for the
payment or prepayment of Senior Indebtedness, until all Senior Indebtedness
shall have been paid in full in cash, after giving effect to any concurrent
payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

 



 

3.3 _Dissolution; Liquidation; Bankruptcy; Acceleration_. In the event of (i)
any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, or any receivership,
liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding in connection
therewith, relative to the Payor or any of its assets, or (ii) any
liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Payor, whether voluntary
or involuntary or whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, or (iii)
any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of assets
or liabilities of the Payor, or (iv) the acceleration of

 



      
 

 



 

the Senior Indebtedness by reason of the occurrence of a default or an event
of default thereunder:

 



 

(a) The holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall first be entitled to receive
payment in full in cash of all Senior Indebtedness before any direct or
indirect payment may be made for or on account of payments under or in respect
of the Subordinated Debt, whether in cash, property or securities of any kind;

 



 

(b) Any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities (including any payment or distribution that may be
payable by reason of any other indebtedness of Payor being subordinated to
payment of the Subordinated Debt), to which Payee would be entitled except for
the provisions of this Section 3, shall be paid by the liquidating trustee or
agent or other person making such payment or distribution, whether a trustee
in bankruptcy, a receiver or liquidating trustee or other trustee or agent,
directly to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their representative or
representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture or other
agreement under which any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued for
application (in the case of cash) to, or as collateral (in the case of non-
cash property or securities) for the payment or prepayment of Senior
Indebtedness, to the extent necessary to make payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness remaining unpaid, after giving effect to any concurrent payment
or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness;

 



 

(c) The holders of Senior Indebtedness are hereby irrevocably authorized and
empowered (in their own names or in the name of Payee or otherwise), but shall
have no obligation, to demand, sue for, collect and receive every payment or
distribution referred to in paragraph (b) above to file (but not vote) claims
and proofs of claim as they may deem necessary or advisable for the exercise
or enforcement of any of the rights or interests of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness hereunder.

 



 

(d) Payee shall duly and promptly take such action as the holders of Senior
Indebtedness may reasonably request to execute and deliver to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness such powers of attorney, assignments, or other instruments
as the holders of Senior Indebtedness may request in order to enable the
holders of Senior Indebtedness to enforce any

 



      
 

 



 

and all claims with respect to, and any security interests and other liens
securing payment of, the amounts owing under the Subordinated Debt.

 



 

(e) In the event that, any payment or distribution of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities (including any payment or distribution
that may be payable by reason of any other indebtedness of Payor being
subordinated to payment of the Subordinated Debt), shall be received by Payee
for or on account of or in respect of the Subordinated Debt in contravention
of this Section 3.3 before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash,
such payment or distribution shall be received and held in trust for, and
shall be paid over (in the same form as so received, to the extent
practicable, and with any necessary endorsement) to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness remaining unpaid or their representative or representatives, or
to the trustee or trustees under any such indenture or agreement under which
any Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, for application (in the case of
cash) to, or as collateral (in the case of non-cash property or securities)
for the payment or prepayment of Senior Indebtedness, until all Senior
Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

 



 

3.4 _Subrogation_. Upon the final payment in full in cash of all Senior
Indebtedness, Payee shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior
Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or
securities of Payor applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal
of and interest on and all other amounts payable under the Subordinated Debt
shall be paid in full in cash, and for the purposes of such subrogation, no
payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Indebtedness of any
cash, property or securities to which Payee would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Section 3 and no payment pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3 to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Payee shall, as between
Payor, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness, and Payee, be
deemed to be a payment by Payor to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness.
It is understood that the provisions of this Section 3 are and are intended
solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of Payee, on the one
hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

principal of and interest on and all other amounts due under this Note in
accordance with its terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of Payee and creditors of Payor (other than the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness), nor shall anything herein prevent Payee from exercising all

competent jurisdiction in which bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or a certificate of the
receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other person
making such payment or distribution, delivered to Payee, for the purpose of
ascertaining the persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the
holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of Payor, the amount
thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon
and all other facts pertinent thereto or to Section 3 of this Note.

 



 

3.7 _Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or Omissions of Payor or
Holders of Senior Indebtedness_. No right of any present or future holders of
any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as provided herein will at
any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on
the part of Payor or by any act or failure to act by any such holder, or by
any act, failure to act or noncompliance by Payor, the holders of Senior
Indebtedness or their respective agents with the terms of this Note,

holders of Senior Indebtedness hereunder, and all agreements and obligations

thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against Payor or any other
person or entity or any collateral.

ARTICLE III 
PURPOSE

 



 

The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted by the
Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations
may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ ").

 



 

ARTICLE IV 
CAPITAL STOCK

 



 

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 1,100 shares, consisting solely of:

 



 

1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common Stock_
"); and

 



 

100 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred
Stock_ ").

 



 

The following is a statement of the powers, designations, preferences,
privileges, and relative rights in respect of each class of capital stock of
the Corporation.

 



 

A. COMMON STOCK.

 



 

1. _General_. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

 



 

2. _Voting_. The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held at all meetings of stockholders. There shall be no cumulative voting.

 



 

3. _Dividends_. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock from funds lawfully available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors and subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

 



      
 

 



 

4. _Liquidation_. Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive all assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

 



 

B. PREFERRED STOCK.

 



 

1. _General_.

 



 

Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series, each of such series to have such powers, designations, preferences,
and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights, if any, and
such qualifications and restrictions, if any, of such preferences and rights,
as are stated or expressed in the resolution or resolutions of the Board of
Directors providing for such series of Preferred Stock. Different series of
Preferred Stock shall not be construed to constitute different classes of
shares for the purposes of voting by classes unless expressly so provided in
such resolution or resolutions.

 



 

Authority is hereby granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to
issue the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the
creation of any such series, by resolution or resolutions to determine and fix
the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional,
or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications and restrictions, if
any, of such preferences and rights, including without limitation dividend
rights, conversion rights, voting rights (if any), redemption privileges, and
liquidation preferences, of such series of Preferred Stock (which need not be
uniform among series), all to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or
resolutions providing for the creation or issuance of any series of Preferred
Stock may provide that such series shall be superior to, rank equally with, or
be junior to the Preferred Stock of any other series, all to the fullest
extent permitted by law. No resolution, vote, or consent of the holders of the
capital stock of the Corporation shall be required in connection with the
creation or issuance of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock authorized
by and complying with the conditions of this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the right to any such resolution, vote, or consent being
expressly waived by all present and future holders of the capital stock of the
Corporation.

 



 

Any resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to
the authority vested in them by this Article IV shall be set forth in a
certificate of designation along with the number of shares of stock of such
series as to which the resolution or resolutions shall apply and such
certificate shall be executed, acknowledged, filed, recorded, and shall become
effective, in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL. Unless otherwise
provided in any such resolution or resolutions, the number of shares of stock
of any such series to which such resolution or resolutions apply may be
increased (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class)
or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by
a certificate likewise executed, acknowledged, filed and recorded, setting
forth a statement that a specified increase or decrease therein has been
authorized and directed by a resolution or resolutions likewise adopted by the
Board of Directors. In case the number of such shares shall be decreased, the
number of shares so specified in the certificate shall resume the status which
they had prior to the adoption of the first resolution or resolutions. When no
shares of any such class

 



      
 

 



 

or series are outstanding, either because none were issued or because none
remain outstanding, a certificate setting forth a resolution or resolutions
adopted by the Board of Directors that none of the authorized shares of such
class or series are outstanding, and that none will be issued subject to the
certificate of designations previously filed with respect to such class or
series, may be executed, acknowledged, filed and recorded in the same manner
as previously described and it shall have the effect of eliminating from this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the certificate
of designations with respect to such class or series of stock. If no shares of
any such class or series established by a resolution or resolutions adopted by
the Board of Directors have been issued, the voting powers, designations,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, if any,
with the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, may be amended
by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. In the event
of any such amendment, a certificate which (i) states that no shares of such
class or series have been issued, (ii) sets forth the copy of the amending
resolution or resolutions and (iii) if the designation of such class or series
is being changed, indicates the original designation and the new designation,
shall be executed, acknowledged, filed, recorded, and shall become effective,
in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL.

 



 

ARTICLE V 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 



 

The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and
for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for defining and
regulating the powers of the Corporation and its directors and stockholders
and are in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon the
Corporation by statute:

 



 

(a) Each director shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
stockholders and until his or her respective successor shall have been duly
elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Except as may otherwise
be provided by the DGCL or the By-Laws of the Corporation, any director or the
entire Board of Directors may be removed from office at any time, with or
without cause but only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of the shares of the Corporations stock entitled to
vote for the election of directors. The number of directors constituting the
full Board of Directors shall be such number as the Board of Directors from
time to time may determine.

 



 

(b) The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority: (i) to adopt,
amend or repeal By-Laws of the Corporation, subject only to such limitations,
if any, as may be from time to time imposed by other provisions of this
Certificate, by law, or by the By-Laws; and (ii) to the full extent permitted
or not prohibited by law, and without the consent of or other action by the
stockholders, to authorize or create mortgage, pledges or other liens or
encumbrances upon any or all of the assets, real, personal or mixed, and
franchises of the Corporation, including after-acquired property, and to
exercise all of the powers of the Corporation in connection therewith.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VI 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 



 

No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation
or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such
liability; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent required from time to time by
applicable law, this Article VI shall not eliminate or limit the liability of
a director, to the extent such liability is provided by applicable law, (i)
for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174
of Title 8 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transactions from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this
Article VI shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged
liability of any director for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such
director occurring prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal.

 



 

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the
DGCL, as amended from time to time, indemnify each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was, or has agreed to
become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has
agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer or
trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee benefit
plan), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in
such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys fees), judgements,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him
or on his behalf in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any
appeal therefrom.

 



 

Indemnification may include payment by the Corporation of expenses in
defending an action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such
action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by the person indemnified
to repay such payment if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification under this Article VII, which undertaking may be
accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make
such repayment.

 



 

The Corporation shall not indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless
the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors.

 



 

The indemnification rights provided in this Article VII (i) shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be
entitled under any law, agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, and (ii) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
executors and administrators of such persons. The Corporation may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant
indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or
other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VII.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VIII 
COMPROMISES AND ARRANGEMENTS

 



 

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and
its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within
the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the
Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of
any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution
or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section
279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class
of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said
court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths (3/4ths) in
value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or
class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any
compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as
consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or
arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to
which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders,
of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE IX 
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

 



 

The Board of Directors, when considering a tender offer or merger or
acquisition proposal, may take into account factors in addition to potential
economic benefits to stockholders, including without limitation (i) comparison
of the proposed consideration to be received by stockholders in relation to
the then current market price of the Corporations capital stock, the
estimated current value of the Corporation in a freely negotiated transaction,
and the estimated future value of the Corporation as an independent entity,
(ii) the impact of such a transaction on the employees, suppliers, and
customers of the Corporation and its effect on the communities in which the
Corporation operates, and (iii) the impact of such a transaction on the unique
corporate culture and atmosphere of the Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE X 
STOCKHOLDER ACTION

 



 

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation may be taken either at a duly called annual or special meeting of
the stockholders or by written consent in lieu of such a meeting, and special
meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, the President, or a majority of the Board of Directors.

 



 

ARTICLE XI 
SEVERABILITY

 



 

To the extent that any provision of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation
is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and following

 



      
 

 



 

any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision of
this Restated Certificate of incorporation is invalid or unenforceable, this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall contain only such provisions (i)
as were in effect immediately prior to such determination and (ii) were not so
determined to be invalid or unenforceable.

 



 

ARTICLE XII 
AMENDMENTS

 



 

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of
the outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon (in addition
to any separate class vote required by law or that may in the future be
required pursuant to the terms of any outstanding Preferred Stock), voting
together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal the
provisions of Articles IV (to the extent it relates to the authority of the
Board of Directors to issue shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series,
the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors), V, VII, IX,
X, or XII of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or to reduce the
numbers of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock.

Shares held jointly by more than one person and delivery of a certificate to
one joint holder shall be a sufficient delivery to all of them.

renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence and indemnity and on the payment
of such expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in investigating evidence,
as the Directors may prescribe, and (in the case of defacement or wearing out)
upon delivery of the old certificate.

 



 

6.4 Every share certificate sent in accordance with the Articles will be sent
at the risk of the Member or other person entitled to the certificate. The
Company will not be responsible for any share certificate lost or delayed in
the course of delivery.

 



 

 **7** **Transfer of Shares**

 



 

7.1 Shares are transferable subject to the approval of the Directors by
resolution who may, in their absolute discretion, decline to register any
transfer of Shares without giving any reason. If the Directors refuse to
register a transfer they shall notify the transferee within two months of such
refusal.

 



      
 

 



 

7.2 The instrument of transfer of any Share shall be in writing and shall be
executed by or on behalf of the transferor (and if the Directors so require,

Shares (including any redeemable Shares) in such manner and on such other

Share, determine that such Share shall be held as a Treasury Share.

 



 

9.2 The Directors may determine to cancel a Treasury Share or transfer a
Treasury Share on such terms as they think proper (including, without
limitation, for nil consideration).

 



 

 **10** **Variation of Rights of Shares**

 



 

10.1 If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into different
classes of Shares, all or any of the rights attached to any class (unless
otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class) may,
whether or not the Company is being wound up, be varied without the consent of
the holders of the issued Shares of that class where such variation is
considered by the Directors not to have a material adverse effect upon such
rights; otherwise, any such variation shall be made only with the consent in
writing of the holders of not less than two thirds of the issued Shares of
that class, or with the approval of a resolution passed by a majority of not
less than two thirds of the votes cast at a separate meeting of the holders of
the Shares of that class. For the avoidance of doubt, the Directors reserve
the right, notwithstanding that any such variation may not have a material
adverse effect, to obtain consent from the holders of Shares of the relevant
class. To any such meeting all the provisions of the Articles relating to
general meetings shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ , except that the necessary
quorum shall be one person holding or representing by proxy at least one third
of the issued Shares of the class and that any holder of Shares of the class
present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.

 



 

10.2 For the purposes of a separate class meeting, the Directors may treat two
or more or all the classes of Shares as forming one class of Shares if the
Directors consider that such class of Shares would be affected in the same way
by the proposals under consideration, but in any other case shall treat them
as separate classes of Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

10.3 The rights conferred upon the holders of the Shares of any class issued
with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided
by the terms of issue of the Shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by
the creation or issue of further Shares ranking pari passu therewith.

 



 

 **11** **Commission on Sale of Shares**

 



 

The Company may, in so far as the Statute permits, pay a commission to any
person in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe (whether
absolutely or conditionally) or procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions
(whether absolutely or conditionally) for any Shares. Such commissions may be
satisfied by the payment of cash and/or the issue of fully or partly paid-up
Shares. The Company may also on any issue of Shares pay such brokerage as may
be lawful.

 



 

 **12** **Non Recognition of Trusts**

 



 

The Company shall not be bound by or compelled to recognise in any way (even
when notified) any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any
Share, or (except only as is otherwise provided by the Articles or the
Statute) any other rights in respect of any Share other than an absolute right
to the entirety thereof in the holder.

 



 

 **13** **Lien on Shares**

 



 

13.1 The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on all Shares (whether
fully paid-up or not) registered in the name of a Member (whether solely or
jointly with others) for all debts, liabilities or engagements to or with the
Company (whether presently payable or not) by such Member or his estate,
either alone or jointly with any other person, whether a Member or not, but
the Directors may at any time declare any Share to be wholly or in part exempt
from the provisions of this Article. The registration of a transfer of any
such Share shall operate as a waiver of the Companys lien thereon. The
Companys lien on a Share shall also extend to any amount payable in respect
of that Share.

 



 

13.2 The Company may sell, in such manner as the Directors think fit, any
Shares on which the Company has a lien, if a sum in respect of which the lien
exists is presently payable, and is not paid within fourteen clear days after
notice has been received or deemed to have been received by the holder of the
Shares, or to the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy of the holder, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is
not complied with the Shares may be sold.

 



 

13.3 To give effect to any such sale the Directors may authorise any person to
execute an instrument of transfer of the Shares sold to, or in accordance with
the directions of, the purchaser. The purchaser or his nominee shall be
registered as the holder of the Shares comprised in any such transfer, and he
shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, nor shall
his title to the Shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the
sale or the exercise of the Companys power of sale under the Articles.

 



 

13.4 The net proceeds of such sale after payment of costs, shall be applied in
payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is
presently payable and any balance shall (subject to a like lien for sums not
presently payable as existed upon the Shares before the sale) be paid to the
person entitled to the Shares at the date of the sale.

 



      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **14** **Call on Shares**

 



 

14.1 Subject to the terms of the allotment and issue of any Shares, the
Directors may make calls upon the Members in respect of any monies unpaid on
their Shares (whether in respect of par value or premium), and each Member
shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen clear days notice specifying
the time or times of payment) pay to the Company at the time or times so
specified the amount called on the Shares. A call may be revoked or postponed,
in whole or in part, as the Directors may determine. A call may be required to
be paid by instalments. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable
for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the Shares
in respect of which the call was made.

 



 

14.2 A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution
of the Directors authorising such call was passed.

 



 

14.3 The joint holders of a Share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay
all calls in respect thereof.

 



 

14.4 If a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable, the person
from whom it is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day it
became due and payable until it is paid at such rate as the Directors may
determine (and in addition all expenses that have been incurred by the Company
by reason of such non-payment), but the Directors may waive payment of the
interest or expenses wholly or in part.

 



 

14.5 An amount payable in respect of a Share on issue or allotment or at any
fixed date, whether on account of the par value of the Share or premium or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid all the
provisions of the Articles shall apply as if that amount had become due and
payable by virtue of a call.

 



 

14.6 The Directors may issue Shares with different terms as to the amount and
times of payment of calls, or the interest to be paid.

 



 

14.7 The Directors may, if they think fit, receive an amount from any Member
willing to advance all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any
Shares held by him, and may (until the amount would otherwise become payable)
pay interest at such rate as may be agreed upon between the Directors and the
Member paying such amount in advance.

 



 

14.8 No such amount paid in advance of calls shall entitle the Member paying
such amount to any portion of a Dividend or other distribution payable in
respect of any period prior to the date upon which such amount would, but for
such payment, become payable.

 



 

 **15** **Forfeiture of Shares**

 



 

15.1 If a call or instalment of a call remains unpaid after it has become due
and payable the Directors may give to the person from whom it is due not less
than fourteen clear days notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid
together with any interest which may have accrued and any expenses incurred by
the Company by reason of such non-payment. The notice shall specify where
payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with
the Shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be
forfeited.

 



 

15.2 If the notice is not complied with, any Share in respect of which it was
given may, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be
forfeited by a resolution of the Directors.

 



      
 

 



 

Such forfeiture shall include all Dividends, other distributions or other
monies payable in respect of the forfeited Share and not paid before the
forfeiture.

 



 

15.3 A forfeited Share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on
such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit and at any time
before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the forfeiture may be cancelled on
such terms as the Directors think fit. Where for the purposes of its disposal
a forfeited Share is to be transferred to any person the Directors may
authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of the Share in
favour of that person.

 



 

15.4 A person any of whose Shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a
Member in respect of them and shall surrender to the Company for cancellation
the certificate for the Shares forfeited and shall remain liable to pay to the
Company all monies which at the date of forfeiture were payable by him to the
Company in respect of those Shares together with interest at such rate as the
Directors may determine, but his liability shall cease if and when the Company
shall have received payment in full of all monies due and payable by him in
respect of those Shares.

 



 

15.5 A certificate in writing under the hand of one Director or officer of the
Company that a Share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be
conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming
to be entitled to the Share. The certificate shall (subject to the execution
of an instrument of transfer) constitute a good title to the Share and the
person to whom the Share is sold or otherwise disposed of shall not be bound
to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title
to the Share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings
in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the Share.

 



 

15.6 The provisions of the Articles as to forfeiture shall apply in the case
of non payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a Share, becomes
payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the par value of the Share or
by way of premium as if it had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and
notified.

 



 

 **16** **Transmission of Shares**

 



 

16.1 If a Member dies the survivor or survivors (where he was a joint holder)
or his legal personal representatives (where he was a sole holder), shall be
the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his Shares.
The estate of a deceased Member is not thereby released from any liability in
respect of any Share, for which he was a joint or sole holder.

 



 

16.2 Any person becoming entitled to a Share in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other way than
by transfer) may, upon such evidence being produced as may be required by the
Directors, elect, by a notice in writing sent by him to the Company, either to
become the holder of such Share or to have some person nominated by him
registered as the holder of such Share. If he elects to have another person
registered as the holder of such Share he shall sign an instrument of transfer
of that Share to that person. The Directors shall, in either case, have the
same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the
case of a transfer of the Share by the relevant Member before his death or
bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution, as the case may be.

 



 

16.3 A person becoming entitled to a Share by reason of the death or
bankruptcy or liquidation or dissolution of a Member (or in any other case
than by transfer) shall be entitled to the same Dividends, other distributions
and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of
such Share. However, he shall not, before becoming a Member in respect of a
Share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by
membership in relation to general

 



      
 

 



 

meetings of the Company and the Directors may at any time give notice
requiring any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to have
some person nominated by him be registered as the holder of the Share (but the
Directors shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend
registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the Share by
the relevant Member before his death or bankruptcy or liquidation or
dissolution or any other case than by transfer, as the case may be). If the
notice is not complied with within ninety days of being received or deemed to
be received (as determined pursuant to the Articles) the Directors may
thereafter withhold payment of all Dividends, other distributions, bonuses or
other monies payable in respect of the Share until the requirements of the
notice have been complied with.

 



 

 **17** **Amendments of Memorandum and Articles of Association and Alteration
of Capital**

 



 

17.1 The Company may by Ordinary Resolution:

 



 

(a) increase its share capital by such sum as the Ordinary Resolution shall
prescribe and with such rights, priorities and privileges annexed thereto, as
the Company in general meeting may determine;

 



 

(b) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into Shares of
larger amount than its existing Shares;

 



 

(c) convert all or any of its paid-up Shares into stock, and reconvert that
stock into paid-up Shares of any denomination;

 



 

(d) by subdivision of its existing Shares or any of them divide the whole or
any part of its share capital into Shares of smaller amount than is fixed by
the Memorandum or into Shares without par value; and

 



 

(e) cancel any Shares that at the date of the passing of the Ordinary
Resolution have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and
diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the Shares so
cancelled.

 



 

17.2 All new Shares created in accordance with the provisions of the preceding
Article shall be subject to the same provisions of the Articles with reference
to the payment of calls, liens, transfer, transmission, forfeiture and
otherwise as the Shares in the original share capital.

 



 

17.3 Subject to the provisions of the Statute and the provisions of the
Articles as regards the matters to be dealt with by Ordinary Resolution, the
Company may by Special Resolution:

 



 

(a) change its name;

 



 

(b) alter or add to the Articles;

 



 

(c) alter or add to the Memorandum with respect to any objects, powers or
other matters specified therein; and

 



 

(d) reduce its share capital or any capital redemption reserve fund.

 



       
 

 

 ** **

 

 **18** **Offices and Places of Business**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Company may by resolution of the
Directors change the location of its Registered Office. The Company may, in
addition to its Registered Office, maintain such other offices or places of
business as the Directors determine.

 



 

 **19** **General Meetings**

 



 

19.1 All general meetings other than annual general meetings shall be called
extraordinary general meetings.

 



 

19.2 The Company may, but shall not (unless required by the Statute) be
obliged to, in each year hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting,
and shall specify the meeting as such in the notices calling it. Any annual
general meeting shall be held at such time and place as the Directors shall
appoint and if no other time and place is prescribed by them, it shall be held
at the Registered Office on the second Wednesday in December of each year at
ten oclock in the morning. At these meetings the report of the Directors (if
any) shall be presented.

 



 

19.3 The Directors may call general meetings, and they shall on a Members
requisition forthwith proceed to convene an extraordinary general meeting of
the Company.

 



 

19.4 A Members requisition is a requisition of Members holding at the date of
deposit of the requisition not less than ten per cent. in par value of the
issued Shares which as at that date carry the right to vote at general
meetings of the Company.

 



 

19.5 The Members requisition must state the objects of the meeting and must
be signed by the requisitionists and deposited at the Registered Office, and
may consist of several documents in like form each signed by one or more
requisitionists.

 



 

19.6 If there are no Directors as at the date of the deposit of the Members
requisition or if the Directors do not within twenty-one days from the date of
the deposit of the Members requisition duly proceed to convene a general
meeting to be held within a further twenty-one days, the requisitionists, or
any of them representing more than one-half of the total voting rights of all
of the requisitionists, may themselves convene a general meeting, but any
meeting so convened shall be held no later than the day which falls three
months after the expiration of the said twenty-one day period.

 



 

19.7 A general meeting convened as aforesaid by requisitionists shall be
convened in the same manner as nearly as possible as that in which general
meetings are to be convened by Directors.

 



 

 **20** **Notice of General Meetings**

 



 

20.1 At least five clear days notice shall be given of any general meeting.
Every notice shall specify the place, the day and the hour of the meeting and
the general nature of the business to be conducted at the general meeting and
shall be given in the manner hereinafter mentioned or in such other manner if
any as may be prescribed by the Company, provided that a general meeting of
the Company shall, whether or not the notice specified in this Article has
been given and whether or not the provisions of the Articles regarding general
meetings have been complied with, be deemed to have been duly convened if it
is so agreed:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) in the case of an annual general meeting, by all of the Members entitled
to attend and vote thereat; and

 



 

(b) in the case of an extraordinary general meeting, by a majority in number
of the Members having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, together
holding not less than ninety five per cent. in par value of the Shares giving
that right.

 



 

20.2 The accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting to, or the
non receipt of notice of a general meeting by, any person entitled to receive
such notice shall not invalidate the proceedings of that general meeting.

 



 

 **21** **Proceedings at General Meetings**

 



 

21.1 No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is
present. Two Members being individuals present in person or by proxy or if a
corporation or other non-natural person by its duly authorised representative
or proxy shall be a quorum unless the Company has only one Member entitled to
vote at such general meeting in which case the quorum shall be that one Member
present in person or by proxy or (in the case of a corporation or other non-
natural person) by its duly authorised representative or proxy.

 



 

21.2 A person may participate at a general meeting by conference telephone or
other communications equipment by means of which all the persons participating
in the meeting can communicate with each other. Participation by a person in a
general meeting in this manner is treated as presence in person at that
meeting.

 



 

21.3 A resolution (including a Special Resolution) in writing (in one or more
counterparts) signed by or on behalf of all of the Members for the time being
entitled to receive notice of and to attend and vote at general meetings (or,
being corporations or other non-natural persons, signed by their duly
authorised representatives) shall be as valid and effective as if the
resolution had been passed at a general meeting of the Company duly convened
and held.

 



 

21.4 If a quorum is not present within half an hour from the time appointed
for the meeting to commence or if during such a meeting a quorum ceases to be
present, the meeting, if convened upon a Members requisition, shall be
dissolved and in any other case it shall stand adjourned to the same day in
the next week at the same time and/or place or to such other day, time and/or
place as the Directors may determine, and if at the adjourned meeting a quorum
is not present within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting to
commence, the Members present shall be a quorum.

 



 

21.5 The Directors may, at any time prior to the time appointed for the
meeting to commence, appoint any person to act as chairman of a general
meeting of the Company or, if the Directors do not make any such appointment,
the chairman, if any, of the board of Directors shall preside as chairman at
such general meeting. If there is no such chairman, or if he shall not be
present within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to
commence, or is unwilling to act, the Directors present shall elect one of
their number to be chairman of the meeting.

 



 

21.6 If no Director is willing to act as chairman or if no Director is present
within fifteen minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to commence,
the Members present shall choose one of their number to be chairman of the
meeting.

 



      
 

 



 

21.7 The chairman may, with the consent of a meeting at which a quorum is
present (and shall if so directed by the meeting) adjourn the meeting from
time to time and from place to place, but no business shall be transacted at
any adjourned meeting other than the business left unfinished at the meeting
from which the adjournment took place.

 



 

21.8 When a general meeting is adjourned for thirty days or more, notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting.
Otherwise it shall not be necessary to give any such notice of an adjourned
meeting.

 



 

21.9 A resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of
hands unless before, or on the declaration of the result of, the show of
hands, the chairman demands a poll, or any other Member or Members
collectively present in person or by proxy (or in the case of a corporation or
other non-natural person, by its duly authorised representative or proxy) and
holding at least ten per cent. in par value of the Shares giving a right to
attend and vote at the meeting demand a poll.

 



 

21.10 Unless a poll is duly demanded and the demand is not withdrawn a
declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried or carried
unanimously, or by a particular majority, or lost or not carried by a
particular majority, an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceedings
of the meeting shall be conclusive evidence of that fact without proof of the
number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against such
resolution.

 



 

21.11 The demand for a poll may be withdrawn.

 



 

21.12 Except on a poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question
of adjournment, a poll shall be taken as the chairman directs, and the result
of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the general meeting at
which the poll was demanded.

 



 

21.13 A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of
adjournment shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any other question
shall be taken at such date, time and place as the chairman of the general
meeting directs, and any business other than that upon which a poll has been
demanded or is contingent thereon may proceed pending the taking of the poll.

 



 

21.14 In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or on a
poll, the chairman shall be entitled to a second or casting vote.

 



 

 **22** **Votes of Members**

 



 

22.1 Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any Shares, on a show
of hands every Member who (being an individual) is present in person or by
proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person is present by its duly
authorised representative or by proxy, shall have one vote and on a poll every
Member present in any such manner shall have one vote for every Share of which
he is the holder.

 



 

22.2 In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior holder who tenders a
vote, whether in person or by proxy (or, in the case of a corporation or other
non-natural person, by its duly authorised representative or proxy), shall be
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders
stand in the Register of Members.

 



      
 

 



 

22.3 A Member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has been made by
any court, having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a show of hands
or on a poll, by his committee, receiver, curator bonis, or other person on
such Members behalf appointed by that court, and any such committee,
receiver, curator bonis or other person may vote by proxy.

 



 

22.4 No person shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting unless he is
registered as a Member on the record date for such meeting nor unless all
calls or other monies then payable by him in respect of Shares have been paid.

 



 

22.5 No objection shall be raised as to the qualification of any voter except
at the general meeting or adjourned general meeting at which the vote objected
to is given or tendered and every vote not disallowed at the meeting shall be
valid. Any objection made in due time in accordance with this Article shall be
referred to the chairman whose decision shall be final and conclusive.

 



 

22.6 On a poll or on a show of hands votes may be cast either personally or by
proxy (or in the case of a corporation or other non-natural person by its duly
authorised representative or proxy). A Member may appoint more than one proxy
or the same proxy under one or more instruments to attend and vote at a
meeting. Where a Member appoints more than one proxy the instrument of proxy
shall state which proxy is entitled to vote on a show of hands and shall
specify the number of Shares in respect of which each proxy is entitled to
exercise the related votes.

 



 

22.7 On a poll, a Member holding more than one Share need not cast the votes
in respect of his Shares in the same way on any resolution and therefore may
vote a Share or some or all such Shares either for or against a resolution
and/or abstain from voting a Share or some or all of the Shares and, subject
to the terms of the instrument appointing him, a proxy appointed under one or
more instruments may vote a Share or some or all of the Shares in respect of
which he is appointed either for or against a resolution and/or abstain from
voting a Share or some or all of the Shares in respect of which he is
appointed.

 



 

 **23** **Proxies**

 



 

23.1 The instrument appointing a proxy shall be in writing and shall be
executed under the hand of the appointor or of his attorney duly authorised in
writing, or, if the appointor is a corporation or other non natural person,
under the hand of its duly authorised representative. A proxy need not be a
Member.

 



 

23.2 The Directors may, in the notice convening any meeting or adjourned
meeting, or in an instrument of proxy sent out by the Company, specify the
manner by which the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited and the
place and the time (being not later than the time appointed for the
commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which the proxy relates)
at which the instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited. In the absence
of any such direction from the Directors in the notice convening any meeting
or adjourned meeting or in an instrument of proxy sent out by the Company, the
instrument appointing a proxy shall be deposited physically at the Registered
Office not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the meeting or
adjourned meeting to commence at which the person named in the instrument
proposes to vote.

 



 

23.3 The chairman may in any event at his discretion declare that an
instrument of proxy shall be deemed to have been duly deposited. An instrument
of proxy that is not deposited in the manner permitted, or which has not been
declared to have been duly deposited by the chairman, shall be invalid.

 



      
 

 



 

23.4 The instrument appointing a proxy may be in any usual or common form (or
such other form as the Directors may approve) and may be expressed to be for a
particular meeting or any adjournment thereof or generally until revoked. An
instrument appointing a proxy shall be deemed to include the power to demand
or join or concur in demanding a poll.

 



 

23.5 Votes given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy shall
be valid notwithstanding the previous death or insanity of the principal or
revocation of the proxy or of the authority under which the proxy was
executed, or the transfer of the Share in respect of which the proxy is given
unless notice in writing of such death, insanity, revocation or transfer was
received by the Company at the Registered Office before the commencement of
the general meeting, or adjourned meeting at which it is sought to use the
proxy.

 



 

 **24** **Corporate Members**

 



 

Any corporation or other non-natural person which is a Member may in
accordance with its constitutional documents, or in the absence of such
provision by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise
such person as it thinks fit to act as its representative at any meeting of
the Company or of any class of Members, and the person so authorised shall be
entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation which he
represents as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual Member.

 



 

 **25** **Shares that May Not be Voted**

 



 

Shares in the Company that are beneficially owned by the Company shall not be
voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in
determining the total number of outstanding Shares at any given time.

 



 

 **26** **Directors**

 



 

There shall be a board of Directors consisting of not less than one person
(exclusive of alternate Directors) provided however that the Company may by
Ordinary Resolution increase or reduce the limits in the number of Directors.

 



 

 **27** **Powers of Directors**

 



 

27.1 Subject to the provisions of the Statute, the Memorandum and the Articles
and to any directions given by Special Resolution, the business of the Company
shall be managed by the Directors who may exercise all the powers of the
Company. No alteration of the Memorandum or Articles and no such direction
shall invalidate any prior act of the Directors which would have been valid if
that alteration had not been made or that direction had not been given. A duly
convened meeting of Directors at which a quorum is present may exercise all
powers exercisable by the Directors.

 



 

27.2 All cheques, promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange and other
negotiable or transferable instruments and all receipts for monies paid to the
Company shall be signed, drawn, accepted, endorsed or otherwise executed as
the case may be in such manner as the Directors shall determine by resolution.

 



 

27.3 The Directors on behalf of the Company may pay a gratuity or pension or
allowance on retirement to any Director who has held any other salaried office
or place of profit with the Company or to his widow or dependants and may make
contributions to any fund and pay premiums for the purchase or provision of
any such gratuity, pension or allowance.

 



      
 

 



 

27.4 The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money
and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and assets (present and
future) and uncalled capital or any part thereof and to issue debentures,
debenture stock, mortgages, bonds and other such securities whether outright
or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any
third party.

 

 ** **

 

 **28** **Appointment and Removal of Directors**

 



 

28.1 The Company may by Ordinary Resolution appoint any person to be a
Director or may by Ordinary Resolution remove any Director.

 



 

28.2 The Directors may appoint any person to be a Director, either to fill a
vacancy or as an additional Director provided that the appointment does not
cause the number of Directors to exceed any number fixed by or in accordance
with the Articles as the maximum number of Directors.

 



 

 **29** **Vacation of Office of Director**

 



 

The office of a Director shall be vacated if:

 



 

(a) the Director gives notice in writing to the Company that he resigns the
office of Director; or

 



 

(b) the Director absents himself (for the avoidance of doubt, without being
represented by proxy or an alternate Director appointed by him) from three
consecutive meetings of the board of Directors without special leave of
absence from the Directors, and the Directors pass a resolution that he has by
reason of such absence vacated office; or

 



 

(c) the Director dies, becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or
composition with his creditors generally; or

 



 

(d) the Director is found to be or becomes of unsound mind; or

 



 

(e) all of the other Directors (being not less than two in number) determine
that he should be removed as a Director, either by a resolution passed by all
of the other Directors at a meeting of the Directors duly convened and held in
accordance with the Articles or by a resolution in writing signed by all of
the other Directors.

 



 

 **30** **Proceedings of Directors**

 



 

30.1 The quorum for the transaction of the business of the Directors may be
fixed by the Directors, and unless so fixed shall be two if there are two or
more Directors, and shall be one if there is only one Director. A person who
holds office as an alternate Director shall, if his appointor is not present,
be counted in the quorum. A Director who also acts as an alternate Director
shall, if his appointor is not present, count twice towards the quorum.

 



 

30.2 Subject to the provisions of the Articles, the Directors may regulate
their proceedings as they think fit. Questions arising at any meeting shall be
decided by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes, the
chairman shall have a second or casting vote. A Director who is also an
alternate Director shall be entitled in the absence of his appointor to a
separate vote on behalf of his appointor in addition to his own vote.

 



      
 

 



 

30.3 A person may participate in a meeting of the Directors or any committee
of Directors by conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all the persons participating in the meeting can communicate
with each other at the same time. Participation by a person in a meeting in
this manner is treated as presence in person at that meeting. Unless otherwise
determined by the Directors the meeting shall be deemed to be held at the
place where the chairman is located at the start of the meeting.

 



 

30.4 A resolution in writing (in one or more counterparts) signed by all the
Directors or all the members of a committee of the Directors or, in the case
of a resolution in writing relating to the removal of any Director or the
vacation of office by any Director, all of the Directors other than the
Director who is the subject of such resolution (an alternate Director being
entitled to sign such a resolution on behalf of his appointor and if such
alternate Director is also a Director, being entitled to sign such resolution
both on behalf of his appointer and in his capacity as a Director) shall be as
valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the Directors, or
committee of Directors as the case may be, duly convened and held.

 



 

30.5 A Director or alternate Director may, or other officer of the Company on
the direction of a Director or alternate Director shall, call a meeting of the
Directors by at least two days notice in writing to every Director and
alternate Director which notice shall set forth the general nature of the
business to be considered unless notice is waived by all the Directors (or
their alternates) either at, before or after the meeting is held. To any such
notice of a meeting of the Directors all the provisions of the Articles
relating to the giving of notices by the Company to the Members shall apply
_mutatis mutandis._

 



 

30.6 The continuing Directors (or a sole continuing Director, as the case may
be) may act notwithstanding any vacancy in their body, but if and so long as
their number is reduced below the number fixed by or pursuant to the Articles
as the necessary quorum of Directors the continuing Directors or Director may
act for the purpose of increasing the number of Directors to be equal to such
fixed number, or of summoning a general meeting of the Company, but for no
other purpose.

 



 

30.7 The Directors may elect a chairman of their board and determine the
period for which he is to hold office; but if no such chairman is elected, or
if at any meeting the chairman is not present within five minutes after the
time appointed for the meeting to commence, the Directors present may choose
one of their number to be chairman of the meeting.

 



 

30.8 All acts done by any meeting of the Directors or of a committee of the
Directors (including any person acting as an alternate Director) shall,
notwithstanding that it is afterwards discovered that there was some defect in
the appointment of any Director or alternate Director, and/or that they or any
of them were disqualified, and/or had vacated their office and/or were not
entitled to vote, be as valid as if every such person had been duly appointed
and/or not disqualified to be a Director or alternate Director and/or had not
vacated their office and/or had been entitled to vote, as the case may be.

 



 

30.9 A Director but not an alternate Director may be represented at any
meetings of the board of Directors by a proxy appointed in writing by him. The
proxy shall count towards the quorum and the vote of the proxy shall for all
purposes be deemed to be that of the appointing Director.

 



      
 

 



 

 **31** **Presumption of Assent**

 



 

A Director or alternate Director who is present at a meeting of the board of
Directors at which action on any Company matter is taken shall be presumed to
have assented to the action taken unless his dissent shall be entered in the
minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file his written dissent from such
action with the person acting as the chairman or secretary of the meeting
before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered
post to such person immediately after the adjournment of the meeting. Such
right to dissent shall not apply to a Director or alternate Director who voted
in favour of such action.

 

 ** **

 

 **32** **Directors  Interests**

 



 

32.1 A Director or alternate Director may hold any other office or place of
profit under the Company (other than the office of Auditor) in conjunction
with his office of Director for such period and on such terms as to
remuneration and otherwise as the Directors may determine.

 



 

32.2 A Director or alternate Director may act by himself or by, through or on
behalf of his firm in a professional capacity for the Company and he or his
firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were
not a Director or alternate Director.

 



 

32.3 A Director or alternate Director may be or become a director or other
officer of or otherwise interested in any company promoted by the Company or
in which the Company may be interested as a shareholder, a contracting party
or otherwise, and no such Director or alternate Director shall be accountable
to the Company for any remuneration or other benefits received by him as a
director or officer of, or from his interest in, such other company.

 



 

32.4 No person shall be disqualified from the office of Director or alternate
Director or prevented by such office from contracting with the Company, either
as vendor, purchaser or otherwise, nor shall any such contract or any contract
or transaction entered into by or on behalf of the Company in which any
Director or alternate Director shall be in any way interested be or be liable
to be avoided, nor shall any Director or alternate Director so contracting or
being so interested be liable to account to the Company for any profit
realised by or arising in connection with any such contract or transaction by
reason of such Director or alternate Director holding office or of the
fiduciary relationship thereby established. A Director (or his alternate
Director in his absence) shall be at liberty to vote in respect of any
contract or transaction in which he is interested provided that the nature of
the interest of any Director or alternate Director in any such contract or
transaction shall be disclosed by him at or prior to its consideration and any
vote thereon.

 



 

32.5 A general notice that a Director or alternate Director is a shareholder,
director, officer or employee of any specified firm or company and is to be
regarded as interested in any transaction with such firm or company shall be
sufficient disclosure for the purposes of voting on a resolution in respect of
a contract or transaction in which he has an interest, and after such general
notice it shall not be necessary to give special notice relating to any
particular transaction.

 



 

 **33** **Minutes**

 



 

The Directors shall cause minutes to be made in books kept for the purpose of
recording all appointments of officers made by the Directors, all proceedings
at meetings of the Company or the holders of any class of Shares and of the
Directors, and of committees of the Directors, including the names of the
Directors or alternate Directors present at each meeting.

 



      
 

 

 ** **

 

 **34** **Delegation of Directors  Powers**

 



 

34.1 The Directors may delegate any of their powers, authorities and
discretions, including the power to sub-delegate, to any committee consisting
of one or more Directors. They may also delegate to any managing director or
any Director holding any other executive office such of their powers,
authorities and discretions as they consider desirable to be exercised by him
provided that an alternate Director may not act as managing director and the
appointment of a managing director shall be revoked forthwith if he ceases to
be a Director. Any such delegation may be made subject to any conditions the
Directors may impose and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of their
own powers and any such delegation may be revoked or altered by the Directors.
Subject to any such conditions, the proceedings of a committee of Directors
shall be governed by the Articles regulating the proceedings of Directors, so
far as they are capable of applying.

 



 

34.2 The Directors may establish any committees, local boards or agencies or
appoint any person to be a manager or agent for managing the affairs of the
Company and may appoint any person to be a member of such committees, local
boards or agencies. Any such appointment may be made subject to any conditions
the Directors may impose, and either collaterally with or to the exclusion of
their own powers and any such appointment may be revoked or altered by the
Directors. Subject to any such conditions, the proceedings of any such
committee, local board or agency shall be governed by the Articles regulating
the proceedings of Directors, so far as they are capable of applying.

 



 

34.3 The Directors may by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any person to
be the agent of the Company on such conditions as the Directors may determine,
provided that the delegation is not to the exclusion of their own powers and
may be revoked by the Directors at any time.

 



 

34.4 The Directors may by power of attorney or otherwise appoint any company,
firm, person or body of persons, whether nominated directly or indirectly by
the Directors, to be the attorney or authorised signatory of the Company for
such purpose and with such powers, authorities and discretions (not exceeding
those vested in or exercisable by the Directors under the Articles) and for
such period and subject to such conditions as they may think fit, and any such
powers of attorney or other appointment may contain such provisions for the
protection and convenience of persons dealing with any such attorneys or
authorised signatories as the Directors may think fit and may also authorise
any such attorney or authorised signatory to delegate all or any of the
powers, authorities and discretions vested in him.

 



 

34.5 The Directors may appoint such officers of the Company (including, for
the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, any secretary) as they consider
necessary on such terms, at such remuneration and to perform such duties, and
subject to such provisions as to disqualification and removal as the Directors
may think fit. Unless otherwise specified in the terms of his appointment an
officer of the Company may be removed by resolution of the Directors or
Members. An officer of the Company may vacate his office at any time if he
gives notice in writing to the Company that he resigns his office.

 



 

 **35** **Alternate Directors**

 



 

35.1 Any Director (but not an alternate Director) may by writing appoint any
other Director, or any other person willing to act, to be an alternate
Director and by writing may remove from office an alternate Director so
appointed by him.

 



      
 

 



 

35.2 An alternate Director shall be entitled to receive notice of all meetings
of Directors and of all meetings of committees of Directors of which his
appointor is a member, to attend and vote at every such meeting at which the
Director appointing him is not personally present, to sign any written
resolution of the Directors, and generally to perform all the functions of his
appointor as a Director in his absence.

 



 

35.3 An alternate Director shall cease to be an alternate Director if his
appointor ceases to be a Director.

 



 

35.4 Any appointment or removal of an alternate Director shall be by notice to
the Company signed by the Director making or revoking the appointment or in
any other manner approved by the Directors.

 



 

35.5 Subject to the provisions of the Articles, an alternate Director shall be
deemed for all purposes to be a Director and shall alone be responsible for
his own acts and defaults and shall not be deemed to be the agent of the
Director appointing him.

 



 

 **36** **No Minimum Shareholding**

 



 

The Company in general meeting may fix a minimum shareholding required to be
held by a Director, but unless and until such a shareholding qualification is
fixed a Director is not required to hold Shares.

 



 

 **37** **Remuneration of Directors**

 



 

37.1 The remuneration to be paid to the Directors, if any, shall be such
remuneration as the Directors shall determine. The Directors shall also be
entitled to be paid all travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred
by them in connection with their attendance at meetings of Directors or
committees of Directors, or general meetings of the Company, or separate
meetings of the holders of any class of Shares or debentures of the Company,
or otherwise in connection with the business of the Company or the discharge
of their duties as a Director, or to receive a fixed allowance in respect
thereof as may be determined by the Directors, or a combination partly of one
such method and partly the other.

 



 

37.2 The Directors may by resolution approve additional remuneration to any
Director for any services which in the opinion of the Directors go beyond his
ordinary routine work as a Director. Any fees paid to a Director who is also
counsel, attorney or solicitor to the Company, or otherwise serves it in a
professional capacity shall be in addition to his remuneration as a Director.

 



 

 **38** **Seal**

 



 

38.1 The Company may, if the Directors so determine, have a Seal. The Seal
shall only be used by the authority of the Directors or of a committee of the
Directors authorised by the Directors. Every instrument to which the Seal has
been affixed shall be signed by at least one person who shall be either a
Director or some officer of the Company or other person appointed by the
Directors for the purpose.

 



 

38.2 The Company may have for use in any place or places outside the Cayman
Islands a duplicate Seal or Seals each of which shall be a facsimile of the
common Seal of the Company and, if the Directors so determine, with the
addition on its face of the name of every place where it is to be used.

 



      
 

 



 

38.3 A Director or officer, representative or attorney of the Company may
without further authority of the Directors affix the Seal over his signature
alone to any document of the Company required to be authenticated by him under
seal or to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in the Cayman Islands or
elsewhere wheresoever.

 



 

 **39** **Dividends, Distributions and Reserve**

 



 

39.1 Subject to the Statute and this Article and except as otherwise provided
by the rights attached to any Shares, the Directors may resolve to pay
Dividends and other distributions on Shares in issue and authorise payment of
the Dividends or other distributions out of the funds of the Company lawfully
available therefor. A Dividend shall be deemed to be an interim Dividend
unless the terms of the resolution pursuant to which the Directors resolve to
pay such Dividend specifically state that such Dividend shall be a final
Dividend. No Dividend or other distribution shall be paid except out of the
realised or unrealised profits of the Company, out of the share premium
account or as otherwise permitted by law.

 



 

39.2 Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any Shares, all
Dividends and other distributions shall be paid according to the par value of
the Shares that a Member holds. If any Share is issued on terms providing that
it shall rank for Dividend as from a particular date, that Share shall rank
for Dividend accordingly.

 



 

39.3 The Directors may deduct from any Dividend or other distribution payable
to any Member all sums of money (if any) then payable by him to the Company on
account of calls or otherwise.

 



 

39.4 The Directors may resolve that any Dividend or other distribution be paid
wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular (but
without limitation) by the distribution of shares, debentures, or securities
of any other company or in any one or more of such ways and where any
difficulty arises in regard to such distribution, the Directors may settle the
same as they think expedient and in particular may issue fractional Shares and
may fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof
and may determine that cash payments shall be made to any Members upon the
basis of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of all Members and
may vest any such specific assets in trustees in such manner as may seem
expedient to the Directors.

 



 

39.5 Except as otherwise provided by the rights attached to any Shares,
Dividends and other distributions may be paid in any currency. The Directors
may determine the basis of conversion for any currency conversions that may be
required and how any costs involved are to be met.

 



 

39.6 The Directors may, before resolving to pay any Dividend or other
distribution, set aside such sums as they think proper as a reserve or
reserves which shall, at the discretion of the Directors, be applicable for
any purpose of the Company and pending such application may, at the discretion
of the Directors, be employed in the business of the Company.

 



 

39.7 Any Dividend, other distribution, interest or other monies payable in
cash in respect of Shares may be paid by wire transfer to the holder or by
cheque or warrant sent through the post directed to the registered address of
the holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the registered address of the
holder who is first named on the Register of Members or to such person and to
such address as such holder or joint holders may in writing direct. Every such
cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of the person to whom it
is sent. Any one of two or more joint holders may give effectual receipts for
any Dividends, other distributions, bonuses, or other monies payable in
respect of the Share held by them as joint holders.

 



      
 

 



 

39.8 No Dividend or other distribution shall bear interest against the
Company.

 



 

39.9 Any Dividend or other distribution which cannot be paid to a Member
and/or which remains unclaimed after six months from the date on which such
Dividend or other distribution becomes payable may, in the discretion of the
Directors, be paid into a separate account in the Companys name, provided
that the Company shall not be constituted as a trustee in respect of that
account and the Dividend or other distribution shall remain as a debt due to
the Member. Any Dividend or other distribution which remains unclaimed after a
period of six years from the date on which such Dividend or other distribution
becomes payable shall be forfeited and shall revert to the Company.

 

 ** **

 

 **40** **Capitalisation**

 



 

The Directors may at any time capitalise any sum standing to the credit of any
of the Companys reserve accounts or funds (including the share premium
account and capital redemption reserve fund) or any sum standing to the credit
of the profit and loss account or otherwise available for distribution;
appropriate such sum to Members in the proportions in which such sum would
have been divisible amongst such Members had the same been a distribution of
profits by way of Dividend or other distribution; and apply such sum on their
behalf in paying up in full unissued Shares for allotment and distribution
credited as fully paid-up to and amongst them in the proportion aforesaid. In
such event the Directors shall do all acts and things required to give effect
to such capitalisation, with full power given to the Directors to make such
provisions as they think fit in the case of Shares becoming distributable in
fractions (including provisions whereby the benefit of fractional entitlements
accrue to the Company rather than to the Members concerned). The Directors may
authorise any person to enter on behalf of all of the Members interested into
an agreement with the Company providing for such capitalisation and matters
incidental or relating thereto and any agreement made under such authority
shall be effective and binding on all such Members and the Company.

 



 

 **41** **Books of Account**

 



 

41.1 The Directors shall cause proper books of account (including, where
applicable, material underlying documentation including contracts and
invoices) to be kept with respect to all sums of money received and expended
by the Company and the matters in respect of which the receipt or expenditure
takes place, all sales and purchases of goods by the Company and the assets
and liabilities of the Company. Such books of account must be retained for a
minimum period of five years from the date on which they are prepared. Proper
books shall not be deemed to be kept if there are not kept such books of
account as are necessary to give a true and fair view of the state of the
Companys affairs and to explain its transactions.

 



 

41.2 The Directors shall determine whether and to what extent and at what
times and places and under what conditions or regulations the accounts and
books of the Company or any of them shall be open to the inspection of Members
not being Directors and no Member (not being a Director) shall have any right
of inspecting any account or book or document of the Company except as
conferred by Statute or authorised by the Directors or by the Company in
general meeting.

 



 

41.3 The Directors may cause to be prepared and to be laid before the Company
in general meeting profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, group accounts
(if any) and such other reports and accounts as may be required by law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **42** **Audit**

 



 

42.1 The Directors may appoint an Auditor of the Company who shall hold office
on such terms as the Directors determine.

 



 

42.2 Every Auditor of the Company shall have a right of access at all times to
the books and accounts and vouchers of the Company and shall be entitled to
require from the Directors and officers of the Company such information and
explanation as may be necessary for the performance of the duties of the
Auditor.

 



 

42.3 Auditors shall, if so required by the Directors, make a report on the
accounts of the Company during their tenure of office at the next annual
general meeting following their appointment in the case of a company which is
registered with the Registrar of Companies as an ordinary company, and at the
next extraordinary general meeting following their appointment in the case of
a company which is registered with the Registrar of Companies as an exempted
company, and at any other time during their term of office, upon request of
the Directors or any general meeting of the Members.

 



 

 **43** **Notices**

 



 

43.1 Notices shall be in writing and may be given by the Company to any Member
either personally or by sending it by courier, post, cable, telex, fax or
e-mail to him or to his address as shown in the Register of Members (or where
the notice is given by e-mail by sending it to the e-mail address provided by
such Member). Any notice, if posted from one country to another, is to be sent
by airmail.

 



 

43.2 Where a notice is sent by courier, service of the notice shall be deemed
to be effected by delivery of the notice to a courier company, and shall be
deemed to have been received on the third day (not including Saturdays or
Sundays or public holidays) following the day on which the notice was
delivered to the courier. Where a notice is sent by post, service of the
notice shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, pre paying and
posting a letter containing the notice, and shall be deemed to have been
received on the fifth day (not including Saturdays or Sundays or public
holidays in the Cayman Islands) following the day on which the notice was
posted. Where a notice is sent by cable, telex or fax, service of the notice
shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing and sending such notice
and shall be deemed to have been received on the same day that it was
transmitted. Where a notice is given by e-mail service shall be deemed to be
effected by transmitting the e-mail to the e-mail address provided by the
intended recipient and shall be deemed to have been received on the same day
that it was sent, and it shall not be necessary for the receipt of the e-mail
to be acknowledged by the recipient.

 



 

43.3 A notice may be given by the Company to the person or persons which the
Company has been advised are entitled to a Share or Shares in consequence of
the death or bankruptcy of a Member in the same manner as other notices which
are required to be given under the Articles and shall be addressed to them by
name, or by the title of representatives of the deceased, or trustee of the
bankrupt, or by any like description at the address supplied for that purpose
by the persons claiming to be so entitled, or at the option of the Company by
giving the notice in any manner in which the same might have been given if the
death or bankruptcy had not occurred.

 



 

43.4 Notice of every general meeting shall be given in any manner authorised
by the Articles to every holder of Shares carrying an entitlement to receive
such notice on the record date for such meeting except that in the case of
joint holders the notice shall be sufficient if given to the joint

 



      
 

 



 

holder first named in the Register of Members and every person upon whom the
ownership of a Share devolves by reason of his being a legal personal
representative or a trustee in bankruptcy of a Member where the Member but for
his death or bankruptcy would be entitled to receive notice of the meeting,
and no other person shall be entitled to receive notices of general meetings.

 



 

 **44** **Winding Up**

 



 

44.1 If the Company shall be wound up the liquidator shall apply the assets of
the Company in satisfaction of creditors claims in such manner and order as
such liquidator thinks fit. Subject to the rights attaching to any Shares, in
a winding up:

 



 

(a) if the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be
insufficient to repay the whole of the Companys issued share capital, such
assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses shall be
borne by the Members in proportion to the par value of the Shares held by
them; or

 



 

(b) if the assets available for distribution amongst the Members shall be more
than sufficient to repay the whole of the Companys issued share capital at
the commencement of the winding up, the surplus shall be distributed amongst
the Members in proportion to the par value of the Shares held by them at the
commencement of the winding up subject to a deduction from those Shares in
respect of which there are monies due, of all monies payable to the Company
for unpaid calls or otherwise.

 



 

44.2 If the Company shall be wound up the liquidator may, subject to the
rights attaching to any Shares and with the approval of a Special Resolution
of the Company and any other approval required by the Statute, divide amongst
the Members in kind the whole or any part of the assets of the Company
(whether such assets shall consist of property of the same kind or not) and
may for that purpose value any assets and determine how the division shall be
carried out as between the Members or different classes of Members. The
liquidator may, with the like approval, vest the whole or any part of such
assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of the Members as the
liquidator, with the like approval, shall think fit, but so that no Member
shall be compelled to accept any asset upon which there is a liability.

 



 

 **45** **Indemnity and Insurance**

 



 

45.1 Every Director and officer of the Company (which for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not include auditors of the Company), together with every former
Director and former officer of the Company (each an " **Indemnified Person**
") shall be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any
liability, action, proceeding, claim, demand, costs, damages or expenses,
including legal expenses, whatsoever which they or any of them may incur as a
result of any act or failure to act in carrying out their functions other than
such liability (if any) that they may incur by reason of their own actual
fraud or wilful default. No Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Company
for any loss or damage incurred by the Company as a result (whether direct or
indirect) of the carrying out of their functions unless that liability arises
through the actual fraud or wilful default of such Indemnified Person. No
person shall be found to have committed actual fraud or wilful default under
this Article unless or until a court of competent jurisdiction shall have made
a finding to that effect.

 



 

45.2 The Company shall advance to each Indemnified Person reasonable
attorneys fees and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
defence of any action, suit, proceeding or

 



      
 

 



 

investigation involving such Indemnified Person for which indemnity will or
could be sought. In connection with any advance of any expenses hereunder, the
Indemnified Person shall execute an undertaking to repay the advanced amount
to the Company if it shall be determined by final judgment or other final
adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article. If it shall be determined by a final judgment or
other final adjudication that such Indemnified Person was not entitled to
indemnification with respect to such judgment, costs or expenses, then such
party shall not be indemnified with respect to such judgment, costs or
expenses and any advancement shall be returned to the Company (without
interest) by the Indemnified Person.

 



 

45.3 The Directors, on behalf of the Company, may purchase and maintain
insurance for the benefit of any Director or other officer of the Company
against any liability which, by virtue of any rule of law, would otherwise
attach to such person in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or
breach of trust of which such person may be guilty in relation to the Company.

 

 ** **

 

 **46** **Financial Year**

 



 

Unless the Directors otherwise prescribe, the financial year of the Company
shall end on 31st December in each year and, following the year of
incorporation, shall begin on 1st January in each year.

 



 

 **47** **Transfer by Way of Continuation**

 



 

If the Company is exempted as defined in the Statute, it shall, subject to the
provisions of the Statute and with the approval of a Special Resolution, have
the power to register by way of continuation as a body corporate under the
laws of any jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands and to be deregistered in
the Cayman Islands.

 



 

 **48** **Mergers and Consolidations**

 



 

The Company shall have the power to merge or consolidate with one or more
other constituent companies (as defined in the Statute) upon such terms as the
Directors may determine and (to the extent required by the Statute) with the
approval of a Special Resolution.

The total number of shares of all classes of stock that the Corporation shall
have authority to issue is 250,000,000 shares, consisting solely of:

 



 

240,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " _Common
Stock_ "); and

 



 

10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_Preferred Stock_ ").

 



 

The following is a statement of the powers, designations, preferences,
privileges, and relative rights in respect of each class of capital stock of
the Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

A. COMMON STOCK.

 



 

1. _General_. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of Common Stock are subject to and qualified by the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock.

 



 

2. _Voting_. The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held at all meetings of stockholders. There shall be no cumulative voting.

 



 

3. _Dividends_. Dividends may be declared and paid on the Common Stock from funds lawfully available therefor if, as and when determined by the Board of Directors and subject to any preferential dividend rights of any then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

 



 

4. _Liquidation_. Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to receive all assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, subject to any preferential rights of any then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.

 



 

5. Subject to any rights of any then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the number of authorized shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL (or any successor provision thereto), and no vote of the holders of either the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock voting separately as a class shall be required therefor.

 



 

B. PREFERRED STOCK.

 



 

Shares of Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series, each of such series to have such powers, designations, preferences,
and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights, if any, and
such qualifications, limitations and restrictions, if any, of such preferences
and rights, as are stated or expressed in the resolution or resolutions of the
Board of Directors providing for such series of Preferred Stock.

 



 

Authority is hereby granted to the Board of Directors from time to time to
issue the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and in connection with the
creation of any such series, by resolution or resolutions to determine and fix
the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional,
or other special rights, if any, and the qualifications and restrictions, if
any, of such preferences and rights, including without limitation dividend
rights, conversion rights, voting rights (if any), redemption privileges, and
liquidation preferences, of such series of Preferred Stock (which need not be
uniform among series), all to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by
the DGCL. The powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights of each series of Preferred Stock, and the
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, if any, may differ from
those of any and all other series at any time outstanding. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the resolution or resolutions providing for
the creation or issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that
such series shall be superior to, rank equally with, or be junior to the
Preferred Stock of any other series, all to the fullest extent permitted by
law

 



      
 

 



 

Any resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to
the authority vested in them by this Article IV shall be set forth in a
certificate of designation along with the number of shares of stock of such
series as to which the resolution or resolutions shall apply and such
certificate shall be executed, acknowledged, filed, recorded, and shall become
effective, in accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL. Unless otherwise
provided in any such resolution or resolutions, the number of shares of stock
of any such series to which such resolution or resolutions apply may be
increased (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class)
or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by
a certificate likewise executed, acknowledged, filed and recorded, setting
forth a statement that a specified increase or decrease therein has been
authorized and directed by a resolution or resolutions likewise adopted by the
Board of Directors. In case the number of such shares shall be decreased, the
number of shares so specified in the certificate shall resume the status which
they had prior to the adoption of the first resolution or resolutions. When no
shares of any such class or series are outstanding, either because none were
issued or because none remain outstanding, a certificate setting forth a
resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors that none of the
authorized shares of such class or series are outstanding, and that none will
be issued subject to the certificate of designations previously filed with
respect to such class or series, may be executed, acknowledged, filed and
recorded in the same manner as previously described and it shall have the
effect of eliminating from this Restated Certificate of Incorporation all
matters set forth in the certificate of designations with respect to such
class or series of stock. If no shares of any such class or series established
by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors have been
issued, the voting powers, designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other rights, if any, with the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, may be amended by a resolution or
resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. In the event of any such
amendment, a certificate which (i) states that no shares of such class or
series have been issued, (ii) sets forth the copy of the amending resolution
or resolutions and (iii) if the designation of such class or series is being
changed, indicates the original designation and the new designation, shall be
executed, acknowledged, filed, recorded, and shall become effective, in
accordance with Section 103 of the DGCL.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise required by law, holders of
Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) that relates solely to
the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders
of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the
holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this
Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the
DGCL.

 



 

ARTICLE V 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 



 

The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and
for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation and for defining and
regulating the powers of the Corporation and its directors and stockholders
and are in furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon the
Corporation by statute:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) The number of directors constituting the full Board of Directors shall be
as determined from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the
total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies
in previously authorized directorships (the " _Whole Board_ "), in a manner
consistent (for so long as it remains in effect) with the Principal
Stockholders Agreement, dated [*], 2017, by and among the Corporation,
Heritage PE (OEP) II, L.P., Heritage PE (OEP) III, L.P. and certain other
stockholder parties thereto as such agreement may be amended from time to time
(the " _Stockholders Agreement_ "). Each director shall hold office until the
next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her respective successor
shall have been duly elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Except as
may otherwise be provided by the DGCL, the By-Laws of the Corporation or the
Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement is in
effect), any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from
office at any time, (a) for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of voting power of the shares of the Corporations stock entitled to
vote for the election of directors, voting together as a single class, or (b)
without cause by (i) subject to clause (ii), the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the shares of the
Corporations stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, voting
together as a single class or (ii) in the event recommended by at least two-
thirds of the Whole Board, including the approval of a majority of the
Independent Directors (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement,
the " _Independent Directors_ "), the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the shares of the Corporations stock entitled
to vote for the election of directors, voting as a single class.

 



 

(b) The Board of Directors shall have the power and authority: (i) to adopt,
amend or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation, by resolution of the Board of
Directors duly adopted by a majority of the directors then constituting the
full Board of Directors, including (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement
remains in effect) the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors;
and (ii) to the full extent permitted or not prohibited by law, and without
the consent of or other action by the stockholders, to authorize or create
mortgage, pledges or other liens or encumbrances upon any or all of the
assets, real, personal or mixed, and franchises of the Corporation, including
after-acquired property, and to exercise all of the powers of the Corporation
in connection therewith. With respect to the power of holders of capital stock
to adopt, amend and repeal By-Laws of the Corporation, notwithstanding any
provision of the By-Laws of the Corporation or any other provision that might
otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, in addition to any vote of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required in
the By-Laws of the Corporation or by law, the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the shares of the Corporations
stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, shall be
required for any such alteration, amendment, repeal, or adoption by the vote
of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation.

 



 

(c) Unless and except to the extent that the By-Laws of the Corporation shall
so require, the election of directors of the corporation need not be by
written ballot.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE VI 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 



 

No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation
or to any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such
liability; provided, however, that to the extent required from time to time by
applicable law, this Article VI shall not eliminate or limit the liability of
a director, to the extent such liability is provided by applicable law, (i)
for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174
of Title 8 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transactions from which the director
derived an improper personal benefit. No amendment to or repeal of this
Article VI shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged
liability of any director for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such
director occurring prior to the effective date of such amendment or repeal.

 



 

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the
DGCL, as amended from time to time, indemnify each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of being or having been a director or officer of
the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, serving or
having served at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an
employee benefit plan, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken
or omitted in such capacity, against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgements, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by him in
connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, and
such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a
director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent.

 



 

Indemnification may include payment by the Corporation of expenses in
defending an action or proceeding in advance of the final disposition of such
action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by the person indemnified
to repay such payment if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification under this Article VII, which undertaking may be
accepted without reference to the financial ability of such person to make
such repayment.

 



 

The Corporation shall not indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless
the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors.

 



 

The indemnification rights provided in this Article VII (i) shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be
entitled under any law, bylaw, agreement or vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, (ii) may, to the extent authorized from
time to time by the Board of Directors, be granted to any employee or agent of
the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII
with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors
and officers of the Corporation, and (iii) shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such persons. The Corporation may, to
the extent authorized from time to time by its Board of Directors, grant

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or
other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or
greater or less than, those set forth in this Article VII.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII 
COMPROMISES AND ARRANGEMENTS

 



 

Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and
its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its
stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within
the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary way of the
Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of
any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of
Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution
or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section
279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class
of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said
court directs. If a majority in number representing three fourths (3/4ths) in
value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or
class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any
compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as
consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or
arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to
which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders,
of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE IX 
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WITH INTERESTED STOCKHOLDERS

 



 

(a) The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the DGCL or this Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (including paragraph (a) of this Article IX), the
Corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested
stockholder for a period of three years following the time that such
stockholder became an interested stockholder unless:

 



 

(1) Prior to such time the Board of Directors of the Corporation approved
either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the
stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

 



 

(2) Upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least
85% of the voting stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time the
transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock
outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested
stockholder) those shares owned (i) by persons who are directors and also
officers and (ii) employee stock plans in which employee participants do not
have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the
plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or

 



      
 

 



 

(3) At or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by (i)
two-thirds of the Whole Board, and (ii) a majority of the Independent
Directors.

 



 

(c) The restrictions contained in this Article IX shall not apply if:

 



 

(1) A stockholder becomes an interested stockholder inadvertently and (i) as
soon as practicable divests itself of ownership of sufficient shares so that
the stockholder ceases to be an interested stockholder; and (ii) would not, at
any time within the three-year period immediately prior to a business
combination between the Corporation and such stockholder, have been an
interested stockholder but for the inadvertent acquisition of ownership; or

not opposed by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors then in
office (but not less than one) who were directors prior to any person becoming
an interested stockholder during the previous three years or were recommended
for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such
directors. The proposed transactions referred to in the preceding sentence are
limited to (x) a merger or consolidation of the Corporation (except for a
merger in respect of which, pursuant to Section 251(f) of the DGCL, no vote of
the stockholders of the Corporation is required); (y) a sale, lease, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition (in one transaction or a
series of transactions), whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of
assets of the Corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned
subsidiary of the Corporation (other than to any direct or indirect wholly-

to 50% or more of either that aggregate market value of all of the assets of
the Corporation determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market
value of all the outstanding stock of the Corporation; or (z) a proposed
tender or exchange offer for 50% or more of the outstanding voting stock of

more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, another person.

 



 

(2) " _Associate_ ," when used to indicate a relationship with any person,

interest or as to which such person serves as trustee or in a similar

 



      
 

 



 

fiduciary capacity; and (iii) any relative or spouse of such person, or any
relative of such spouse, who has the same residence as such person.

 



 

(3) " _Business combination_ ," when used in reference to the Corporation and
any interested stockholder of the Corporation, means:

 



 

(i) Any merger or consolidation of the Corporation or any direct or indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation with (A) the interested
stockholder, or (B) with any other corporation, partnership, unincorporated
association or other entity if the merger or consolidation is caused by the
interested stockholder and as a result of such merger or consolidation
subsection (b) of this Article IX is not applicable to the surviving entity;

 



 

(ii) Any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other
disposition (in one transaction or a series of transactions), except
proportionately as a stockholder of the Corporation, to or with the interested
stockholder, whether as part of a dissolution or otherwise, of assets of the
Corporation or of any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation which assets have an aggregate market value equal to 10% or more
of either the aggregate market value of all the assets of the Corporation
determined on a consolidated basis or the aggregate market value of all the
outstanding stock of the Corporation;

 



 

(iii) Any transaction which results in the issuance or transfer by the
Corporation or by any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the
Corporation of any stock of the Corporation or of such subsidiary to the
interested stockholder, except: (A) pursuant to the exercise, exchange or
conversion of securities exercisable for, exchangeable for or convertible into
stock of the Corporation or any such subsidiary which securities were
outstanding prior to the time that the interested stockholder became such; (B)
pursuant to a merger under Section 251(g) of the DGCL; (C) pursuant to a
dividend or distribution paid or made, or the exercise, exchange or conversion

the time the interested stockholder became such; (D) pursuant to an exchange
offer by the Corporation to purchase stock made on the same terms to all

proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the Corporation or
of the voting stock of the Corporation;

 



 

(iv) Any transaction involving the Corporation or any direct or indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation which has the effect, directly or
indirectly, of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or
series, or securities convertible into the stock of any class or series, of
the Corporation or of any such subsidiary which is owned by the interested
stockholder, except as a result of immaterial changes due to fractional share
adjustments or as a result of any purchase or redemption of any shares of
stock not caused, directly or indirectly, by the interested stockholder; or

 



      
 

 



 

(v) Any receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit, directly or

"under common control with," means the possession, directly or indirectly, of
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a
person, whether through the ownership of voting stock, by contract or
otherwise. A person who is the owner of 20% or more of the outstanding voting
stock of any corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other
entity shall be presumed to have control of such entity, in the absence of
proof by a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a presumption of control shall not apply where such person holds
voting stock, in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this
Article IX, as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian or trustee for one
or more owners who do not individually or as a group have control of such
entity.

 



 

(5) " _Interested stockholder_ " means any person (other than the Corporation
and any direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Corporation) that
(i) is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the
Corporation, or (ii) is an affiliate or associate of the Corporation and was
the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the Corporation at
any time within the three-year period immediately prior to the date on which
it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested
stockholder, and the affiliates and associates of such person; provided,
however, that the term "interested stockholder" shall not include any person
whose ownership of shares in excess of the 15% limitation set forth herein is
the result of action taken solely by the Corporation; provided that such
person shall be an interested stockholder if thereafter such person acquires
additional shares of voting stock of the Corporation, except as a result of
further corporate action by the Corporation not caused, directly or
indirectly, by such person. For the purpose of determining whether a person is
an interested stockholder, the voting stock of the Corporation deemed to be
outstanding shall include stock deemed to be owned by the person through
application of paragraph (6) of this subsection (d) but shall not include any
other unissued stock of the Corporation which may be issuable pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon exercise of conversion
rights, warrants or options, or otherwise.

 



 

(6) " _Owner_ ," including the terms "own" and "owned," when used with respect
to any stock, means a person that individually or with or through any of its
affiliates or associates:

 



 

(i) Beneficially owns such stock, directly or indirectly; or

 



 

(ii) Has (A) the right to acquire such stock (whether such right is
exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time) pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion
rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise; provided, however,
that a person shall not be deemed the owner of stock tendered pursuant to a
tender or exchange offer made by such person or any

 



      
 

 



 

of such persons affiliates or associates until such tendered stock is
accepted for purchase or exchange; or (B) the right to vote such stock
pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding; provided, however,
that a person shall not be deemed the owner of any stock because of such
persons right to vote such stock if the agreement, arrangement or
understanding to vote such stock arises solely from a revocable proxy or
consent given in response to a proxy or consent solicitation made to ten or
more persons; or

 



 

(iii) Has any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, voting (except voting pursuant to a revocable proxy or
consent as described in item (B) of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph (6)),
or disposing of such stock with any other person that beneficially owns, or
whose affiliates or associates beneficially own, directly or indirectly, such
stock.

 



 

(7) " _Person_ " means any individual, corporation, partnership,
unincorporated association or other entity.

 



 

(8) " _Stock_ " means, with respect to any corporation, capital stock and,
with respect to any other entity, any equity interest.

 



 

(9) " _Voting stock_ " means, with respect to any corporation, stock of any
class or series entitled to vote generally in the election of directors and,
with respect to any entity that is not a corporation, any equity interest
entitled to vote generally in the election of the governing body of such
entity. Every reference to a percentage of voting stock shall refer to such
percentage of the votes of such voting stock.

 



 

ARTICLE X 
CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

 



 

The Board of Directors, when considering a tender offer or merger or
acquisition proposal, may, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
take into account factors in addition to potential economic benefits to
stockholders, including without limitation (i) comparison of the proposed
consideration to be received by stockholders in relation to the then current
market price of the Corporations capital stock, the estimated current value
of the Corporation in a freely negotiated transaction, and the estimated
future value of the Corporation as an independent entity, (ii) the impact of
such a transaction on the employees, suppliers, and customers of the
Corporation and its effect on the communities in which the Corporation
operates, and (iii) the impact of such a transaction on the unique corporate
culture and atmosphere of the Corporation.

 



 

For so long as the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect, the Corporation
shall not, either directly or indirectly by amendment, merger, consolidation,
waiver or otherwise, take any action or enter into any transaction that would
violate or conflict with any provision of the Stockholders Agreement requiring
the written consent, waiver or affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors (or of a specified number of directors) without (in
addition to any other vote required by law, this Restated Certificate of
Incorporation or the By-Laws of the Corporation) obtaining the written
consent, waiver or affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors
(or such specified number of directors), given in writing or by vote at a

 



      
 

 



 

meeting, and any such act or transaction entered into without such consent,
waiver or vote shall be null and void _ab initio_ , and of no force or effect.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for so long as the
Stockholders Agreement remains in effect, in the event that any provision
herein has a corresponding provision in, or otherwise relates or is applicable
to, the Stockholders Agreement, such provision herein shall be interpreted in
a manner consistent with, and giving full effect to, the provisions of the
Stockholders Agreement. A copy of the Stockholders Agreement will be provided
to any stockholder of the Corporation upon request.

 



 

ARTICLE XI 
STOCKHOLDER ACTION

 



 

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation may be taken only at a duly called annual or special meeting of
the stockholders, and not by written consent in lieu of such a meeting, and
special meetings of stockholders may be called only by a majority of the Whole
Board or (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect) a
majority of the Independent Directors.

 



 

ARTICLE XII 
EXCLUSIVE FORUM

 



 

Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director,
officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation
or the Corporations stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising
pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or as to which the DGCL confers
jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any
action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Restated

 **AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS**

 



 

 **Article I - General.**

 



 

1.1 **_Offices_**. The registered office of Sonus Networks, Inc. (the "
_Company_ ") shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State
of Delaware. The Company may also have offices at such other places both
within and without the State of Delaware as the Board of Directors may from
time to time determine or the business of the Company may require.

 



 

1.2 **_Seal_**. The seal, if any, of the Company shall be in the form of a
circle and shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Company, the year of
its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware."

 



 

1.3 **_Fiscal Year_**. The fiscal year of the Company shall be the period from
January 1 through December 31.

 



 

 **Article II - Stockholders.**

 



 

2.1 **_Place of Meetings_**. Each meeting of the stockholders shall be held
upon notice as hereinafter provided, at such place, if any, as the Board of
Directors shall have determined and as shall be stated in such notice.

 



 

2.2 **_Annual Meeting_**. The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held
each year on such date and at such time as the Board of Directors may
determine. At each annual meeting the stockholders entitled to vote shall
elect such members of the Board of Directors as are standing for election, by
ballot, and they may transact such other corporate business as may properly be
brought before the meeting.

 



 

2.3 **_Quorum_**. At all meetings of the stockholders the holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum requisite for the transaction of business except as
otherwise provided by law, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation (the
"Certificate of Incorporation"), or these by-laws. Whether or not there is
such a quorum at any meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the stockholders
entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, by a majority vote,
may adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice of such adjourned
meeting if the time and place, if any, thereof, are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken. If the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At such adjourned
meeting, at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted
that might have been transacted if the meeting had been held as originally
called. The stockholders present in person or by proxy at a duly called
meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave
less than a quorum.

 



 

2.4 **_Right to Vote; Proxies_**. Subject to the provisions of the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation, each holder of a share or shares of capital
stock of the Company having the right to vote at any meeting shall be entitled
to one vote for each such share of stock held by him. Any stockholder entitled
to vote at any meeting of stockholders may vote either in person or by proxy,
but no proxy that is dated more than three years prior to the meeting at which
it is offered shall confer the right to vote thereat unless the proxy provides
that it shall be effective for a longer period. A proxy may be granted by a

 



      
 

 



 

writing executed by the stockholder or his authorized agent or by transmission
or authorization of transmission of a telegram, cablegram, or other means of
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or like
agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to
receive such transmission, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 212
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as it may be amended
from time to time (the " _General Corporation Law_ "). A proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power.

 



 

2.5 **_Voting_**.

 



 

(a) At all meetings of stockholders, when a quorum is present, in all matters
other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority in voting power of the shares of stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on such matter shall
be the act of the stockholders unless a different or minimum vote is required
by the Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws, the rules or regulations
of any stock exchange applicable to the Company, or any law or regulation
applicable to the Company or its securities, in which case such different or
minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter.

 



 

(b) At all meetings of stockholders at which directors are to be elected,
other than in a Contested Election Meeting (as defined below), when a quorum
is present, a nominee for election as a director at such meeting shall be
elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast "for" such nominees
election exceed the votes cast "against" such nominees election (with
"abstentions" and "broker non-votes" not counted as a vote "for" or "against"
such nominees election). In a Contested Election Meeting, when a quorum is
present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy at such Contested Election Meeting
and entitled to vote on the election of directors. If directors are to be
elected by a plurality vote, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote
against a nominee. A meeting of stockholders shall be a " _Contested Election
Meeting_ " if the number of nominees for election as directors exceeds the
number of directors to be elected at such meeting, as of the tenth (10th) day
preceding the date of the Companys first notice to stockholders of such
meeting sent pursuant to Section 2.6 or Section 2.9, as applicable, of these
by-laws (the " _Determination Date_ "); provided, however, that if, in
accordance with Section 2.12 of these by-laws, stockholders are entitled to
nominate persons for election as a director after the otherwise applicable
Determination Date, the Determination Date shall instead be the last day on
which stockholders are entitled to nominate persons for election as a director
in accordance with Section 2.12.

 



 

2.6 **_Notice of Annual Meetings_**. Unless otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, notice of the date, time, place
(if any), and the means of remote communications (if any), by which
stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote,
of each annual meeting of the stockholders shall be given, at least ten (10)
days but not more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote. Such notice shall be given personally
or by mail or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, by
a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Notices are deemed given as provided in Section 6.2(a) of
these by-laws. The Board of Directors may postpone, reschedule or cancel any
annual meeting of the stockholders at its discretion, even after notice
thereof has been given. Notice need not be given to any stockholder who
submits a written waiver of notice signed by him or waives notice by
electronic transmission, whether before or after the time of such meeting.
Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder attends the
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called
or

 



      
 

 



 

convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any
annual meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any waiver of notice.

 



 

2.7 **_Stockholders  List_**. A complete list of the stockholders entitled to
vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order and
showing the address of each stockholder, and the number of shares registered
in the name of each stockholder, shall be prepared by the Company at least ten
(10) days before every meeting of stockholders. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, at
least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to
such list is provided with the notice of meeting, or (ii) during ordinary
business hours, at the principal place of business of the Company. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held
solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonable accessible electronic network.

 



 

2.8 **_Special Meetings_**. Special meetings of the stockholders for any
purpose or purposes, unless otherwise provided by law, may be called only by a
majority of the Whole Board (as defined below) or (for so long as the
Principal Stockholders Agreement, dated [*], 2017, by and among the Company,
Heritage PE (OEP) II, L.P., Heritage PE (OEP) III, L.P. and certain other
stockholder parties thereto as such agreement may be amended from time to time
(the " _Stockholders Agreement_ ") remains in effect) a majority of the
Independent Directors (as such term is defined in the Stockholders Agreement,
the " _Independent Directors_ "). The Board of Directors may postpone,
reschedule or cancel any special meeting of the stockholders at its
discretion, even after notice thereof has been given.

 



 

2.9 **_Notice of Special Meetings_**. Unless otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, notice of the date, time, place
(if any), the means of remote communications (if any), by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote, and the
purpose or purposes of each special meeting of the stockholders shall be
given, at least ten (10) days but not more than sixty (60) days prior to the
meeting, to each stockholder of record entitled to vote. Such notice shall be
given personally or by mail or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by
applicable law, by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the
stockholder to whom the notice is given. Notices are deemed given as provided
in Section 6.2(a) of these by-laws. No business may be transacted at such
meeting except that referred to in said notice, or in a supplemental notice
given also in compliance with the provisions hereof, or such other business as
may be germane or supplementary to that stated in said notice or notices as
determined by the Board of Directors. Notice need not be given to any
stockholder who submits a written waiver of notice signed by him or waives
notice by electronic transmission, whether before or after the time of such
meeting. Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting of stockholders shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the stockholder
attends the meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of
the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any
waiver of notice.

 



 

2.10 **_Inspectors_**. The Company shall, in advance of any meeting of
stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make a
written report thereof. Such inspectors shall have the powers and duties set
forth in Section 231 of the General Corporation Law as currently in effect or
as the same may hereafter be amended. Each inspector, before discharging his
or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of
inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of such
inspectors ability. At the meeting for which the inspector or inspectors are
appointed, he or they shall, in addition to the duties set forth in Section
231 of the General Corporation Law, receive and take charge of the proxies and
ballots, and decide all questions touching on the qualifications of voters,
the

 



      
 

 



 

validity of proxies, and the acceptance and rejection of votes. If any
inspector previously appointed shall fail to attend or refuse or be unable to
act at a meeting of stockholders, the presiding officer shall appoint an
inspector to act at the meeting.

 



 

2.11 **_Stockholders  Consent in Lieu of Meeting_**. Unless otherwise
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, any action required to
be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company, or
any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
stockholders, may be taken only at such a meeting, and not by written consent
of stockholders.

 



 

2.12 **_Notice of Stockholder Business and Nominations_**.

 



 

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. (1) Nominations of persons for election
to the Board of Directors of the Company and the proposal of other business to
be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of
stockholders only (A) pursuant to the Companys notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto), (B) subject to the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as
the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect), by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, or (C) subject to the
Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement remains in
effect), by any stockholder of the Company who was a stockholder of record of
the Company at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.12 is
delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the
meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section
2.12.

 



 

(2) For any nominations or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(1) of
this Section 2.12, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in
writing to the Secretary of the Company and any such proposed business (other
than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors) must
constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a
stockholders notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the
ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one
hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
years annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that no annual
meeting was held in the prior year or the date of the annual meeting is more
than thirty (30) days before or more than seventy (70) days after such
anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier
than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to
such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is
first made by the Company). For purposes of the first annual meeting following
the adoption of these By-Laws, the date of the first anniversary of the
preceding years annual meeting shall be deemed to be June 9, 2018. In no
event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an
annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Such stockholders notice
shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to
nominate for election as a director (i) all information relating to such
person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for
election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in
each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") and (ii)
such persons written consent to being named in the Companys proxy statement
as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (B) as to any other
business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text
of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed
for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to
amend the by-laws of the Company, the language of the proposed amendment), the
reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest
in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on
whose behalf the proposal is made; and

 



      
 

 



 

(C) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any,
on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of
such stockholder, as they appear on the Companys books, and of such
beneficial owner, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital
stock of the Company which are owned beneficially and of record by such
stockholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a description of any agreement,
arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal
between or among such stockholder and such beneficial owner, any of their
respective affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with any
of the foregoing, (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests,
options, warrants, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions,
and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of
the stockholders notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder and such
beneficial owners, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to,
manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the
voting power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner, with respect to
shares of stock of the Company, (v) a representation that the stockholder is a
holder of record of stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting and
intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such
business or nomination, and (vi) a representation whether the stockholder or
the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a)
to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the
percentage of the Companys outstanding capital stock required to approve or
adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit
proxies or votes from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination.
The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.12 shall be deemed
satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than a nomination if
the stockholder has notified the Company of his, her or its intention to
present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules
and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholders
proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the
Company to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The Company may require
any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably
require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a
director of the Company.

 



 

(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(2) of
this Section 2.12 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors
to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Company is increased effective
at the annual meeting and there is no public announcement by the Company
naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred
(100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual
meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 2.12 shall also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional
directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the
tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public announcement is first
made by the Company.

 



 

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the Companys notice of meeting. Nominations of persons
for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Companys
notice of meeting (1) subject to the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as
the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect), by or at the direction of the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, or (2) provided that the Board of
Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting and
subject to the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders
Agreement remains in effect), by any stockholder of the Company who is a
stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 2.12
is delivered to the Secretary of the Company, who is entitled to vote at the
meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set
forth in this Section 2.12. In the event the Company calls a special meeting
of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board
of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of
directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election
to such position(s) as specified in the Companys

 



      
 

 



 

notice of meeting, if the stockholders notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of
this Section 2.12 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Company not earlier than the close of business on the
one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such special meeting and not later
than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to
such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
announcement is first made by the Company of the date of the special meeting
and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such
meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any
time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

 



 

(c) _General_. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.12 shall be eligible to be elected at
an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company to serve as
directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (A) to
determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before
the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.12 (including whether the stockholder
or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is
made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit,
as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of such stockholders nominee
or proposal in compliance with such stockholders representation as required
by clause (a)(2)(C)(vi) of this Section 2.12) and (B) if any proposed
nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this
Section 2.12, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that
such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.12, unless otherwise required by law, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear
at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company to present a
nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such vote may have been received by the Company. For purposes of
this Section 2.12, to be considered a qualified representative of the
stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of
such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such
stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act
for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person
must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of
stockholders.

 



 

(2) For purposes of this Section 2.12, "public announcement" shall include
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or other national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 2.12; provided however, that any references in these by-
laws to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated thereunder are not intended
to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or proposals
as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section 2.12
(including paragraphs (a)(1)(C) and (b) hereof), and compliance with
paragraphs (a)(1)(C) and (b) of this Section 2.12 shall be the exclusive means
for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business (other than, as
provided in the penultimate sentence of (a)(2), matters brought properly under
and in compliance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, as may be amended from
time to time). Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall be deemed to affect any
rights (A) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Companys
proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (B) of the holders of any series

 



      
 

 



 

of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of
the Companys Certificate of Incorporation.

 



 

2.13 **_Conduct of Meetings_**. The date and time of the opening and the
closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at
a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the
meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and
regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem
appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations
as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of
stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene, to recess and to
adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and
to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or
procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the
presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the
following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the
meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Company, their
duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding
person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the
meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations
on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding
person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other
determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall,
if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or
business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding
person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the
meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting,
meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with
the rules of parliamentary procedure.

 



 

 **Article III - Directors.**

 



 

3.1 **_Number of Directors_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation, or these by-laws, the property and business of the Company
shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors. Directors
need not be stockholders, residents of Delaware, or citizens of the United
States. The use of the phrase " _Whole Board_ " herein refers to the total
number of directors which the Company would have if there were no vacancies or
unfilled newly-created directorships.

 



 

(b) The number of directors constituting the full Board of Directors shall be
as determined from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the
Whole Board in a manner consistent (for so long as it remains in effect) with
the Stockholders Agreement. Each director shall be elected annually at each
annual meeting of the Companys stockholders. Members of the Board of
Directors shall hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders at which
their respective successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier
death, incapacity, resignation, or removal.

 



 

(c) Except as the General Corporation Law, the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders
Agreement is in effect) may otherwise require, newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any
vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, incapacity,
disqualification, resignation, or removal from office or other cause may only
be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors
then in office, although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining
director.

 



      
 

 



 

Any director so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election of the
directors and until such directors successor shall be elected and qualified.
No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

 



 

3.2 **_Resignation_**. Any director of the Company may resign at any time by
giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Chairman of the
Board, the President, or the Secretary of the Company. Such resignation shall
take effect at the time specified therein, at the time of receipt if no time
is specified therein and at the time of acceptance if the effectiveness of
such resignation is conditioned upon its acceptance. Unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary
to make it effective.

Corporation Law, the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or the
Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement is in
effect), any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed from
office at any time, (a) for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the voting power of the shares of the Companys stock entitled to
vote for the election of directors, voting together as a single class, or (b)
without cause by (i) subject to clause (ii), the affirmative vote of the

stock entitled to vote for the election of directors, voting together as a
single class or (ii) in the event recommended by at least two-thirds of the

of directors, voting together as a single class.

required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



 

3.6 **_Committees_**. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors of the Company.
Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors or in these by-laws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and
authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and
affairs of the Company to the extent permitted by law, and may authorize the
seal of the Company to be affixed to all papers which may require it. Such
committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined
from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.

 



 

3.7 **_Powers Denied to Committees_**. Committees of the Board of Directors
shall not, in any event, have the power or authority to: (i) approve or adopt,

Corporation Law to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (ii) adopt,
amend or repeal any by-law of the Company.

 



 

3.8 **_Substitute Committee Member_**. Subject to the restrictions set forth
in the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement is in

alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified

in the Stockholders Agreement (for so long as the Stockholders Agreement is in
effect), in the absence or disqualification of a

 



      
 

 



 

member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting
and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members
constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of
Directors to act at the meeting in the place of such absent or disqualified
member. Any committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and report
the same to the Board of Directors as may be required by the Board of
Directors.

 



 

3.9 **_Compensation of Directors_**. The Board of Directors shall have the
power to fix the compensation of directors and members of committees of the
Board. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attendance at each
meeting of the Board of Directors, may be paid a fixed sum for attendance at
each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated salary as director and may
receive stock options, grants and issuances of restricted stock under the
Companys equity incentive plan(s). No such payment shall preclude any
director from serving the Company in any other capacity and receiving
compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be
allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.

given by the person or persons calling the meeting at least forty-eight hours
before the special meeting to each director, personally or by telephone,

in the manner permitted by applicable law. Notice need not be given to any
director who submits a written waiver of notice signed by him or waives notice
by electronic transmission, whether before or after the time of such meeting.
Attendance of any director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when such director attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any special meeting of
the directors need be specified in any waiver of notice.

 



 

3.12 **_Quorum_**. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of
the Whole Board shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors
present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the
Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically permitted or
provided by law, or by the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, or by these
by-laws. If at any meeting of the board there shall be less than a quorum
present, a majority of those directors present may adjourn the meeting from
time to time until a quorum is obtained, and no further notice of the
adjourned meeting need be given if the time and place, if any, thereof, are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.

 



 

3.13 **_Telephonic Participation in Meetings_**. Members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may
participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference telephone or other
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this
by-law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

 



 

3.14 **_Action by Consent_**. Unless otherwise restricted by the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation or these by-laws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any
committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board
of Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing
or by electronic transmission

 



      
 

 



 

and the writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the
minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee in accordance

time, authorize any officer to appoint and remove subordinate officers and to

 **Article V - Stock.**

 



 

5.1 **_Stock_**. The shares of the Company shall be represented by
certificates, provided that the Board of Directors may provide by resolution
or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock
shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the
Company. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled

authorized officers of the Company, including, but not limited to, the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, a Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors,
the President, a Vice-President, the Treasurer, an Assistant Treasurer, the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary representing the number or shares
registered in

 



      
 

 



 

certificate form and shall be sealed with the corporate seal of the Company.
The certificates of stock of the Company shall be numbered and shall be
entered in the books of the Company as they are issued. Any or all the
signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer or
officers, transfer agent or registrar who shall have signed, or whose
facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on, any such
certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers,
transfer agent or registrar of the Company, whether because of death,
resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have
been issued, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued by
the Company with the same effect as though the person or persons who signed
such certificate or certificates or whose facsimile signature shall have been
used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers, transfer agent or
registrar of the Company.

 



 

5.2 **_Fractional Share Interests_**. The Company may, but shall not be
required to, issue fractions of a share. If the Company does not issue
fractions of a share, it shall (i) arrange for the disposition of fractional
interests by those entitled thereto, (ii) pay in cash the fair value of
fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such
fractions are determined, or (iii) issue scrip or warrants in registered form
(either represented by a certificate or uncertificated) or in bearer form
(represented by a certificate) that shall entitle the holder to receive a full
share upon the surrender of such scrip or warrants aggregating a full share. A
certificate for a fractional share or an uncertificated fractional share
shall, but scrip or warrants shall not unless otherwise provided therein,
entitle the holder to exercise voting rights, to receive dividends thereon,
and to participate in any of the assets of the Company in the event of
liquidation. The Board of Directors may cause scrip or warrants to be issued
subject to the conditions that they shall become void if not exchanged for
certificates representing full shares or uncertificated full shares before a
specified date, or subject to the conditions that the shares for which scrip
or warrants are exchangeable may be sold by the Company and the proceeds
thereof distributed to the holders of scrip or warrants, or subject to any
other conditions that the Board of Directors may impose.

 



 

5.3 **_Transfers of Stock_**. Subject to any transfer restrictions then in
force, the shares of stock of the Company shall be transferable only upon its
books by the holders thereof in person or by their duly authorized attorneys
or legal representatives, and upon the surrender of the certificate or
certificates for such shares properly endorsed (or, with respect to
uncertificated shares, by delivery of duly executed instructions or in any
other manner permitted by applicable law). The Company shall be entitled to
treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in
fact thereof and accordingly shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or
other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof save as expressly
provided by the laws of Delaware.

 



 

5.4 **_Record Date_**. For the purpose of determining the stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or the allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion, or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in
advance, a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty
(60) days prior to any other action. If no such record date is fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held; and the record date for determining stockholders
for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which
the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination
of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the

 



       
 

 



 

meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record
date for the adjourned meeting.

 



 

5.5 **_Transfer Agent and Registrar_**. The Board of Directors may appoint one
or more transfer agents or transfer clerks and one or more registrars and may
require all certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any
of them.

 



 

5.6 **_Dividends_**.

 



 

(a) **_Power to Declare_**. Dividends upon the capital stock of the Company,
subject to the provisions of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, if
any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special
meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in
shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation and the General Corporation Law.

 



 

(b) **_Reserves_**. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out
of any funds of the Company lawfully available for dividends such sum or sums
as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper
as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends,
or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Company, or for such other
purpose as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the Company,
and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in
which it was created.

 



 

5.7 **_Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_**. No certificates for shares
of stock of the Company (or uncertificated shares, as the case may be) shall
be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen, or
destroyed, except upon production of such evidence of the loss, theft, or
destruction and upon indemnification of the Company and its agents to such
extent and in such manner as the Board of Directors may from time to time
prescribe.

 



 

5.8 **_Inspection of Books_**. Any stockholder, in person or by attorney or
other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose
thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any
proper purpose the Companys stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its
other books and records; and no stockholder shall have any right to inspect
any account or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law.

 



 

 **Article VI - Miscellaneous Management Provisions.**

 



 

6.1 **_Checks, Drafts, and Notes_**. All checks, drafts, or orders for the
payment of money, and all notes and acceptances of the Company shall be signed
by such officer or officers, or such agent or agents, as the Board of
Directors may designate.

 



 

6.2 **_Notices_**.

 



 

(a) Notices to directors may be given personally or by telephone, mail,
facsimile, electronic mail or other electronic transmission to the extent and
in the manner permitted by applicable law. Notices to stockholders may be
given personally or by mail or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by
applicable law, by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the
stockholder to whom the notice is given. In accordance with Section 232 of the
General Corporation Law, notices are deemed given (i) if by mail, when
deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at such stockholders address as it appears on the records of the
Company, or, if a stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the
Company a written request that notices to such stockholder be mailed to some
other address, then directed to such stockholder at such other address; (ii)
if by facsimile,

 



      
 

 



 

when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive
notice; (iii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail
address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice; (iv) if
by posting on an electronic network together with a separate notice to the
stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (A) such
posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice of such posting; and (v) if
by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder
in the manner consented to by the stockholder. Notice shall be deemed to have
been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is
given in accordance with Section 233 of the General Corporation Law. An
affidavit of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary or any transfer agent of the
Company that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

 



 

(b) Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of any
applicable law or of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or of these
by-laws, a written waiver of notice, signed by the person or persons entitled
to said notice, or a waiver of notice by electronic transmission, whether
before or after the time stated therein or the meeting or action to which such
notice relates, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person
at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting except when
the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

 



 

6.3 **_Conflict of Interest_**. No contract or transaction between the Company
and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the Company and any
other corporation, partnership, association, or other organization in which
one or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers, or have a
financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or
solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the
meeting of the board or committee thereof that authorized the contract or
transaction, or solely because any such directors or officers votes are
counted for such purpose, if: (i) the material facts as to the directors or
officers relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are
disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the
Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum; or
(ii) the material facts as to the directors or officers relationship or
interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or
transaction as specifically approved in good faith by vote of such
stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the Company
as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified, by the Board of
Directors, a committee or the stockholders. Common or interested directors may
be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board
of Directors or of a committee that authorizes the contract or transaction.

 



 

6.4 **_Voting of Securities Owned by the Company_**. Subject always to the
specific directions of the Board of Directors, (i) any shares or other
securities issued by any other entity and owned or controlled by the Company
may be voted in person at any meeting of security holders of such other entity
by the President of the Company if he is present at such meeting, or in his
absence by the Treasurer of the Company if he is present at such meeting, and
(ii) whenever, in the judgment of the President, it is desirable for the
Company to execute a proxy or written consent in respect to any shares or
other securities issued by any other entity and owned by the Company, such
proxy or consent shall be executed in the name of the Company by the
President, without the necessity of any authorization by the Board of
Directors, affixation of corporate seal or countersignature or attestation by
another officer, provided that if the President is unable to execute such
proxy or consent by reason of sickness, absence from the United States or
other similar cause, the Treasurer may execute such proxy or consent. Any
person or persons designated in the manner above stated as the proxy or
proxies of the Company shall have full right, power

 



      
 

 



 

and authority to vote the shares or other securities issued by such other
entity and owned by the Company the same as such shares or other securities
might be voted by the Company.

 



 

 **Article VII - Indemnification.**

 



 

7.1 **_Right to Indemnification_**. Each person who was or is made a party or
is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of being or having been a director or officer
of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company, serving or
having served at the request of the Company as a director, trustee, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (an " _Indemnitee_ "), shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Company to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties
and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as
to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, employee,
or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees heirs, executors,
and administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 7.2
hereof with respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or
Advancement of Expenses, the Company shall indemnify any such Indemnitee in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company. The right to indemnification conferred in this
Article 7 shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by
the Company the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending any
such Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an " _Advancement of
Expenses_ "); provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such
Advancement of Expenses shall be made only upon the Companys receipt of an
undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a " _Final
Adjudication_ ") that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses under this Article 7 or otherwise.

 



 

7.2 **_Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_**. If a claim under Section 7.1
hereof is not paid in full by the Company within sixty days after a written
claim has been received by the Company, except in the case of a claim for an
Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty
days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part
in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Company to recover an
Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or
defending such suit to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. In (i)
any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification
hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to
an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit
by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of
an Undertaking the Company shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a
Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 145 of the General Corporation Law. Neither the
failure of the Company (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in
the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in Section 145 of the General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the Company (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit
brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by
the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an Advancement of
Expenses

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder, or by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, under this
Article 7 or otherwise shall be on the Company.

 



 

7.3 **_Non-Exclusivity of Rights_**. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article 7 shall not be exclusive of
any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under any law,
the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, these by-laws, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

7.4 **_Insurance_**. The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
