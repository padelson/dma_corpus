Liabilities under Section 2.3(c);

(h) Any liability, obligation or commitment of Seller or any Selling

employee or former employee of the Business (including as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement);

(i) Any and all obligations, liabilities or commitments (whether or not
arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement) of Seller, any of the Selling Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates (i) under Title IV of ERISA including with respect to
any multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (ii) otherwise
relating to any employee benefit or compensation plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement of any type or (iii) relating to the employment or

party arrangement;

(j) Any Indebtedness or Seller Expenses;

(k) Any liability, obligation or commitment that relates to, or that arises
out of (i) any suit, action or proceeding pending or, to Seller's Knowledge,
threatened as of the Closing Date or (ii) any violation by Seller or any of
its Affiliates of any Law or Contract, in each case of clause (i) and (ii), to
the extent relating to the period of time prior to the Closing;

Subsidiary to the extent that it exclusively relates to, or arises out of, any
Excluded Asset.

Section 2.5. Purchase Price.

(a) The consideration for Buyer's purchase of the Purchased Assets (the
"Purchase Price") shall be (i) an amount in cash equal to the sum of $420
million (the "Base Closing Cash Payment"), plus (A) the Estimated Adjustment
Surplus Amount, if any, minus (B) the Estimated 

Adjustment Deficiency Amount, if any (such amount as calculated in this clause
is referred to herein as the "Closing Cash Payment"), and (ii) Buyer's
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

(b) At Closing, Buyer shall pay the Closing Cash Payment to Seller and/or its
designated Affiliates by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by Seller in writing.

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall assume the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 2.6. Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Estimated Inventory.

(i) Seller shall, at least three (3) but no more than five (5) Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date, cause to be prepared and delivered to
Buyer a statement setting forth Seller's good faith estimate of the Closing
Inventory Amount (the "Estimated Closing Inventory Amount") and the components
thereof, prepared in a manner and on a basis consistent with the Accounting
Principles. Prior to delivery of the statement setting forth the Estimated
Closing Inventory Amount, Seller shall conduct a physical inventory of the
inventory of the Business (and Buyer shall have the right to be present at,
and to observe, such physical inventory), and such statement shall be based on
such physical inventory.

(ii) To the extent that the Estimated Closing Inventory Amount is greater than
the Target, such excess amount shall be the "Estimated Adjustment Surplus
Amount." If the Estimated Closing Inventory Amount is less than the Target,
the difference shall be the "Estimated Adjustment Deficiency Amount." For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Estimated Closing Inventory Amount is equal to the
Target, then each of the Estimated Adjustment Surplus Amount and the Estimated
Adjustment Deficiency Amount shall be zero Dollars ($0).

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to Seller a statement (the "Inventory Statement")
setting forth the Closing Inventory Amount and the components thereof. The
Inventory Statement shall be prepared and calculated in good faith, and in the
manner and on a basis consistent with the Accounting Principles (if
applicable).

(c) After receipt of the Inventory Statement, Seller will have sixty (60) days
to review the Inventory Statement. Unless Seller delivers written notice
(which notice shall include the items and amounts in dispute and supporting
documentation related thereto) to Buyer setting forth the items disputed by
Seller with respect thereto on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day after
Seller's receipt of the Inventory Statement, Seller will be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Inventory Statement and such statement (and the
calculations contained therein) will be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties. If Seller notifies Buyer of its objections to items contained in the
Inventory Statement (or calculations contained therein) within such 60-day
period, Seller and Buyer shall, during the sixty (60) days following delivery
of such notice by 

Seller to Buyer (or such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing)
(the "Resolution Period"), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences
with respect to the disputed items (or calculations) included in such notice
(the "Disputed Items"), and all other items (and all calculations relating
thereto) will be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, provided that
any such discussions shall be protected by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence (and state analogs) and shall not be presented to the Neutral
Arbitrator. Any resolution by Seller and Buyer during the Resolution Period as
to any Disputed Item shall be set forth in writing and will be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties.

(d) If Buyer and Seller do not resolve all Disputed Items by the end of the
Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining in dispute will be
submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator, and either party may submit such Disputed
Items in the first instance. The Neutral Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator
to determine only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute, consistent with
this Section 2.6, and shall request a statement from Buyer and Seller
regarding such Disputed Items. The scope of the disputes to be arbitrated by
the Neutral Arbitrator is limited to those items or calculations specifically
in dispute between Buyer and Seller; and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Neutral Arbitrator is not to make any other
determination, including not making any determination as to whether any non-
disputed portion of the Inventory Statement was prepared in accordance with
the Accounting Principles or whether the agreed upon dollar amount of the
Target is correct or appropriate. In resolving each Disputed Item, the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be bound by the principles set forth in this Section 2.6 and
may not assign a value to any Disputed Item greater than the greatest value
for such Disputed Item claimed by any party or less than the lowest value for
such Disputed Item claimed by any party. All fees and expenses relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator will be allocated
between Buyer and Seller in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of
the Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the
Neutral Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such Disputed Items so
submitted. The Neutral Arbitrator will deliver to Buyer and Seller a written
determination (such determination to include a work sheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based
solely on information provided to the Neutral Arbitrator by Seller and Buyer
and this Section 2.6 and the definitions referenced herein) of the Disputed
Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within thirty (30) days of receipt
of such Disputed Items, which determination will be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties. The final, binding and conclusive Inventory
Statement based either upon agreement by the parties, or deemed agreement by
Buyer and Seller in accordance with this Section 2.6, or the written
determination delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this
Section 2.6(d) will be the "Conclusive Inventory Statement." If any party
fails to submit a statement regarding any Disputed Item submitted to the
Neutral Arbitrator within the time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator or
otherwise fails to give the Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested,
then the Neutral Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the
evidence timely submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by
the other party. 

(e) Subject to Section 2.6(f):

(i) The amount by which the Closing Cash Payment is greater than the Final
Payment Amount, if any, shall be paid by Seller to Buyer by wire transfer of
immediately available funds; and

(ii) The amount by which the Closing Cash Payment is less than the Final
Payment Amount, if any, shall be paid by Buyer to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (the amount, if any, payable to Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.6(e)(i) and the amount, if any, payable to Seller pursuant to this
clause (ii) are referred to herein as the "Adjustment Amount").

Any amount payable to any party pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. For purposes of this Section 2.6:

(A) the "Final Payment Amount" shall be an amount in Dollars equal to (i) the
Base Closing Cash Payment plus (ii) the Final Adjustment Surplus Amount, if
any, or minus (iii) the Final Adjustment Deficiency Amount, if any;

(B) the "Final Adjustment Surplus Amount" shall be the amount, if any, by
which the Final Inventory Amount is greater than the Target;

(C) the "Final Adjustment Deficiency Amount" shall be the amount, if any, by
which the Final Inventory Amount is less than the Target;

(D) the "Final Inventory Amount " shall be the Closing Inventory Amount as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.6.

(f) If, after receipt of the Inventory Statement pursuant to Section 2.6(b):

(i) Seller does not deliver a dispute notice as described in Section 2.6(c)
within the 60-day period following Seller's receipt of the Inventory Statement
or if within such period Seller delivers a notice to Buyer stating that Seller
does not dispute any item in the Inventory Statement (such notice, a "Non-
Dispute Notice"), then on the second Business Day following the earlier of the
last day of such 60-day period or the date on which Buyer receives such Non-
Dispute Notice, as applicable, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall make the
payment of the Adjustment Amount as provided in Section 2.6(e); or

(ii) Within two (2) Business Days after resolution or deemed resolution of all
Disputed Items in accordance with Section 2.6 (whether by mutual agreement
between Buyer and Seller, or by decision of the Neutral Arbitrator), Buyer or
Seller, as applicable shall make the payment of the Adjustment Amount as
provided in Section 2.6(e).

After the Closing and until the Final Inventory Amount has been determined to
be final in accordance with this Section 2.6 between the parties or the
determination of the Final Inventory Amount has been submitted to the Neutral
Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2.6(c), each of Buyer 

and Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, assist the other
party and its Representatives in (as applicable) the preparation of the
Inventory Statement pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and the delivery of Seller's
notice pursuant to Section 2.6(c), and in connection therewith shall provide
to such other party and its Representatives reasonable access to the Books and
Records and to any other information they reasonably request, including work
papers of their respective accountants, and to any employees and premises
during regular business hours, and any failure to provide such access within
five (5) Business Days of such a request shall result in the applicable time
period for delivery by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, to be extended for each
additional day required to satisfy such request.

Section 2.7. Closing; Delivery and Payment.

(a) Closing Date. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Dechert LLP, Cira
Center, 2929 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, commencing at 10:00 a.m.
(Philadelphia time), on the second (2nd) Business Day following the date on
which all the conditions to Closing in Article VII are satisfied or waived, or
on such other date or at such other time as may be mutually agreed upon in
writing by Buyer and Seller (the date on which the Closing occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held by
the remote exchange of documents and/or funds unless another method or place
is mutually agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller.

(b) Delivery by Seller. At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Buyer the following:

(i) the Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Seller or its Affiliates, as
applicable;

(ii) the certificate required pursuant to Section 7.2(d);

(iii) written evidence, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to
Buyer, of the termination of the Contracts, if any, set forth on Schedule
2.7(b)(iii); and

(iv) a certificate of non-foreign status with respect to Seller and each
Selling Subsidiary that is a "United States person" within the meaning of
Section 7701 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations, dated as of the
Closing Date and in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer conforming to the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2).

(c) Delivery by Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Seller the following:

(i) the Closing Cash Payment, in accordance with Section 2.5(b);

(ii) the Ancillary Agreements, duly executed by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, as the case may be; and

(iii) the certificate required pursuant to Section 7.3(c). 

(d) Risk of Loss Pre-Closing. The parties acknowledge that prior to the
Closing, Buyer does not own the Purchased Assets, and therefore any loss or
damage to the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing from fire, casualty or any
other similar circumstance or occurrence shall be the sole responsibility of
the Seller Parties

(e) Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the case of any of the transactions described in Section 2.1,
for accounting purposes the Closing shall be deemed to occur on the Closing
Date at 12:01 a.m. (New York time).

Section 2.8. Nonassignability.

(a) Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure all
consents, approvals and waivers reasonably necessary to transfer to Buyer on
the Closing Date each of the Purchased Assets free and clear of any Lien (the
"Consents"); provided, however, that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
required to pay any consideration or compromise any rights not otherwise
required by this Agreement to be compromised for any such Consent; provided
further that certain contracts set forth on Schedule 2.8 shall be addressed as
required by Schedule 2.8. All such Consents shall be in writing in accordance
with the underlying Contracts and copies thereof shall be delivered to Buyer
promptly after receipt thereof by Seller. Seller shall not agree to any
modification of any Purchased Assets in the course of obtaining any Consent
where such modification would affect in a materially negative manner such
Purchased Assets or the Business. To the extent any Consent has not been
obtained on or prior to the Closing Date and such Consent is not a subject of
a closing condition, the Closing shall proceed (to the extent this Agreement
otherwise contemplates that the Closing shall proceed) and Buyer shall pay the
full Closing Cash Payment at Closing, but the related Purchased Assets (a
"Delayed Asset") shall not be transferred hereunder to Buyer and any related
liability that constitutes an Assumed Liability (a "Delayed Liability") shall
not be assumed hereunder by Buyer (other than to the extent expressly provided
in this Section 2.8) unless and until such Consent has been obtained.

(b) In the event that the Closing is consummated and there are any Delayed
Assets, the parties shall cooperate to enter into such lawful arrangements
reasonably proposed by Buyer to provide Buyer with the benefits intended to be
assigned in respect of such Delayed Asset and, to the extent that Buyer is
provided with such benefits, Buyer shall assume, pay when due and perform any
corresponding Delayed Liabilities as and when obligated. Seller shall take
such action as Buyer may reasonably request so as (i) to provide Buyer with
the benefits of each Delayed Asset (including permitting Buyer to take
actions, in the name of Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, required to
enforce any rights reasonably necessary for Buyer to receive the full benefits
of such Delayed Asset) and (ii) to effect collection of money or other
consideration due and payable under the Delayed Asset. Seller shall promptly
pay over to Buyer all money or other consideration received by it in respect
of each Delayed Asset. With respect to each Delayed Asset, as of and from the
Closing Date, Seller hereby authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the terms of the Delayed Asset, to perform all the
obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller under the Delayed Asset.

(c) In the event that the Closing proceeds and there are any Delayed Assets,
then following the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to 

obtain as promptly as reasonably practical such Consents. At such time and on
each occasion after the Closing Date that a Consent is obtained with respect
to each Delayed Asset, Seller or the Selling Subsidiary, as the case may be,
shall assign, lease, sublease, transfer, convey or deliver such Delayed Asset
forthwith to Buyer, and Buyer shall assume the corresponding Delayed
Liabilities. Prior to any such transfer of Delayed Assets, Seller shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and maintain such Delayed
Assets in all material respects pursuant to the terms thereof.

Section 2.9. Withholding. Buyer will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts payable pursuant to or as contemplated by this Agreement any Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law; provided Buyer
shall provide notice of its intent to deduct and withhold at least two (2)
days prior to the anticipated Closing Date. To the extent that any such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.10. Retained Technology License. At the Closing, Seller will execute
and deliver a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license agreement (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D) to Buyer with
respect to any Trade Secrets owned or controlled by Seller or any of the
Selling Subsidiaries that are actually used in connection with and reasonably
necessary for the operation or conduct of the Business on the Closing Date and
that are not included in the Transferred Technology (the "Retained Technology
License").

Subject to Section 10.8, Seller and each Selling Subsidiary hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to Buyer as follows:

Section 3.1. Organization and Qualification. Seller and each Selling
Subsidiary is either duly organized or incorporated (as applicable), and is
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such a concept exists
under its jurisdiction of organization) under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Seller and each Selling Subsidiary has all requisite corporate
(or similar entity) power and authority to own and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business, including the Business (as applicable),
as currently conducted. Seller is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
properties and assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for failures to be so qualified or in good standing that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Business or the Purchased Assets or materially impede Seller's
ability to execute, deliver or perform this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, or to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Each Selling Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its
properties and assets or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except for failures to be so qualified or in good standing that

material to the Business or the 

Purchased Assets or materially impede each Selling Subsidiary's ability to
execute, deliver or perform this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to which
it is a party, or to timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Seller and each Selling Subsidiary has all requisite organizational
power and authority to own and operate the Business and to conduct the
Business as now conducted.

and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, and to perform its obligations hereunder
and thereunder. Each Selling Subsidiary has all requisite corporate (or
similar entity) power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and
each of the Ancillary Agreements to which each is a party, and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and performance
by Seller of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party has been duly and validly authorized by Seller and no additional
corporate authorization or consent by Seller is required in connection
therewith. The execution, delivery and performance by each Selling Subsidiary
of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party
has been duly and validly authorized by such Selling Subsidiary and no
additional corporate (or similar entity) authorization or consent by such
Selling Subsidiary is required in connection therewith. The execution,
delivery and performance by Seller and each Selling Subsidiary of this
Agreement and each of the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, does not
require an affirmative vote of the security holders of Seller, any Selling
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, whether under applicable Law
(including Delaware Law), stock exchange rules, Contract or otherwise.

Section 3.3. Binding Effect. This Agreement constitutes a valid and legally
binding obligation of Seller and each Selling Subsidiary, enforceable against
Seller and each Selling Subsidiary in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, or moratorium Laws, other similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies.

Section 3.4. Regulatory Approvals. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.4 or as
required under the HSR Act (the "Seller Regulatory Approvals"), no
Governmental Authorization is required to be obtained by Seller or any Selling
Subsidiary from, or to be given by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary to, or
made by Seller or any Selling Subsidiary with, any Governmental Entity or
securities exchange, in each case in respect of the Business, as a result of
the execution, delivery or performance of its obligations under this Agreement
or its obligations under the Ancillary Agreements, except for such
Governmental Authorization that if failed to be obtained, given or made would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Business or the Purchased Assets or materially impede Seller or the
Selling Subsidiaries' ability to execute, deliver or perform this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, or to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

Section 3.5. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller and each Selling Subsidiary of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is (or 

will be) a party, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, do not and will not (a) violate any provision of the
Organizational Documents of Seller or any Selling Subsidiary, as applicable,

approvals, waivers and authorizations set forth on Schedule 3.5 (the "Seller
Non-Governmental Consents"), conflict with, or result in the breach of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration (whether after the filing of notice or the lapse
of time or both) of any right or obligation of Seller or any Selling
Subsidiary under, or result in a loss of any benefit to which Seller or any
Selling Subsidiary is entitled under, any Transferred Contract required to be
listed in Schedule 3.12 to which Seller or such Selling Subsidiary is a party,
or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Purchased Assets, in
each case in respect of the Business or, (c) assuming the receipt of all
Regulatory Approvals, violate or result in a breach of, or constitute a
default under, any Law or Governmental Authorization to which Seller or such
Selling Subsidiary is subject, in each case in respect of the Business,
except, in the case of clause (b) and clause (c) above, for such violations,
breaches, defaults or other matters that would not be material to the Business
or the Purchased Assets, or materially impede the ability of Seller or each
Selling Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement or under
the Ancillary Agreements, or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

Section 3.6. Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6(a), Seller or the
applicable Selling Subsidiary has good and valid title to all of the Purchased

the ordinary course of business and not in violation of this Agreement), in

Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6(b),
there are no assets, properties or services owned by Seller, any of the
Selling Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates used primarily in

Efforts to obtain and to cooperate in obtaining any Governmental
Authorizations, Regulatory Approvals and Non-Governmental Consents required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall make the filings required of it or any of its Affiliates under
the HSR Act in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than
seven (7) Business Days after the date hereof and request early termination of
the waiting period, and shall make the filings required of it or any of its
Affiliates under any other 

Competition Law as promptly as reasonably practicable. All filing fees payable
to any Governmental Entity in connection with such filings and notifications
shall be paid by Buyer. The parties hereby agree to diligently pursue
termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or any other Competition
Law (including promptly responding to any requests for additional
information). Each party shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to cooperate
with the other party in such other party's efforts to obtain any Non-
Governmental Consents as are required in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, neither Buyer nor Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any obligation to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of any assets or businesses (or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits the freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
any businesses, product lines, or assets) in order to obtain any clearance
under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law or to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or
other order in any Litigation (or threatened to be instituted), and neither
Buyer nor Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to
litigate any of the foregoing matters.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their
respective Reasonable Best Efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,

its part under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and applicable Law
to satisfy the conditions to Closing, and to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as
soon as practicable.

(c) Buyer and Seller each shall, upon request by the other and subject to
applicable Law and appropriate confidentiality restrictions, furnish the other
with all material documentation concerning the Business on the one hand, or
Buyer, on the other hand, and such other matters as may be necessary or
reasonably advisable in connection with any notices, reports, statements,
applications or other filings made by or on behalf of Buyer, Seller or any of
their respective Affiliates to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;
provided that any such documentation furnished by the parties to one another
may be redacted to the extent necessary, either to comply with applicable Law,
including Competition Law, or to protect the confidentiality of any
information that is confidential to a third party in such documentation where
the third party's consent to the disclosure of such documentation is
conditioned upon the redaction of the information concerned.

(d) Subject to applicable Law or as prohibited by any Governmental Entity,
Buyer and Seller each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
(i) promptly notifying the other of any facts, circumstances or other reason
that would prevent the receipt of any Regulatory Approvals or the Non-
Governmental Consents for the timely consummation of transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, (ii) promptly furnishing the
other with copies of material notices or other communications received by
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, from 

any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (iii) permit
the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any
such Governmental Entity and incorporate the other party's reasonable
comments; provided that any such notices furnished by the parties to one
another may be redacted to the extent necessary, either to comply with
applicable Law or to protect the confidentiality of information that if
furnished would not facilitate the other party's understanding of the status
of matters relating to consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
None of Seller or Buyer shall permit any of its officers or any other
representatives or agents to participate in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Entity with respect to any filings, investigation or other
inquiry relating to the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall, without the prior written
consent from such other party, (i) take any action that has the effect of
extending any waiting period under the HSR Act or comparable period under any
other Competition Law, including withdrawing or re-filing any notice, reports,
or other submissions, or (ii) enter into any agreement with the U.S.
Department of Justice or the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or any other
Governmental Entity to voluntarily delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(e) Subject to applicable Law and except as required by any Governmental
Entity, neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action that would be
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the receipt of any
Governmental Authorizations, Regulatory Approvals or Non-Governmental
Consents, in each case, to the extent necessary for the timely consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

its Affiliate) or Buyer (or its Affiliate), as applicable, shall seek
confidential treatment for any portion of such Form 8-K or any exhibits
thereto that are reasonably requested by the other party. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at no time after the date hereof
shall Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates make any public statement
concerning the Business or Seller's (or its Affiliates') operation or Buyer's
(or its Affiliates') operation of the Business that is disparaging toward the

(b) Subject to Section 5.4(a), the terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary

(c) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing, Seller shall maintain
as confidential and shall not use or disclose (except as required by Law or as
authorized in writing 

by Buyer) any Confidential Information that was known by, acquired by, or
disclosed to Seller prior to the Closing, by using the same degree of care
that was used to protect the same information before the date of this
Agreement, except that the foregoing obligation will not apply to any
information which (a) was, is now, or becomes generally available to the

appropriate steps to safeguard such Confidential Information and to protect it

that was used to protect the same information before the date of this
Agreement. In the event Seller or any of its Representatives is required by
Law to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the legal
requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall reasonably
cooperate, at Buyer's reasonable expense, with Buyer to preserve the
confidentiality of such information consistent with applicable law.

(d) This Section 5.4 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Closing.

Section 5.5. Intellectual Property; No Use of Certain Names.

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement grants
or shall be deemed to grant to Buyer or its Affiliates the right to use or any
interest in any Intellectual Property Rights of Seller, any Selling Subsidiary
or any of their respective Affiliates that are not included in the Purchased
Assets (collectively, the "Seller Intellectual Property") or the Ancillary
Agreements, including any names used by Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates (such as "BandG Foods" or "BandG" (which shall include
lower case and capitalized versions of such names)) (the "Seller Names"), any
logos used by Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates
(the "Seller Logos") or any trademark, trade name, service mark or other
similar mark or similar right which is a derivative of any Seller Name or
Seller Logo. The prohibitions in this Section 5.5 shall apply to any and all
uses whatsoever of the Seller Intellectual Property including the use of the
Seller Intellectual Property on any stationery or invoices or otherwise, which
identify or in any way make use of the Seller Intellectual Property. 

(b) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Business, promptly, and in any event (a)
within 180 days after the Closing, to revise print advertising, Product
labeling and all other information or other materials, including any internet
or other electronic communications vehicles, to delete all references to the
Seller Intellectual Property and (b) within 180 days after the Closing, to
change signage and stationery and otherwise discontinue use of the Seller
Intellectual Property; provided, however, that for a period of 180 days after
the Closing Date, Buyer may continue to distribute product literature relating
to the Business that uses any Seller Intellectual Property and distribute
Products with labeling that uses any Seller Intellectual Property to the
extent that such product literature and labeling exists on the Closing Date,
and, if applicable, Buyer may continue to use building signs for the
reasonable duration of time it takes to replace such building signs. In no
event shall Buyer or the Business use any Seller Intellectual Property after
the Closing in any manner or for any purpose different from the use of such
Seller Intellectual Property by Seller and the Selling Subsidiaries during the
30-day period preceding the Closing. With respect to the Transferred
Inventory, Buyer may continue to sell such Transferred Inventory,
notwithstanding that it may bear one or more of the Seller Intellectual
Property, for a reasonable time after the Closing (not to exceed 180 days).

(c) Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement
grants or shall be deemed to grant to Seller, any Selling Subsidiary or any of
its or their respective Affiliates the right to use or any interest in any
Intellectual Property Rights of Buyer and its Affiliates, including, without
limitation, any names used by Buyer and its Affiliates ("Buyer Names"), any
logos used by Buyer and its Affiliates ("Buyer Logos"), or any trademark,
trade name, service mark or other similar mark or similar right which is a
derivative of any Buyer Name or Buyer Logo. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller covenants that promptly following the Closing Date, and in any event
within 180 days thereafter, except to the extent necessary for Seller to
fulfill its obligations under the Transition Services Agreement, it shall
cease and desist from any and all use of works, content or other materials
that combine or share any images, marks, content or other materials included
within the Purchased Assets with any retained assets or other brands, marks,
content or other assets of Seller, any Selling Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Affiliates, including, for example, any publication in any media
format of any and all content listing Pirate's Booty® as Seller's brand, and
all co-branding or co-distribution arrangements combining the Pirate's Booty®
brand with any other brand.

Section 5.6. Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller or
any Selling Subsidiary with the provisions of any so-called bulk transfer Laws
of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale to Buyer of the Purchased
Assets; provided that failure to comply with any such bulk transfer Laws shall
not change the Seller Parties' obligation to indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates for Excluded Liabilities (including Taxes set forth in Section
2.4(f)) pursuant to Section 8.3(c).

Section 5.7. Further Assurances. At any time after the date hereof, but
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Seller and Buyer shall promptly
execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents reasonably
requested by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and necessary for Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be, to satisfy their respective obligations hereunder.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably 

cooperate to ensure that Seller has possession of the Excluded Assets after
Closing and Buyer has possession of the Purchased Assets after Closing. From
and after the Closing, if either party or its Affiliate receives or collects
any funds that are allocated hereunder to the other party, such receiving
party shall, or shall cause its Affiliate to, promptly remit such funds to the
other party. To the extent that Seller or any Selling Subsidiary or any of
their respective Affiliates holds or is licensed any assets, licenses or
rights that would constitute Purchased Assets, subject to Section 2.8 as
applicable, Seller or such Selling Subsidiary will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, contribute, transfer, assign or otherwise convey such assets,
licenses or rights to Buyer for no consideration as promptly as practicable
following discovery.

Section 5.9. Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to
occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
ARTICLE VIII, each Seller Party shall not, directly or indirectly, through any
officer, director, employee, agent or Affiliate, enter into any agreement,
agreement in principle or other commitment (whether or not legally binding)
relating to any business combination with, recapitalization of, or acquisition
or purchase of all or any material portion of the Business (other than the
inventory in the ordinary course of the Business), whether structured as a
merger, stock purchase, license, recapitalization, lease, asset transaction or
otherwise (a "Competing Transaction"), or solicit, initiate or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating to any Competing
Transaction, nor participate in any or continue any ongoing discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any Person to effect a
Competing Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 5.9, this Agreement shall in no event restrict or limit any
Seller discussions or negotiations in respect of a sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets or equity of Seller; provided that this
sentence shall not permit any Seller Party or its Affiliates to abdicate this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or otherwise avoid its obligations to
consummate the Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 5.10. Non-Competition; Non-Solicit.

(a) Each of the Seller Parties agrees that, for a period of two (2) years
immediately following the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), such Seller
Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
whether as owner, partner, investor, consultant, agent, co-venturer or
otherwise, engage in the business of manufacturing, packaging, marketing,
distributing or selling salty snacks "puffs" products intended for human
consumption (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) crackers, (y) pita or
(z) products marketed under Seller's "Back to Nature" or "New York Style"
brands as of the date hereof) anywhere in the United States, Canada or Mexico
("Competing Activities"); provided, however, that Seller and any of its
Affiliates may acquire, directly or indirectly, (i) the securities of any
Person that engages in any of the Competing Activities if Seller and its
Affiliates do not, directly or indirectly, collectively own more than 20% of
the aggregate outstanding equity securities of such person and (ii) any Person
that engages in any of the Competing Activities if such Competing Activities
account for less than 15% of the consolidated annual revenues or assets of
such person. 

(b) Each of the Seller Parties agrees that, during the Restricted Period, such
Seller Party will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit or encourage any Person who is or has been a co-
packer, co-manufacturer, distributor, vendor, supplier, independent contractor
or other business partner of the Business as of or within nine (9) months
immediately preceding the Closing Date to terminate or materially diminish its
relationship with the Business, (ii) intentionally divert revenue from the
Business by persuading any such business partner, or any Person who is or has
been a prospective co-packer, co-manufacturer, distributor, vendor, supplier,
independent contractor or other business partner of the Business as of or
within nine (9) months immediately preceding the Closing Date, to conduct with
anyone else a material amount of business or activity which such business
partner or prospective business partner conducts or would reasonably be
expected to conduct with the Business or with Buyer or any of its Affiliates;
provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that a
Seller Party generally competes for "shelf space" of any such business partner
in the ordinary course of business and in a manner that is not directed at
specifically competing directly with the Business and is not otherwise in
violation of this Section 5.10, such action shall not constitute a violation
on the part of such Seller Party of this Section 5.10(b), or (iii) seek to
hire or engage any employee of Buyer or its Affiliates with whom the Seller
Parties came into contact as a result of negotiating the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a general solicitation by
a Seller Party by form letter, blanket mailing or published advertisement that
is not directed at any of the Persons described in this Section 5.10(b) shall
not, solely by reason thereof, constitute a violation on the part of such
Seller Party of this Section 5.10(b).

(c) Each Seller Party agrees that its agreement to the covenants contained in
this Section 5.10 is a material condition of Buyer's willingness to enter into
this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) the
covenants contained in this Section 5.10 are necessary to protect the
goodwill, confidential information, trade secrets and other legitimate
interests of the Business, (iii) in addition and not in the alternative to any
other remedies available to it, Buyer shall be entitled to preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by a
Seller Party of any such covenants, without having to post bond, (iv) the
Restricted Period shall be tolled, and shall not run, during the period of any
breach by a Seller Party of any such covenants, (v) no claimed breach of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements shall operate to extinguish
Seller's obligation to comply with this Section 5.10, and (vi) in the event
that the final judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction declares any
term or provision of this Section 5.10 to be invalid or unenforceable by
reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic
area or too great a range of activities, that provision shall be deemed to be
modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 5.11. Payoff Letters. On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
have received from Seller payoff letters, lien releases and discharges (or
agreements therefor) terminating all Liens, other than Permitted Liens,
encumbering any Purchased Asset as set forth in Schedules 3.6 and 3.10, each
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer.Release. Effective as of
the Closing, each Seller Party, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and
each of their respective successors and assigns (each a "Releasor"), hereby
irrevocably waives, remises, releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable laws, Buyer 

and its Affiliates, and each of their respective past, present or future
officers, managers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, employees,
counsel and agents (each a "Released Party") from any and all charges,
complaints, claims, suits, judgments, demands, actions, obligations (including
obligations of the Business to indemnify a Seller Party or its Affiliates) or
liabilities, damages, causes of action, rights, costs, loans, debts and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs actually incurred) of
any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued, contingent or
otherwise, which such Releasor ever had, now has or may have on or by reason
of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever prior to the Closing Date and
relating to the Business against the Released Parties in its capacity as the
owner of the Purchased Assets or the Business (the "Released Claims");
provided, however, that "Released Claims" shall not include any right or claim
any Releasor may have under this Agreement, or any Ancillary Agreement
including, without limitation, a Releasor's rights to enforce the rights,
remedies and all other provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements pursuant to the terms hereto or thereto. Seller acknowledges and
agrees that its agreement to the general release of claims contained in this
paragraph is a material condition of Buyer's willingness to enter into and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.13. Insurance. In the event that the Closing occurs and there shall
exist or occur any acts, facts, circumstances or omissions, whether known or
unknown at the Closing, relating to the Business and that is not an Excluded
Liability in respect of which Seller, the Selling Subsidiaries or their
respective Affiliates may reasonably be entitled to coverage in respect of the
Business under the insurance policies of Seller and Buyer is not entitled to a
substantially similar level of coverage under any of the insurance policies of
Buyer as exists under such Seller insurance policies (the "Pre-Closing
Occurrences"), (i) Buyer shall promptly give notice to Seller and (ii) at
Buyer's request, Seller and its Affiliates shall (A) use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly report any and all Pre-Closing Occurrences and
collect any amounts payable under any relevant insurance policies in
connection therewith and (B) remit such amounts, if any (calculated net of any
deductibles and collection costs incurred in collecting such recovery), to
Buyer promptly following receipt thereof.

Article VI 
TAX MATTERS

Section 6.1. Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller shall each bear 50% of the
aggregate cost of all local, state, foreign or other excise, sales, use, value
added, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp,
documentary, filing, recordation and other similar taxes and fees that may be
imposed or assessed as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, together with any inflation adjustment, interest,
additions or penalties with respect thereto and any inflation adjustment or
interest with respect to such additions or penalties ("Transfer Taxes"), and
Buyer shall reimburse the Seller Parties for 50% of any Transfer Taxes paid to
a Taxing Authority by any Seller Party and the Seller Parties shall reimburse
the Buyer for 50% of any Transfer Taxes paid to a Taxing Authority by Buyer.
Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any Tax
Returns or other documentation required to be filed in connection with such
Transfer Taxes; provided that the Seller Parties agree to cooperate with Buyer
in the filing of any such Tax Returns or other documentation (including 

reasonably promptly supplying any relevant information in their possession)
and shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation
if required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if permitted by
applicable Law, Buyer, Seller and each Selling Subsidiary will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any resale certificate or similar
documentation that would reduce or eliminate the amount of Transfer Taxes due
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.2. Allocation of the Purchase Price.

(a) At least seven calendar days prior to the Closing Date, and consistent in
all respects with the allocation principles set forth on Schedule A3, Buyer
shall provide Seller with an estimate of the allocation of the Purchase Price
plus any amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, including the Assumed Liabilities, among the Purchased Assets, and
among Seller and each of the Selling Subsidiaries, in accordance with the
Section 1060 of the Code. This estimate will be used at the Closing. If Seller
does not agree with such estimate, Seller and Buyer shall use good faith
efforts to agree on an estimate prior to the Closing Date. If the parties
cannot agree on such estimate prior to the Closing Date, Buyer's estimate
shall be used for allocating the total consideration pursuant to this
Agreement at the Closing and shall be dispositive for Transfer Tax purposes.

(b) Within ninety (90) days of the determination of the Final Payment Amount
and consistent in all respects with the allocation principles set forth on
Schedule A3, Seller will determine the allocation of the final Purchase Price
plus any other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes, including the Assumed Liabilities among the Purchased Assets and the
Retained Technology License, and among Seller and each of the Selling
Subsidiaries (the "Allocation") in accordance with the Section 1060 of the
Code. Buyer shall have a period of fifteen (15) days following the delivery of
the proposed Allocation to notify Seller in writing of any disagreement with
the proposed Allocation. Failure to notify Seller in writing of any
disagreement within such fifteen (15) day period shall be deemed acceptance by
Buyer of Seller's proposed Allocation. In the event Buyer timely notifies
Seller in writing of any disagreement, Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good
faith to resolve the disagreement. If within twenty (20) days after delivery
by Buyer of the written notice of disagreement, Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve such disagreement in writing, the parties shall each prepare their
respective determination of the Allocation (for Tax purposes) and submit such
determinations to a Neutral Arbitrator, along with a written submission in
support of their respective positions. In the event a dispute is submitted to
the Neutral Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 6.2(b), the Neutral Arbitrator
shall, within twenty (20) days after the date both parties submit their
respective determinations of the Allocation, make a determination only as to
those matters in dispute and render a written report as to the disputed
matters and the resulting Allocation. The Neutral Arbitrator's determinations
shall be set forth in writing and shall be final and binding on Buyer and
Seller. The cost of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be split equally between
Buyer and Seller. The parties shall report, act and file their respective Tax
Returns (including Form 8594, as applicable) in accordance with the Allocation
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 6.2(b), and any adjustments
thereto and shall not take any position on a 

Tax Return or in a Tax audit or similar proceeding inconsistent with such
Allocation except upon a final determination by the applicable Taxing

disputes with any Taxing Authority regarding, any Taxes or Tax Returns of
Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, (ii) make available to the other party or
parties, as the case may be, as reasonably requested, all information in its

their agents', inspection and copying of such Books and Records shall be borne
by Seller.

(ii) of this sentence or the survival period in clause (iii) of this sentence,
each a "Survival Date"), (ii) the representations and warranties contained in

Section 8.2. Buyer Acknowledgment.

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and each of its
Affiliates, that (i) it is reasonable for Buyer to rely solely on the
representations or warranties of the Seller Parties specifically contained in
this Agreement and the other Seller Representations and (ii) the Seller
Parties have not made, and the Seller Parties do not make and specifically
negate and disclaim any representations, warranties, promises, covenants,
agreements or guarantees of any kind or character whatsoever, whether express
or implied, oral or written, past, present, or future, of, as to, concerning
or with respect to (except as (and solely to the extent) set forth in the
Seller Representations): (A) the nature, quality or condition (financial or
otherwise) of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or
(B) the suitability of the Purchased Assets for any and all activities and
uses that Buyer may conduct therewith or thereon. BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT IT IS ACQUIRING THE PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS"
BASIS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.2 shall limit
Buyer's rights with respect to recovery for breaches of Seller Representations
or to pursue claims for fraud.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
that it (i) has made or waived the opportunity to make its own inquiry and
investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities,
(ii) has been furnished with or given adequate access to such information
about the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as it has
requested and (iii) will not assert any claim against any Seller Party or any
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives or hold any Seller Party or

inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to information described
in Section 8.2(c) (other than as set forth in the following sentence)
furnished by the Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives concerning the Seller Parties, the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 8.2 shall limit Buyer's rights with respect to recovery for
breaches of Seller Representations or to pursue claims for fraud.

(c) In connection with Buyer's investigation of the Business, the Purchased
Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer and its Representatives have received
from Seller (directly or through its Representatives) certain projections,
estimates and other forecasts and certain business plan information (including
a Confidential Presentation, dated June 25, 2018, and information, documents
or material made available to Buyer and its representatives in certain "data
rooms" (whether electronic or otherwise), management presentations or any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Ancillary Agreements) (collectively, "Projections"). Buyer acknowledges
that there are uncertainties inherent in 

attempting to make such Projections, that it is familiar with such
uncertainties, that none of Seller or any of its Affiliates, nor any of their
respective Representatives or direct or indirect equityholders or any other
Person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to
the accuracy or completeness of any Projections, any written or oral
information regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities furnished or made available to Buyer or its Representatives or
otherwise with respect to the Business, Seller or the Selling Subsidiaries, or
its or their operations, business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or
prospects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8.2 shall
limit Buyer's rights with respect to recovery for breaches of Seller
Representations or to pursue claims for fraud.

Section 8.3. Indemnification by Seller. Subject to the terms of this Article
VIII, from and after the Closing, the Seller Parties shall jointly and
severally indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, Affiliates, agents and representatives,
and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") and defend and hold
them harmless from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by a
Buyer Indemnified Party resulting from, arising out of or related to (a) any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by a Seller Party
in this Agreement (it being agreed for purposes of determining any such breach
or inaccuracy that such representations and warranties are deemed made as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date (except for such
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date which shall
speak only as of such date)) (provided that for the purposes of this clause
(a), qualifications as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other
qualifiers of similar import contained in such representations and warranties
shall not be given effect for determining whether a breach of such
representations and warranties has occurred or for purposes of calculating any
Losses), to the extent that a Buyer Indemnified Party provides written notice
of such breach or inaccuracy (which notice shall describe the applicable
breach or inaccuracy in reasonable detail and indicate a good faith estimated
amount, if known and quantifiable, of Losses that have been or would
reasonably be expected to be sustained by the applicable Buyer Indemnified
Party in connection therewith) to Seller prior to the applicable Survival Date
(or at any time permitted by law, in the case of the Fundamental
Representations), (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of a Seller
Party contained in this Agreement, or (c) any Excluded Liabilities. 

Section 8.4. Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the terms of this Article
VIII, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders,
Affiliates, agents and representatives, and each of the heirs, executors,
successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties") and defend and hold them harmless from and against any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by a Seller Indemnified Party resulting
from, arising out of or related to (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement (it being agreed
that for purposes of determining any such breach or inaccuracy such
representations and warranties are deemed made as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date (except for such representations and
warranties that are made as of a specific date which shall speak only as of
such date)), to the extent that a Seller Indemnified Party provides written
notice of such breach or inaccuracy (which notice shall describe the
applicable breach or inaccuracy in reasonable detail and indicate the
estimated amount, if known or quantifiable, of Losses that have been or may be
sustained by the applicable Seller Indemnified Party in connection therewith)
to Buyer prior to the applicable Survival Date (or at any time permitted by
law, in the case of the Fundamental Representations), (b) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement to which it is a
party or (c) any Assumed Liabilities.

Section 8.5. Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The indemnification provided for in Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.4 is
subject to the following limitations:

(i) subject to Section 8.5(a)(ii), Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect to the matters described in
Section 8.3(a) (other than breaches of the Fundamental Representations, or the
representations and warranties in Section 3.13 (Taxes), which shall not be
subject to such limitation), (A) unless such Losses exceed an aggregate amount
equal to $3,150,000 (the "Threshold Amount") and then only for Losses in
excess of $2,100,000 and (B) in excess of $37,800,000 (the "Cap"), except that
with respect to any Losses for breaches of the representations and warranties
in Section 3.6(b), the "Cap" shall instead be $63,000,000;

(ii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Loss, or any Losses
arising out of the same or substantially similar facts and circumstances,
shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 8.3(a) or Section
8.4(a) (other than breaches of the Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties in Section 3.13 (Taxes), which shall not be
subject to such limitation) and shall not be indemnifiable or counted toward
satisfaction of the Threshold Amount unless they exceed $75,000 individually
or in the aggregate;

(iii) Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties for any
Losses with respect to the matters described in Section 8.4(a) (other than
breaches of Fundamental Representations of Buyer, which shall not be subject
to such limitation), (A) unless such Losses exceed the Threshold Amount and
then only for Losses in excess of $2,100,000 and (B) in excess of the Cap; 

(iv) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties, and Buyer
shall not be liable to the Seller Indemnified Parties, for any Losses
hereunder in excess of the Base Closing Cash Payment;

(v) neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any obligations under or liabilities
in respect of Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.4(a) (except in respect of the
Fundamental Representations, with respect to which claims for indemnity may be
made at any time permitted by law) from and after the applicable Survival
Date; provided that any claim for indemnity made by a Buyer Indemnified Party
or Seller Indemnified Party under Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.4(a), as the
case may be, in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Date will survive beyond the applicable
Survival Date until such claim is finally and conclusively resolved; and

(vi) each Buyer Indemnified Party and Seller Indemnified Party shall, to the
extent required by applicable Law, mitigate any indemnifiable Loss upon and
after becoming aware of any event giving rise to such Losses.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as provided in
Section 2.6 (Purchase Price Adjustment), Article VI (Tax Matters), Article IX
(Termination) or Section 10.6 (Equitable Relief), and in the Ancillary
Agreements, the rights and remedies of Buyer and Seller, and any Buyer
Indemnified Party and any Seller Indemnified Party (each Buyer Indemnified
Party and Seller Indemnified Party is referred to herein as an "Indemnified
Party"), under this Article VIII are exclusive and in lieu of any and all
other rights and remedies which Buyer or Seller, or any Indemnified Party, may
have under this Agreement with respect to this Agreement and with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and with respect to the
Purchased Assets and the Business, except in case of fraud.

Section 8.6. Adjustments to Losses.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall have any right to indemnification under this Article VIII with
respect to any Losses to the extent such Losses would constitute a double-
recovery of the same Loss for the Buyer Indemnified Parties.

(b) For all purposes of Section 8.3 and Section 8.4, "Losses" shall be net of
any amounts actually paid (and such netting shall only become effective upon
receipt of any such payment) to an Indemnified Party under any insurance
policy or indemnity, contribution or similar payment pursuant to a Contract,
net of costs of collection and increases in premiums in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification hereunder. Each Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any amounts payable
under any insurance policy or indemnity, contribution or similar Contract;
provided that any failure to recover such amounts shall not reduce such
Indemnified Party's Losses hereunder. If an Indemnified Party receives such an
amount from such insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar
payment in respect of a Loss subject to indemnification hereunder and all or a
portion of such Loss has been paid by or at the direction of the Indemnifying
Party 

hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit such amount recovered to
the Indemnifying Party.

Section 8.7. Characterization of Indemnification Payments. To the extent
permitted under applicable Law, all payments made (or deemed to be made, in
accordance with this Agreement) by any Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified
Party with respect to any claim pursuant to Section 8.3 or Section 8.4 shall
be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

Section 8.8. Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party
could reasonably be expected to have liability to any Indemnified Party
hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified
Party by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (and shall use reasonable efforts to do so no later than twenty (20)
days following the Indemnified Party's discovery of the assertion of such a
claim) notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or
the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then
reasonably ascertainable and a reasonably detailed explanation of the events
giving rise to such Third-Party Claim (to the extent then reasonably
ascertainable) (a "Claim Notice"); provided that the failure to timely give a
Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. Promptly following
delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all material documents (including court papers) that have
been received prior to such time by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in
writing within thirty (30) days that it elects to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party actively and diligently and shall have the power
to direct and control such defense at its expense; provided that, prior to
assuming the defense, the Indemnifying Party covenants and agrees that that it
is required to indemnify the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement with
respect to any Losses from such Third-Party Claim (subject to the applicable
limitations of this Article VIII); provided further that the Indemnifying
Party will not have the right to assume or continue control of the defense of
any Third-Party Claim to the extent: (i) the Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal or regulatory proceeding, (ii) the
Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against any
Indemnified Party other than as an ancillary claim, (iii) the Third-Party
Claim involves Taxes, (iv) the Third-Party Claim is brought on or behalf of
one of the customers or suppliers listed on Schedule 3.15(a) or 3.15(b) and
primarily relates to the Business, (v) the Third-Party Claim seeks an amount
of Losses in excess of the Cap, or (vi) the Indemnifying Party does not
actively and diligently conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim. Once the
Indemnifying Party has made such election (if permitted pursuant to the
above), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in (but not
control) any such defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at
such Indemnified Party's own 

expense. The Indemnifying Party may not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, except that no such consent will be required if such
settlement or judgment (i) provides as the sole relief monetary damages
(including any expenses and fees) that are reimbursed to the Indemnified Party
in full as Losses, (ii) does not entail any admission of liability on the part
of any Indemnified Party and (iii) releases the Indemnified Parties
unconditionally from all liability or Losses in connection with such Third-
Party Claim and the facts and circumstances underlying such Third Party Claim.
Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing reasonable access to each other's relevant Books and Records, and
employees. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of Books
and Records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees and Representatives available on a mutually
convenient basis during normal business hours to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

Section 8.9. Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures. Each Indemnified Party
shall assert any claim on account of any Losses which do not result from a
Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by giving the Indemnifying Party written
notice thereof reasonably promptly; provided that the failure to timely give
such notice shall not affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party
shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail and indicate the
estimated amount, if known or quantifiable, of Losses that have been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party. The party asserting such a claim may
determine any time to pursue a claim for any applicable judicial or other
proceedings in furtherance of such claim.

Section 8.10. Remedies Cumulative. Subject to Section 8.6(a), the rights of
the Indemnified Parties under this Article VIII are cumulative, and each
Indemnified Party will have the right in any particular circumstance, in its
sole discretion, to enforce any provision of this Article VIII without regard
to the availability of a remedy under any other provision of this Article
VIII.

Article IX 

TERMINATION 

Section 9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a) by written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by any one of Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other party, on or after the day that is 270 days after the
date hereof (and if such day is not a Business Day, then the next following
Business Day) (the "Outside Date"), if the Closing shall not have occurred,
subject to Section 10.6, prior to the Outside Date; provided that neither
Seller, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) at any time during which such party
is in material breach of this Agreement;

(c) by Buyer, if there has been a material violation or breach by Seller of
any representation or warranty (or any such representation or warranty shall
have become untrue in any material respect after the date of this Agreement)
or covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which, in either case,
would prevent the satisfaction of or result in the failure of any condition to
the obligations of Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach has not
been waived by Buyer or, in the case of a breach of any covenant or agreement
under this Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by Seller within ten
(10) days after receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach from Buyer;
provided, however, that Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(c) at any time during which Buyer is in such material breach
of this Agreement; or

(d) by Seller, if there has been a material violation or breach by Buyer of
any representation or warranty (or any such representation or warranty shall
have become untrue in any material respect after the date of this Agreement)
or covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which would, in either
case, prevent the satisfaction of or result in the failure of any condition to
the obligations of Seller at the Closing and such violation or breach has not
been waived by Seller or, with respect to a breach of any covenant or
agreement under this Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by Buyer
within ten (10) days after receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach
from Seller; provided, however, that Seller may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) at any time during which Seller is in such
material breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1, this Agreement, insofar as it
relates to the parties' rights and obligations relating thereto, shall
thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party shall have any
liability to the other party or their respective Affiliates, or their
respective directors, officers, equityholders, partners, members, attorneys,
accountants, agents, representatives or employees or their heirs, successors
and permitted assigns, except for the obligations of the parties contained in
Section 5.4, this Section 9.2 and Article X (including Section 10.6) (and any
related definitional provisions set forth in this Agreement or Appendix A),
and except that nothing in this Section shall relieve the Seller Parties from
liability for any fraud or willful breach of this Agreement that arose prior
to such termination.

Section 10.2. Amendment; Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended, modified, supplemented or waived if, and only if, such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by Buyer and Seller, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom such waiver is intended to be effective. No failure or delay by
any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege.

Section 10.3. No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto and any purported assignment
in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void; provided, however, that
Buyer may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or
more of its Subsidiaries (it being understood that such assignment shall not
relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder). Except as expressly set forth in
Article VIII, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person other than Buyer and Seller, and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights, benefits
or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 10.4. Entire Agreement; Inconsistency. This Agreement (including all
Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices hereto and all certificates delivered
pursuant hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
contain the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters. In the event
and to the extent that there shall be an inconsistency between the provisions
of this Agreement and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or an
Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and neither in
favor of nor against any party hereto irrespective of which party caused such
provisions to be drafted. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has
been represented by an attorney in connection with the preparation and
execution of this Agreement (including all Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices
hereto and all certificates delivered pursuant hereto), the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Upon consummation of the Closing, 

the Clean Team Agreement between Buyer and Seller shall automatically
terminate and be of no further force or effect.

Section 10.5. Satisfaction of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other under this Agreement, that is performed, satisfied or fulfilled
completely by an Affiliate of such party shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

Section 10.6. Equitable Relief. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed by Buyer or the Seller
Parties as required by their specific terms or were to be otherwise breached,
irreparable damage will occur to the non-breaching parties, no adequate remedy
at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that the
non-breaching parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches, and to specific performance of the terms, of this Agreement
(including causing the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on
the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement)
without posting any bond and without proving that monetary damages would be
inadequate, in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. The breaching
party shall not oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to raise as a
defense that an adequate remedy at Law exists or that specific performance or
equitable or injunctive relief is inappropriate or unavailable. The parties
hereto further agree that nothing in this Section 10.6 shall require any party
to institute any Litigation for (or limit any party's right to institute any
Litigation for) specific performance under this Section 10.6 prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Article IX, nor shall the
commencement of any Litigation pursuant to this Section 10.6 or anything set
forth in this Section 10.6 restrict or limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof. If a party brings any
Litigation to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other party (or a Litigation for monetary damages as described
in the following sentence) and the Outside Date has not yet passed, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by such time period established
by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or such other court of
competent jurisdiction pursuant to the terms of Section 10.9) presiding over
such Litigation. If Buyer or Seller institutes a Litigation for injunctive
relief or specific performance and a court of competent jurisdiction, in a
final order, judgment, injunction or decree in accordance with this Section
10.6, declines to award injunctive relief or specific performance to Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, then Buyer or Seller, as applicable, may institute a
Litigation pursuing monetary damages against Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement. If such a court has
granted such an award of monetary damages against Buyer for its failure to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, Seller may enforce such award and accept damages for
such alleged breach, only if, within three (3) Business Days following such
award, Buyer has not consummated the Closing or Buyer has not irrevocably
notified Seller that Buyer stands ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing as promptly as reasonably practicable and that all of Buyer's
conditions to closing have been satisfied or waived and Buyer consummates the
Closing within ten (10) Business Days after providing such irrevocable notice.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Seller is
awarded injunctive relief or specific performance as a result of which the
Closing actually occurs, such equitable relief shall be Seller's sole and 

exclusive remedy against Buyer under this Agreement, other than Seller's
remedies pursuant to Article VIII.

Section 10.7. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Sections
4.6, 5.2(a) and 6.1, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the
party incurring such costs and expenses.

Section 10.8. Schedules. The disclosure by Seller or Buyer of any matter, or
reference to any Contract, in any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed
to be a disclosure of such matter or Contract with respect to each of the
representations and warranties contained herein for which the relevance of
such matter or Contract is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure,
but shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by Buyer or Seller or to
otherwise imply that any such matter or Contract is material for the purposes
of this Agreement and shall not affect the interpretation of such term for the
purposes of this Agreement. In particular, (a) certain matters may be
disclosed on the Schedules that may not be required to be disclosed because of
certain minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement, (b) the disclosure of any such matter does not mean that it meets
or surpasses any such minimum thresholds or materiality standards and (c) no
disclosure in the Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of
any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Matters reflected in
a Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters or Contracts required by
this Agreement to be disclosed in such Schedules. Regardless of the existence
or absence of cross-references, the disclosure of any matter in any Schedule
shall be deemed to be a disclosure for purposes of each Schedule to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent from its text.
The section headings (but not the numbering of the Schedules) in the Schedules
are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or
affect the meaning or interpretation of any information disclosed herein or
any provision of this Agreement. All attachments to the Schedules are
incorporated by reference into the Schedule in which they are directly or
indirectly referenced. The information contained in the Schedules is in all
events subject to Section 5.4 and the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 10.9. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum.
This Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements made and to be performed wholly within that jurisdiction. Each
party hereto, for itself and its successors and assigns, irrevocably agrees
that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement shall be instituted only in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware nor
any such federal court has jurisdiction, any other state court located in the
State of Delaware, and generally and unconditionally accepts and irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably
agrees to be bound by any final judgment rendered thereby from which no appeal
has been taken or is available in connection with this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement. Each party, for itself and its successors and assigns,
irrevocably waives 

any objection it may have now or hereafter to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding, including any objection based on the grounds
of forum non conveniens, in the aforesaid courts.

Section 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (c) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
(d) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 10.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which, including those received via facsimile
transmission or email, shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.

Section 10.12. Headings. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

Section 10.13. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If
any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or
any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 10.14. Currency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all
payments required to be made hereunder, or as a result of a breach or
violation hereof, shall be made in Dollars, and, when any amount is paid with
respect to the foregoing such amount shall be the Dollar amount thereof on the
applicable date of funding regardless of the amount or type of 

currency necessary to be exchanged or converted in order to satisfy, pay or
fund such amount in Dollars.

Section 10.15. Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence for each and
every provision of this Agreement. Whenever the last day for the exercise of
any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day
which is not a Business Day, the party having such privilege or duty may
exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day
which is a regular Business Day.
