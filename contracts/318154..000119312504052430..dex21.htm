ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL
and the LLC Act, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub at

1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article 7 (excluding
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent provided by Law) waiver of
those conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its
terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto (the actual date of the Closing being referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Latham and
Watkins LLP, 633 West Fifth Street, Suite 4000, Los Angeles, California

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and LLC Act and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL and LLC Act. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, or at such other time as Parent and the
Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time
the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").



1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL and LLC Act.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time,
except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges,

Entity.

to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Formation of the Surviving
Entity until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by the LLC
Act or by applicable Law.



(b) The Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Merger Sub, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Limited Liability
Company Operating Agreement of the Surviving Entity until thereafter changed
or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.



1.5 _Managing Board/Officers_

.

(a) The members of the Board of Managers of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the members of the managing board of the Surviving
Entity until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The
directors of the Company shall resign effective as of the Effective Time.



 

2 (b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Entity until the earlier of their

and qualified, as the case may be.



ARTICLE 2

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF

THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



   2.1 | _Conversion of Securities_. 
---|--- 



(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities:



(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(ii)), shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio, except that cash shall be paid in lieu of issuing
any fractional shares of Company Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.2(e)
(such shares and cash, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time,
each share of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.



(ii) _Cancellation of Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub, or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub, or the Company as treasury stock, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 



(iii) _Merger Sub_. The issued and outstanding limited liability company
interests of Merger Sub shall remain issued and outstanding and shall
constitute the only issued and outstanding equity interests of the Surviving
Entity.



(b) _Change in Shares_. In the event that the Company changes the number of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, or Parent
changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares
of



 

3 Company Common Stock or shares of Parent Common Stock, as the case may be),
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication with respect to any such event, as Parent and the Company
shall mutually agree (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) so as to preserve the economic benefits that Parent and the Company
reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as a result of
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



(c) _Associated Rights_.



(i) References in this Agreement to Parent Common Stock shall include, unless
the context requires otherwise, the associated preferred share purchase rights
issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement dated as of
December 12, 2000 between Parent and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as Rights Agent (the " _Parent Rights Agreement_ ").



(ii) References in this Agreement to Company Common Stock shall include,
unless the context requires otherwise, the associated preferred share purchase
rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of December 11, 2002
between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, N.A., as Rights Agent, as
amended (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ ").



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or
another bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory
to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Article 2 through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the
number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held by holders of record
other than Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Parent agrees to provide
to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, immediately available
funds sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c).
Any cash and certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the
Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid per share of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by
Sections 2.2(c) and 2.2(e) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate,
other than Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub, (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent,



 

4 which letter shall be in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(a)(i) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then
held by such holder) and/or (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash that
such holder has the right to receive with respect to cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c). No interest
will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or
Section 2.2(e). In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or
more shares of Parent Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), may be issued with respect to such
Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such
shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Section 2.2(b), accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent
Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock, with a record date after
the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid
to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), unless and until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with Section
2.2(b). Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash
payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.



(d) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration
delivered upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or Section 2.2(e))
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.



(e) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, or book-entry credit of the same, shall
be issued upon the



 

5 surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with
respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
fractional share and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional share of Parent Common Stock, each holder of Company Common Stock
otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
entitled to receive from the Exchange Agent a cash payment in an amount equal
to the product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the Parent Closing Price.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and, from
and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock who
have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e)),
and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case, without
any interest thereon.



(g) _No Liability_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity, the
Exchange Agent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock for any such shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.



(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate (including any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(e)), and any dividends or other distributions to which
the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case,
without any interest thereon.



(i) _Withholding_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.



(j) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent upon termination of the



 

6 Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.2(f). In the event the cash in the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment
obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly
deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
payment obligations.



2.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise
provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, for any reason, in accordance with
Section 2.2(b), shall be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e))
and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c), in each case without any interest
thereon.



2.4 _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each unexercised and unexpired
Company Option then outstanding under any Company Stock Option Plan or
otherwise, whether or not then exercisable, shall be converted into an option
to purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.4;
_provided, however_ , that with respect to any such Company Options granted
under the Companys Rules of Approved Executive Share Option Sub-Scheme and
the Companys Rules of Unapproved Share Option Sub-Scheme For Employees (the
" _UK Stock Option Plans_ "), (i) Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the holders of such Company Options to
such conversion and (ii) each such Company Option so converted shall satisfy
the requirements set forth in the UK Stock Option Plans applicable to such
conversion; _provided, further_ that to the extent any Company Options have
been issued pursuant to agreements that have not been documented in writing,
or that have been documented but not provided to Parent, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents of the holders of such
Company Options to such conversion;  _provided, further_ that the Company and
Parent agree to cooperate to restructure such conversion of Company Options
held by holders who are not United States residents to the extent necessary or
desirable in order to accommodate local legal or tax considerations. Each
Company Option so converted shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting schedule) as set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Option Plan and any agreements thereunder (or if issued other than
pursuant to a Company Stock Option Plan, pursuant to the agreement that
governs its issuance) immediately prior to the Effective Time and, to the
extent allowable under applicable Law and the terms of the Company Stock
Option Plan (or such other agreement), the terms and conditions of (i) the
Employment Agreements, (ii) the executive transition assistance plan
(substantially in the form provided to the Company by Parent on the date
hereof), (iii) the employee transition assistance plan (substantially
consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the term sheet delivered
to the Company by Parent on the date hereof) that Parent will adopt prior to
the Effective Time (together, the " _Transition Assistance Plans_ ") and (iv)
_Schedule C_ , except that (x) each Company Option shall be exercisable (or
shall become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the 



 

7 number of shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
(y) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option so converted shall be equal to
the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. The conversion of any Company Options which are "incentive stock
options," within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, into options to
purchase Parent Common Stock shall be made so as not to constitute a
"modification" of such Company Options within the meaning of Section 424 of
the Code. Continuous employment with the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of
all converted Company Options after the Effective Time. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall assume each Company Stock Option Plan and the number
and kind of shares available for issuance under each such Company Stock Option
Plan shall be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
the provisions of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan.



2.5 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all requisite
action with respect to the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended (the " _ESPP_ "), to ensure that (i) with respect to any offering
period(s) commencing on or after the date of this Agreement, no participant in
the ESPP increases his or her rate of payroll deductions, and (ii) as of the
Effective Time, the ESPP is terminated, and that rights of participants
pursuant to the ESPP cease to represent any claim on the equity of the
Company. The Company shall deliver to Parent prior to Closing sufficient
evidence that the ESPP has been terminated pursuant to a resolution of the
Board of Directors of the Company (the form and substance of such resolution
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The rights of participants in the ESPP with respect to
any offering period(s) then underway under the ESPP, that commence prior to
the Effective Time, shall be determined by treating the last business day
prior to the Effective Time as the last day of any such offering period(s) and
by making such other pro-rata adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the
shortened offering period(s) but otherwise treating such shortened offering
period(s) as a fully effective and completed offering period(s) for all
purchases under the ESPP. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the ESPP and the
terms of any offering period(s) commencing prior to the Effective Time) that
are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.5 and to provide that, as of the Effective Time, participants and former
participants in the ESPP shall cease to have any right or interest thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all actions taken and all adjustments made
pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be taken or made in compliance with
Sections 423 and 424 of the Code and so as not to result in a "modification"
under such Sections.



2.6 _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each unexercised and unexpired
Company Warrant then outstanding shall be converted into a warrant
to purchase Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.6. Each
Company Warrant so converted shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as set forth in the agreement relating to such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each
Company Warrant shall be exercisable (or shall become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the



 

8 product of the number of shares that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) the per share purchase price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant so converted
shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Warrant was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. Except for Company Warrants that terminate pursuant
to their terms as of the Effective Time, prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents to ensure that holders of Company Warrants will have no rights other
than the right to receive the consideration provided for in this Section 2.6
from and after the Effective Time.

standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such

have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

or affected, except which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (iii)
except as listed in Section 3.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, require
any consent or approval under, result in any breach of, any loss of any
benefit under or constitute a change of control or default (or an event which

cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to any Company Material
Contract or Company Permit.

Act, any applicable Blue Sky Law, the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, the

filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL

Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all authorizations, licenses,
permits, certificates, approvals and clearances, and has submitted notices to,
all Governmental Entities (including all authorizations under the Federal

Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties or other assets and to
carry on its respective business in substantially the manner described in the
Company SEC Filings filed prior to the date hereof and as it is being
conducted as of the date hereof (the " _Company Permits_ "), and all such
Company Permits are valid, and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, or failure to be valid
or in full force and effect of, any of the Company Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (ii) any Company

13 Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed, contain

later-filed Company SEC Filing, or has otherwise become immaterial, none of
the Company SEC Filings contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in

indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and each
presented fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company, the consolidated Company Subsidiaries and
Cumbre as of the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end adjustments which did not and would not, individually or in the

and are being, maintained in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable
legal and accounting requirements.

incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 2003 that are not material to the business of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (ii) liabilities and obligations
incurred in connection with the Companys performance of its obligations under
this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.



(d) The Company has previously provided to Parent a complete and correct copy

investigation before any Governmental Entity, charge or lawsuit. To the
Companys knowledge, as of the date hereof, no employees of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary are in any material respect in violation of any term of
any employment Contract, non-disclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement,
or any restrictive covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any

provisions. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or other
related agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event,
such as termination of employment), except as provided by Parent (i) result

employee, consultant or vendor is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of
confidential information of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. To the
knowledge of the Company, none of the employees, consultants or vendors of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in violation of such agreements.



(m) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not result in or
give rise to (i) any right of termination or other right to impair or limit
any of the Companys rights to own or retain a license to any of the Owned
Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property used in, and material
to, the ordinary day-to-day conduct of business of the Company and any
Company Subsidiary, taken as a whole, or (ii) the inability (for any period
of time) of the Company to transfer such rights to Parent or the Surviving
Entity pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.



3.17 _Supply Arrangements_. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts or circumstances that have materially adversely affected or are
reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the continued supply (either
for clinical purposes or in bulk) of the active ingredients of the compounds,

currently used in clinical trials.



3.18 _Taxes_.



(a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has duly and timely filed
with the appropriate tax authorities or other Governmental Entities all Tax
Returns that it was required to file prior to the date that such Tax Return
became delinquent. All such Tax Returns are complete and accurate. All Taxes
due and owing by any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on or before
the date hereof (whether or not shown as being due on any Tax Returns) have
been paid. None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary currently is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No
claim has ever been made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction, and to the Companys knowledge,
there are no facts or basis upon which any such claim could reasonably be
made.



(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries did not, as
of the dates of the financial statements contained in the most recent Company
SEC Filings, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any notes
thereto) contained in such financial statements. Since the date of the
financial statements in the most recent Company SEC Filings, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any liability for Taxes
outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise inconsistent with past
custom and practice.



(c) No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or assessed by a Tax
authority or other Governmental Entity. No audit or other proceeding for or
relating to any liability in respect of



 

27 Taxes of any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is being or has ever
been conducted by any Tax authority or Governmental Entity, and the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have not received notification in writing that
any such audit or other proceeding is pending. Each deficiency resulting from
any completed audit or examination relating to Taxes by any Tax authority has
been timely paid or is being contested in good faith and has been adequately
reserved for on the books of the Company. No issues relating to any material
amount of Taxes were raised by the relevant Tax authority in any completed
audit or examination that would reasonably be expected to recur in a later
taxable period. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete
and accurate copies of federal, state and local income Tax Returns of each of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and promptly upon their
availability, 2003, and complete and accurate copies of all examination
reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by any
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessors since December
31, 1999, with respect to Taxes of any type. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries nor any predecessor has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any request been made in
writing for any such extension or waiver.



(d) There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of any of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries (other than with respect to Permitted Liens for
Taxes). No power of attorney (other than powers of attorney authorizing
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to act on behalf of the
Company or such Company Subsidiaries, respectively) with respect to any Taxes
has been executed or filed with any Tax authority.



(e) All Taxes required to be withheld, collected or deposited by or with
respect to the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been timely
withheld, collected or deposited as the case may be, and to the extent
required, have been paid to the relevant Tax authority or other Governmental
Entity.



(f) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is responsible for the
Taxes of any other Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee, by
Contract, or otherwise. None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to, is bound by or has any obligation under any Tax sharing, Tax
allocation or Tax indemnity agreement or similar Contract or arrangement.

presented fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of Parent as of the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which did not and
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect).

company interests of Merger Sub are owned directly by Parent. There are no
options, warrants or other rights (including registration rights), agreements,
arrangements or commitments to which Merger Sub is a party of any character
relating to the issued or unissued Equity Interests in Merger Sub or
obligating Merger Sub to grant, issue or sell any Equity Interests in Merger
Sub, by sale, lease, license or otherwise. There are no obligations,
contingent or otherwise, of Merger Sub to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Equity Interests of Merger Sub.

Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its and its Affiliates
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
confidentiality agreement, dated February 11, 2003, as amended by an
amendment letter dated May 21, 2003, previously executed by the Company and
Parent, as further amended to date (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). This
Agreement hereby amends the Confidentiality Agreement to provide that the
prohibitions, restrictions and other terms and conditions contained in Section
6 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply to this Agreement, the
Voting Agreement, the Employment Agreements, the Affiliate Agreements and
any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein.



6.4 _No Solicitation of Transactions_.



(a) The Company agrees it shall not, and it shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or induce or knowingly or
intentionally facilitate or encourage any inquiry with respect to, or the
making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish to any Person any information with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to
Section 6.4(c)(i)), (iii) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with any Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify
such Person as to the existence of these provisions, or to the extent
specifically permitted pursuant to Section 6.4(c)(ii), (iv) approve, endorse
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (except to the extent specifically
permitted pursuant to Section 6.4(e)), or (v) enter into any letter of intent
or similar document or any agreement, commitment or understanding
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or a
transaction contemplated thereby (except for confidentiality agreements
specifically permitted pursuant to Section 6.4(c)(i)). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be a breach of this
Section 6.4(a) by the Company. The Company shall and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary and its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives to
immediately terminate all discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third
party with respect to, or any that would reasonably be expected to lead to or
contemplate the possibility of, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight hours following the execution
of this Agreement) demand that each Person which has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives with respect to such
Persons consideration of a possible Acquisition Proposal (other than
agreements that have expired by their terms) to immediately return or destroy
(which destruction shall be certified in writing by such Person to the
Company) all confidential information heretofore furnished by the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any of its or their Affiliates or Representatives to
such Person, its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Affiliates or
Representatives. The parties agree that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub
be deemed an Affiliate of the Company for purposes of this Section 6.4(a).
Section 6.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list of
any confidentiality agreement with the



 

47 Company or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or any of its or their
Representatives with respect to such Persons consideration of a possible
Acquisition Proposal (other than agreements that have expired by their terms).



(b) (i) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within twenty-four hours,
after any officer or director of the Company receives or has knowledge of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and a written summary of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if it is not in writing. After
receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, the Company shall
continue to promptly keep Parent informed in all material respects of the
status and details (including notice of all material amendments or proposed
material amendments and a summary of all oral proposals, requests or
inquiries) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and shall
promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials subsequently
provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.



(ii) The Company shall provide Parent with five Business Days prior notice (or
such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of the Board
of Directors of the Company) of any meeting of the Board of Directors of the
Company at which such Board of Directors is reasonably expected to discuss any
Acquisition Proposal or Change of Recommendation described in Section
6.4(e)(B).



(c) If, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Person that
is a Superior Proposal (and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after
taking into account any modifications to this Agreement proposed by Parent and
Merger Sub during any five Business Day period referenced below), the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent written notice that shall state expressly (A)
that it has received a Superior Proposal and (B) the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (the " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") and may, so long as the
Superior Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the
date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 6.4,
take the following actions (but only if and to the extent that Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, following the receipt of
advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable
Law):



(i) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal, provided that (A) prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such Person, (1) the Company gives Parent written
notice of its intention to furnish nonpublic information and (2) the Company
receives from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such Person on its behalf and customary
standstill provisions, the terms of which are no more favorable to such Person
than the terms contained in



 

48 the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any
such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes to Parent
all such nonpublic information not previously provided to Parent and a
detailed list of all such non-public information previously provided to
Parent; and



(ii) engage in discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to
the Acquisition Proposal.



(d) For a period of not less than five Business Days after Parents receipt
of each Superior Proposal Notice, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,
negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal (a " _Former Superior Proposal_ "). The terms
and conditions of this Section 6.4 shall again apply to any inquiry or
proposal made by any Person who withdraws a Superior Proposal or who made a
Former Superior Proposal (after withdrawal or after such time as their
proposal is a Former Superior Proposal).



(e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
Company Recommendation or (ii) recommend, adopt or approve or propose publicly
to recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, (A) other than in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company
may withhold, withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation, and (B) in
response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn
and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after the Companys compliance
with Section 6.4(b), Section 6.4(c) and Section 6.4(d), the Board of Directors
of the Company may withhold or withdraw the Company Recommendation and may
recommend the Superior Proposal (any of the actions under the foregoing (A) or
(B), whether by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof,
a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), if, in the case of (A) or (B), both of the
following conditions are met:



(i) the Company Stockholders Meeting has not occurred; and



(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith,
following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure
of the Board of Directors of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation
would result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys
stockholders on this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders
Meeting shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement,
disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by any Change of Recommendation. The
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or propose to do
so.



 

49 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) accurate disclosure of factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal, in each case, to
the extent such information, facts, identity or terms are required to be
disclosed under applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree
or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 6.4(e).



6.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to
cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable,
(ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents
and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity and thereafter make any other required submissions, with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities
Laws, (B) the HSR Act and antitrust and competition Laws of any other
applicable jurisdiction and (C) any other applicable Law and (iii) the
obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties;
_provided_ that none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be required to
make any payment to any such third parties or concede anything of value to
obtain such consents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not,
without Parents prior written consent, commit or agree to commit to any
divestitures or licenses or agree to hold separate any assets or agree to any
similar arrangements or commit to conduct its business in a specified manner
(or allow any Company Subsidiary to commit to any divestitures or licenses or
agree to hold separate any assets or agree to any similar arrangements).
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary to (with respect to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or with respect
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary) commit to any divestitures or
licenses or agree to hold separate any assets or agree to any similar
arrangements or commit to conduct its business in a specified manner, whether
as a condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental Entity or any
other Person or for any other reason.



(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall duly file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, and in any applicable foreign
jurisdiction with the appropriate Governmental Entity, the notification and
report form required under the HSR Act or the antitrust and competition Laws
of any such foreign jurisdiction (the _"Antitrust Filing_ ") with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.
The



 

50 Antitrust Filing shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of
applicable Laws. In connection with the Antitrust Filing, each party shall
(i) cooperate with the other party to the extent necessary to assist the other
party in the preparation of its Antitrust Filing and pursuant to any
investigation or other inquiry under or relating to applicable Laws, (ii)
keep the other party informed of any communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) permit the other party to review in advance any communication
intended to be given by it to, and consult with the other party in advance of
any meeting or conference with, any Governmental Entity, (iv) to request
early termination of the waiting period required by any applicable Laws and
(v) if requested, to promptly amend or furnish additional information
thereunder.



(c) The Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall (i) take
all action possible to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if
any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



(d) (i) Subject to, but without limiting the foregoing sections (a), (b) and
(c), Parent and the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or
judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the
Outside Date including defending through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court by any Person; and (ii) each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date).



(e) Subject to Section 6.5(a), the Company and Parent shall give (or
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third
parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents, (i) necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
(ii) required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or (iii)
required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to
or after the Effective Time or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from
occurring after the Effective Time. In the event that either party shall fail
to obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this
Section 6.5(e), such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts,
and shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party
hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their
respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which
would reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the
failure to obtain such consent.



 

51 (f) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened action, suit, arbitration or other proceeding or
investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other Person (i) challenging
or seeking damages in connection with the Merger or the conversion of Company
Common Stock into Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger or (ii) seeking
to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or otherwise limit the
right of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to own or operate all or any portion
of the businesses or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.



6.6 _Letters of Company s Accountants_. At the request of Parent, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to
Parent a comfort letter of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys
independent public accountants, dated a date within two (2) business days
before the Registration Statement shall become effective and a comfort letter
of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP dated a date within two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date, each addressed to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.



6.7 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be likely to
cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied or
(b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected
to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.7 shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty, the failure to comply with any covenant, the failure to meet any
condition or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.



6.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
make reasonable comment upon, any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with NASDAQ, will not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of Parent and the Company may make any public statement in response to
specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending
industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any
such statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do
not reveal nonpublic information regarding the other party.



6.9 _NASDAQ Listing_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
(a) to cause the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing upon the Effective Time on NASDAQ or on such national securities
exchange as the Parent Common



 

52 Stock is listed and (b) to cause the Parent Common Stock issued upon the
exercise of converted Company Options and Company Warrants to be approved for
listing on NASDAQ or on such national securities exchange as Parent Common
Stock is listed.



6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_.



(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Merger Sub and its other Subsidiaries to
assume and comply with the terms of all Company Benefit Plans and
the Transition Assistance Plans and to pay or provide, or cause to be paid or
provided, the benefits required thereunder, except that there shall be no
obligation of Parent to continue to provide benefits under the Company Benefit
Plans, other than as provided in the Employment Agreements and Transition
Assistance Plans, in respect of periods following the Effective Time and
nothing herein shall prevent Parent from terminating any of the Company
Benefit Plans unless prohibited by their terms or the terms of the Employment
Agreements or Transition Assistance Plans. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as requiring Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to continue any
specific employee benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement
sponsored or maintained by Parent as of the date of this Agreement or to
continue the employment of any specific individual, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or pursuant to the Employment Agreements or the
Transition Assistance Plans, or to restrict any changes that Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries may make to any employee benefit plan, program, practice,
policy or arrangement sponsored or maintained by Parent as of the date of this
Agreement or Company Benefit Plan as are permitted by its terms and under any
applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not modify or amend
the Transition Assistance Plans to the extent such modification or amendment
would materially reduce the benefits, if any, payable to the participants
thereunder.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (the " _Benefits Date_
"), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to employees of the Company
"employee welfare benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and
"employee pension benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA that are
substantially similar in the aggregate, as reasonably determined by Parent, to
those made generally available to similarly situated employees of Parent who
are hired by Parent after December 31, 2003. From the Effective Time to the
Benefits Date (which the parties acknowledge may occur on different dates with
respect to different plans, programs or arrangements of the Company) (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided,
"employee welfare benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA and
"employee pension benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA that are
substantially similar in the aggregate, as reasonably determined by Parent,
to those provided to employees of the Company as of the date hereof.



(c) With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or
arrangement maintained by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent in which employees
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries subsequently participate (the "
_Parent Plans_ "), for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), service with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary (or predecessor employers to the extent the
Company or a Company Subsidiary provides past service credit) shall be treated
as service with Parent; provided, that such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that such recognition would result in a



 

53 duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized
under the applicable Company Benefit Plan. As of the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity and its other Subsidiaries to,
credit to employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries the amount of
vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company
Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time, subject to the cap on vacation accrual
set forth in Parents vacation policy, provided that the accrued vacation time
of each such employee in excess of such cap shall be paid as soon
as practicable to such employee at the employees compensation rate in effect
as of the Effective Time. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be
waived any waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the
application of any pre existing condition limitations under any Parent Plans.
Employees of the Company or a Company Subsidiary shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a similar Company Benefit Plan during the plan year that
includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out of pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs.



(d) If requested by Parent at least five (5) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than
the day immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent
requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time.



(e) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee of the Company, any beneficiary or dependent thereof,
or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any employee of the Company by Parent or the Surviving Entity or
under any benefit plan which Parent or the Surviving Entity may maintain. 



(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Companys
2004 Incentive Plan adopted and approved by its board of directors on February
12, 2004 (the " _2004 Incentive Plan_ "), and Parent shall not assume any
obligations under the 2004 Incentive Plan. The Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that the 2004 Incentive Plan has been terminated pursuant to
resolution of the Companys board of directors (the form and substance of
which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) no later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time.



(g) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that none of the Merger
Consideration is consideration for services or allocable to any covenant not
to compete or to any other employment arrangement between the parties.



(h) To the extent that any Company Common Stock to be converted into
shares of Parent Common Stock by virtue of the Merger is pledged to the
Company as security for any loans to any employee of the Company, the Company
shall cooperate with



 

54 Parent to secure a pledge agreement relating to such Parent Common Stock from
such employee, on substantially similar terms as the pledge agreement between
such employee and the Company as in existence as of the date hereof.



6.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.



(a) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, (i) to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law and (ii) without limiting the obligations
under clause (i), but only to the extent permitted under applicable Law, as
required pursuant to any indemnity agreements of the Company (and Parent also
shall advance attorneys fees and expenses as incurred; _provided,_ that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, settlements,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
hereby) and such obligation shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years from and after the Effective Time.



(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, or transferee
of such assets shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.11.



(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Entity to, maintain (directly or indirectly through the Companys existing
insurance programs), in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (a complete and accurate
copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent), on terms with respect
to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof (provided that, such terms are commercially
available in the market); _provided, however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute
therefor policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage
(including as coverage relates to deductibles and exclusions) and amount no
less favorable to such directors and officers or (ii) obtain such extended
reporting period coverage under the Companys existing insurance programs (to
be effective as of the Effective Time) and the Company shall cooperate with
Parent in doing so (including, without limitation, executing all documents and
providing all information and materials reasonably necessary therefor);
_provided further_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this Section
6.11(c), neither the Company nor Parent shall be obligated to pay more than
200% of the last annual aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement by the Company in the aggregate to obtain such coverage. It is
understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for
200% of the last annual aggregate premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement by the Company, or less, in



 

55 the aggregate, Parent shall be obligated to provide the greatest coverage as
may be obtained for such aggregate amount. 



(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(e) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for
the benefit of each indemnified party of this Section 6.11, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives. The obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Entity under this Section 6.11 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section
6.11 applies without the express written consent of such affected indemnitee.



6.12 _Affiliate Letters_. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent the
identity of any Persons that are expected to become "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and who have not
executed an Affiliate Agreement. The Company shall furnish such information
and documents as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing
the list. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Person who is identified as an affiliate in the list furnished or
supplemented pursuant to this Section 6.12 to execute an Affiliate Agreement,
as soon as practicable after the date such Person is included on the list.



6.13 _Stock Award Matters_.



(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the administrator(s) of each of the
Company Stock Option Plans to, take any and all actions necessary to cause
the Company Options outstanding under the Company Stock Option Plans to be
converted into options to purchase Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4
in such manner as will not result in acceleration or termination of such
Company Options under such Company Stock Option Plans. Each of Parent and the
Company agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions
reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of the Transition Assistance
Plans and _Schedule C_.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more
registration statements on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
other successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to options issued or assumed pursuant to Section
2.4 and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain
outstanding.



6.14 _Stockholder Litigation_.



(a) In the event a stockholder litigation related to this Agreement, the
Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
brought, or threatened, against the Company and/or the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company, the Company shall have the right to control the
defense of such litigation; _provided, however,_ that (i) any fees, costs or
expenses incurred related to defending such litigation shall be reasonable
(including attorneys fees), and (ii) the Company shall engage
counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent of any such stockholder litigation brought, or threatened, against the
Company and/or the members of the Board of



 

56 Directors of the Company and shall provide Parent with updates and such
information as Parent shall reasonably request with respect to the status of
the litigation and discussions between the parties thereto. The Company shall
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of and settlement
discussions with respect to such litigation and shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or

deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation".

parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and
oral, between the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole
or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior

the items so included or other items, are or are not material, and neither
party shall use the fact of setting of such amounts or the fact of
the inclusion of such item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any dispute or
controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
is or is not material for purposes hereof.



9.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_  

.

(a) This Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and all disputes

otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to the application of Delaware
principles of conflicts of laws.



(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Delaware State court, or Federal court of the United States of America,
sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby



 

76 or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) agrees not to

any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by Law,
in such Federal court, (c) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court, and (d) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be

or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.



(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
9.12.



9.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not to
be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any
other remedies at Law or in equity.



9.14 _Disclosure_. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein
unless the Company Disclosure Letter identifies the exception and describes
the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or
other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty
has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly understood and acknowledged
that any information disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter under any
numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and qualify
representations and warranties set forth in one or more other parts of
the Company Disclosure Letter, but only where



 

77 the relevance of such disclosure to such other part or parts is reasonably
apparent from the text of such disclosure;  _provided,_ that information
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall provide an exception to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.18 only to the extent
the Company Disclosure Letter specifically identifies each exception by
specific reference to Section 3.18. The provision of monetary or other
quantitative thresholds for disclosure does not and shall not be deemed to
create or imply a standard of materiality hereunder.



9.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

AFFILIATE LETTER



March , 2004



Amgen Inc.

One Amgen Center Drive

 

Thousand Oaks, California 91320-1799



Ladies and Gentlemen:



The undersigned has been advised that, as of the date of this letter, the
undersigned may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Tularik Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Tularik"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") of the rules and regulations
(the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March
28, 2004 (the "Agreement") by and among Tularik, Amgen Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Amgen"), and Arrow Acquisition, LLC, a limited liability company
("Merger Sub"), Tularik will be merged with Merger Sub (the "Merger").



As a result of the Merger, the undersigned will receive shares of
common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of Amgen ("Amgen Common Stock") in
exchange for shares owned by the undersigned of common stock, par value $.001
per share, of Tularik ("Tularik Common Stock").



The undersigned represents, covenants and warrants to, and agrees with,
Amgen as set forth below and recognizes that Tularik, Amgen and the Surviving
Entity (as defined in the Agreement) will rely upon this letter in
consummating the Merger.



1\. _Compliance with the Act_. The undersigned represents, warrants and
covenants that:



(a) The undersigned shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of
Amgen Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



(b) The undersigned has carefully read this letter and discussed its
requirements and other applicable limitations upon the undersigneds ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Amgen Common Stock, to the extent
the undersigned felt necessary, with the undersigneds counsel or counsel for
Tularik.



(c) The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of Amgen Common Stock
to the undersigned pursuant to the Agreement will be registered with the
Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, the
undersigned has also been advised that, because the undersigned may be
deemed to have been an affiliate of Tularik at the time the Merger was
submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Tularik, and the distribution by
the undersigned of Amgen Common Stock has not been registered under the Act,
the undersigned may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Amgen Common
Stock issued to the undersigned in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under
the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity
with Rule 145, or (iii) in the opinion of outside counsel, which opinion and
outside counsel are reasonably acceptable to Amgen, or pursuant to a "no
action" or interpretative letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff
of the Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise
exempt from registration under the Act.



(d) The undersigned understands that Rule 145 permits offers, sales and
transfers only in limited amounts and in limited circumstances, many of which
will be outside of the undersigneds control. The undersigned understands that
Amgen is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other
disposition of Amgen Common Stock by the undersigned or on the
undersigneds behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in
order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.



(e) In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition pursuant to Rule
145, the undersigned will supply Amgen with a letter in the form of Exhibit A
hereto evidencing compliance with such Rule and an opinion in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Amgen from outside counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Amgen to the effect that such sale, transfer or
other disposition is not in violation of the Act or the Rules and
Regulations. The undersigned understands that Amgen may instruct its transfer
agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Amgen Common Stock disposed of
by the undersigned, but that upon receipt of such letter the transfer agent
shall effectuate the transfer of such shares indicated as sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of in the letter.



(f) The undersigned also understands that there will be placed on the
certificates for Amgen Common Stock issued to the undersigned, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,
APPLIES AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT
TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."



(g) The undersigned also understands that unless the transfer by the
undersigned of the undersigneds Amgen Common Stock has been registered under
the Act or is a sale made in conformity with Rule 145, Amgen reserves the
right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to the
undersigneds transferee:



"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO
RECEIVED SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED



 

2 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN
ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH,
ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT
TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION
FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."



(h) It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (f)
and (g) above will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without
such legend if such legend is not required for purposes of the Act or this
letter agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that such legends and the stop orders referred to above will be removed if: 



(i) one year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired Amgen
Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are
then available to the undersigned;



(ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired Amgen
Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are
then available to the undersigned; or



(iii) Amgen has received either an opinion of outside counsel, which opinion
and outside counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to Amgen, or a "no
action" or interpretative letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff
of the Commission, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule 145 no
longer apply to the undersigned.



The obligations of the undersigned hereunder shall attach to and be binding
upon any person or entity to whom legal or beneficial ownership of
the undersigneds shares of Amgen Common Stock (and shares of Amgen Common
Stock following the Merger) shall pass by operation of law or otherwise.





 

3 The execution and delivery to you of this letter agreement shall not be deemed
an admission that the undersigned is an "affiliate" of Tularik as described
in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights the
undersigned may have to object to any claim that the undersigned is such an
affiliate on or after the date of this letter.



Very truly yours,

Agreed to and accepted

Cooley Godward LLP

Ladies and Gentlemen:



We refer to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of
March 28, 2004, by and among AMGEN, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), ARROW
ACQUISITION LLC, a Delaware limited liability company wholly-owned by
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and TULARIK, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
which provides for the merger (the "Merger") of the Company with and into
Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving entity (the "Surviving Entity"),
on the terms and conditions set forth therein. Parents receipt of an opinion
of Latham and Watkins LLP, and the Companys receipt of an opinion of Cooley
Godward LLP, in each case regarding certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Merger, are conditions to the closing of the Merger, as
provided in Section 7.2(f) and Section 7.3(c) of the Agreement, respectively.
The time at which the Merger becomes effective is hereinafter referred to as
the "Effective Time." Capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings
specified in the Agreement.



A. _Statements and Representations._



In connection with such opinions, and acknowledging that each of you will
rely, with Parents and Merger Subs consent, upon the statements and
representations made in this letter in rendering such opinion, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby certify and represent to each of you that the statements and
representations made herein as they relate to Parent and Merger Sub are true,
correct and complete in all respects at the date hereof and will be true,
correct and complete in all respects as of the Effective Time (as if made as
of the Effective Time):



1\. The fair market value of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock received by holders of Company Common
Stock ("Company Stockholders") other than Parent will be approximately equal
to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered by such Company Stockholders in the Merger.
In connection with the Merger, no Company Stockholder will receive in
exchange for Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration
from Parent (or Merger Sub) other than Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.



2\. Except with respect to open market purchases of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Parents pre-existing general stock repurchase program that
has not been created or modified in connection with the Merger (other than to
increase the authorized number of shares to enable Parent to reacquire on the
open market from unidentified sellers a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock approximately equal to the number issued in the Merger), following the
Merger, neither Parent nor any person related to Parent within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) has any plan or
intention to purchase, redeem or otherwise reacquire any Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Agreement.



 

3\. Parent has no plan or intention: (i) to merge the Surviving Entity into
another entity; (ii) to sell or otherwise dispose of any membership interests
in the Surviving Entity held by Parent, or (iii) to sell or otherwise dispose
of, or to cause the Surviving Entity to sell or otherwise dispose of, any of
Merger Subs assets or any of the assets of the Company acquired in the
Merger, except that Parent may (w) make dispositions made in the ordinary
course of business, (x) make transfers described in Section 368(a)(2)(C) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or in the
applicable Treasury Regulations, (y) effect a merger of the Surviving Entity
into Parent, or (z) make occasional sales of the Surviving Entitys assets for
fair market value that do not prevent the continuation of the Companys
"historic business" or use of "historic business assets" as described in
paragraph 7 below.



4\. At all times since its formation, Merger Sub has been an entity wholly-
owned directly by Parent and has been disregarded as separate from Parent for
federal tax purposes. No Form 8832 has ever been filed with respect to Merger
Sub to treat Merger Sub as other than a disregarded entity.



5\. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity will be an
entity wholly-owned directly by Parent and will be disregarded as separate
from Parent for federal tax purposes. Other than a possible merger of the
Surviving Entity into Parent, Parent has no plan or intention to take any
action or to cause or allow the Surviving Entity to take any action, after the
Effective Time, that would result in the Surviving Entity ceasing to be an
entity wholly-owned by Parent that is disregarded as separate from Parent for
federal tax purposes.



6\. Except with respect to Parents ownership of approximately 21.0% of the
Company Common Stock and except pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, as
of the Effective Time, neither Parent nor any person related to Parent within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5)
will own beneficially or of record, or will have owned beneficially or of
record during the five years immediately prior to the Effective Time, any
stock of the Company, or other securities, options, warrants or instruments
giving the holder thereof the right to acquire Company Common Stock or other
securities offered by the Company.



 

2 7\. Assuming the accuracy of paragraph 5 in the Company Representation Letter,
following the Merger, Parent or the Surviving Entity (or a member or members
of the "qualified group," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii), that includes Parent as the "issuing corporation," as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(b)), will continue the
"historic business" of the Company (or, alternatively, if the Company has more
than one line of business, will continue at least one significant line of the
Companys "historic business") or use a "significant portion" (at least 33
1/3 percent by value) of the Companys "historic business assets" in a
business (all within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-1(d)).
For purposes of this representation, Parent will be treated as owning its
proportionate share of the Companys business assets used in a business of any
partnership in which members of Parents qualified group either own a
significant interest or have active and substantial management functions as a
partner with respect to that partnership business.



8\. Except as provided in Sections 8.2 and 8.5 of the Agreement, each of
Parent and Merger Sub has paid and will pay only its respective expenses, if
any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has agreed to assume, nor will either directly or indirectly assume, any
expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any Company
Stockholder.



9\. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
the Company or between Merger Sub and the Company that was issued, acquired,
or will be settled at a discount.



10\. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an "investment company" as defined in
Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.



11\. The issuance in the Merger of cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the
purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing
fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for
consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in lieu of
issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed [one] percent
([1]%) of the total consideration that will be issued pursuant to the
Agreement to the Stockholders in exchange for their Company Common Stock. The
fractional share interests of each Company Stockholder will be aggregated, and
no Company Stockholder, with the possible exception of Company Stockholders
whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers, will
receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share
of Parent Common Stock valued at the Parent Closing Price.



12\. None of the compensation received by any stockholder-employees of the
Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of the
Company Common Stock held by such stockholder-employee. None of the Parent
Common Stock received by any stockholder-employees will be consideration for
services or allocable to any employment arrangement. The compensation paid to
any stockholder-employees by Parent or by the Surviving Entity following the
Merger will be for services actually rendered and will be



 

3 commensurate with amounts that would be paid to third parties bargaining at
arms-length for similar services. 



13\. Merger Sub is an entity newly formed for the purpose of participating in
the Merger, and at no time prior to the Effective Time has had assets (other
than nominal assets contributed upon the formation of Merger Sub, which assets
will be held by the Surviving Entity following the Merger) or
business operations.



14\. In the Merger, Merger Sub will acquire all of the assets and liabilities
of the Company, and the Company will cease its separate legal existence for
all purposes.



15\. Parent has a _bona fide_ business reason for engaging in the Merger.



16\. The fair market value of the Companys assets that will be transferred to
Merger Sub in the Merger will equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities that
will be assumed by Merger Sub plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which
the transferred assets will be subject.



17\. The terms of the Agreement and all other agreements entered into in
connection therewith are the product of arms length negotiations. 



18\. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the terms of the
Agreement, none of the material terms and conditions therein has been waived
or modified, and Parent has no plan or intention to waive or modify any such
terms or conditions.



19\. Following the Merger, Parent and the Surviving Entity will comply with
the record-keeping and filing requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-3.



20\. Parent and Merger Sub are not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



 

21\. The undersigned are authorized to make all of the representations set
forth herein.



B. _Reliance by You in Rendering Opinion: Limitations on Your Opinion._



The undersigned recognize and agree that your tax opinion will be based (i) on
the statements and representations set forth herein, (ii) on the statements
contained in the Agreement and documents related thereto (including, but not
limited to, the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement), and (iii) on the
consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Agreement. The undersigned also recognize and agree that, with respect to each
of you, your tax opinion will be subject to certain limitations and
qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if any such
statements or representations are not accurate in all respects.



 

4 Each of Parent and Merger Sub undertake to inform you immediately should any
of the foregoing statements or representations become untrue, incorrect or
incomplete in any respect on or prior to the Effective Time.

complete in all respects as of the Effective Time (as if made as of the
Effective Time):



1\. The fair market value of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock received by holders of Company Common
Stock ("Company Stockholders") other than Parent will be approximately equal
to the fair market value of the Company Common Stock surrendered by such Company Stockholders in the Merger.

fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.



2\. Any dispositions, in contemplation or as part of the Merger, of

5\. The business currently carried on by the Company is its "historic
