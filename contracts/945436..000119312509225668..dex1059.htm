Unitholders of any portion of Expense Escrow Amount or payment of the Earnout
Consideration) shall be made in the following priority, consistent with the
terms of the Operating Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time:

(i) First, such payments shall be made to the Preferred Unitholders, pro rata
based on the Allocable Percentage of each Preferred Unitholder, until the
Preferred Merger Payments equal the Preferred Units Preference Amount; and

(ii) Second, payments in respect of Net Merger Consideration in excess of the
Preferred Units Preference Amount, if any, shall be made to the Common
Unitholders and the Cashout UAR Holders (if applicable) pro rata based on the
Allocable Percentage of each Common Unitholder and each Cashout UAR Holder (if
applicable).



 

10 (c) _Effect of Distribution of Preferred Units Preference Amount_. For
purposes of clarity, the Parties acknowledge that the purpose of the
foregoing payment provisions in _Section 1.7(b)_ is to give effect to the
relative distribution preferences and priority of the Preferred Units pursuant
to the terms of the Operating Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The effect of this priority, when taken together with the fact
that a portion of the Merger Consideration is subject to indemnification and
expense escrow arrangements as well as the earnout, means that the Common
Unitholders and Cashout UAR Holders may not ultimately receive any payment of
Merger Consideration.

(d) _Stock Splits and Similar Events_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
connection with the Net Merger Consideration (including the Preferred
Unitholder Initial Stock Payment, the Indemnification Escrow Shares and the
stock portion of the Earnout Consideration) shall be adjusted proportionately
for any stock splits, subdivisions, reverse stock splits, combinations,
recapitalizations, dividends, distributions and the like.

(e) _Example_. Attached hereto as _Annex A_ is an illustrative example of
the calculation and payment of Merger Consideration pursuant to the foregoing
terms of this Agreement.

(f) _Withholding_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from each
Unitholders respective portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of United States federal, state or local, or any foreign, Tax Law.
Such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the applicable Unitholders in respect of which Parent made such
deduction and withholding.

1.8 _Election Mechanics_.

(a) _Common Unitholders_.

(i) _Generally_. Each Common Unitholder shall make, or be deemed to have made,
an election to receive all of its Common Merger Consideration (1) in shares of
Parent Common Stock (a " _Common Unitholder Stock Election_ ") or (2) in cash
(a " _Common Unitholder Cash Election_ ") in accordance with the provisions of
this _Section 1.8_.

(ii) _Election Form; Accredited Investor Questionnaire_. Promptly following
the date hereof, the Company shall mail (by U.S. Mail, reputable overnight
delivery service or to the email address of such Person in the Companys
possession) to each Person who was a Common Unitholder of record as of the
date hereof (1) a form, reasonably acceptable to Parent (" _Form of Election_
"), pursuant to which each Common Unitholder shall be entitled to elect to
receive all of its Common Merger Consideration in _either_ cash or shares of
Parent Common Stock and (2) an Accredited Investor Questionnaire, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent (an " _AIQ Form_ " and, together with the Form
of Election, the " _Election Materials_ "). The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly make available the Election Materials to any
holder of Common Units who requests such materials following the initial
mailing of the Election Materials and prior to the Election Deadline. In no
event shall the initial mailing of Election Materials to the Common
Unitholders be made less than five (5) days prior to the Election Deadline.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have the option to mail the
Election Materials in the same mailing as the Proxy Statement/Offering
Memorandum. 



 

11 (iii) _Election_.



     | (1) | To make a valid Common Unitholder Stock Election, a Common
Unitholder must deliver to the Company prior to the Election Deadline an
executed and properly completed (A) Form of Election making a Common
Unitholder Stock Election _and_ (B) an AIQ Form indicating that such Common
Unitholder is an Accredited Investor. For clarity, any Common Unitholder who
is not an Accredited Investor shall not be entitled to make a Common
Unitholder Stock Election and will receive his, her or its portion of the
Common Merger Consideration, if any, in cash. 
---|---|--- 



     | (2) | A Common Unitholder shall be deemed to have made a Common
Unitholder Cash Election if such Common Unitholder: 
---|---|--- 


     | a. | delivers to the Company prior to the Election Deadline an
executed and properly completed Form of Election making a Common Unitholder
Cash Election; or  
---|---|--- 



     | b. | does not deliver to the Company both (i) an executed and
properly completed Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline and (ii) an
AIQ Form indicating that such Common Unitholder is an Accredited Investor; or 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | otherwise has not satisfied the requirements of _Section
1.8(a)(iii)(1)_ to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company on or prior to
the Election Deadline.  
---|---|--- 

Any reasonable determination by the Company with respect to whether a Common
Unitholder has or has not made a valid Common Unitholder Stock Election shall
be final, binding and unappealable.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Agreement are intended to
provide that any Unitholder who has not executed and delivered an AIQ Form
indicating that he, she, or it is an Accredited Investor shall receive cash in
the Merger and not shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(iv) _Schedule Update_. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver (A) an updated Common Unitholder Schedule
to Parent and the Exchange Agent which schedule shall indicate each Common
Unitholders Common Unitholder Stock Election or Common Unitholder Cash
Election and (B) an updated Cashout UAR Holder Schedule to Parent and the
Exchange Agent which schedule shall indicate each Cashout UAR Holders portion
of the Common Unitholders Distributed Merger Consideration, if any.

(v) _Election Deadline_. Any election pursuant to this _Section 1.8(a)_ shall
have been made properly only if the Company shall have received, by the
Election Deadline, a Form of Election and AIQ Form with respect to any Common
Unitholder Stock Election properly completed and signed and reasonably
acceptable to the Company. As used herein, " _Election Deadline_ " means 9:00
a.m. Central time on the date of the Company Unitholder Meeting.



 

12 (b) _Elections Irrevocable_. All elections shall be irrevocable once made and
shall be binding on the Unitholder and any subsequent transferee of any
Units.

1.9 _Initial Preferred Unitholder Payment Mechanics_.

(a) Pursuant to an Exchange Agent Agreement between Parent and the Exchange
Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Representatives (the " _Exchange
Agent Agreement_ "), as of the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with the Companys
prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Units, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be exchanged for Units in
respect of the Preferred Unitholder Initial Stock Payment to be paid in
connection with the Merger and any cash necessary to pay the Preferred
Unitholder Initial Cash Payment to be paid in connection with the Merger (such
cash and such certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ," it being understood that
any and all interest earned on funds deposited therein pending payment shall
be turned over to Parent and that Parent shall pay all of the fees and
expenses of the Exchange Agent). At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent shall enter into the Exchange Agent Agreement with the
Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, make the payments provided for in this _Section 1.9_ and the
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) Parent will cause the Exchange Agent, on or prior to the Closing Date, to
deliver to each Unitholder at the address set forth opposite such Unitholders
name on _Schedule 1.9(b)_ (as updated from time to time in writing by the
Company) a merger payment processing form and instructions for obtaining
payment hereunder in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Representatives (a " _Merger Payment Processing Form_ "). Upon submission of a
completed Merger Payment Processing Form to the Exchange Agent, the holder of
the Units to which such Merger Payment Processing Form relates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash (without interest) and/or shares
of Parent Common Stock, as applicable, representing such holders respective
portion of the Merger Consideration calculated in accordance with, and payable
when and as provided in, this Agreement. Following the Effective Time and
pending a Unitholders submission of a Merger Payment Processing Form, each
such Unitholder of outstanding Units will be deemed, for all purposes, to hold
an irrevocable right to receive that amount of cash and/or shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to his, her or its respective portion of the Merger
Consideration into which such Unitholders Units shall have been so converted
in accordance with this Agreement.

(c) Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, no later than four (4)
Business Days after submission of a properly completed Merger Payment
Processing Form by a Unitholder (but in no event prior to the Closing), cash
(without interest) and/or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
representing such Unitholders respective portion of the Initial Merger
Consideration calculated and payable in accordance with this Agreement. Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver, not later than four (4) Business
Days after the later of submission of a properly completed Merger Payment
Processing Form by a Unitholder or the date upon which the Earnout
Consideration is paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to  _Section 1.12(c)_,
cash (without interest) and/or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
representing such Unitholders respective portion of the Earnout Consideration
calculated and payable in accordance with this Agreement. 

(d) At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
transfer books of the Company of the Units that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time.



 

13 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any holder of Units entitled
to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive in lieu thereof an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fraction (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share) by
the Parent Common Stock Value.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by a Preferred
Unitholder six (6) months after the Effective Time, and any portion of the
Earnout Consideration that remains unclaimed by a Unitholder six (6) months
after the date it is paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
1.12(c)_, shall be delivered to Parent and any such Unitholder who has not
returned a Merger Payment Processing Form in accordance with this _Section
1.9_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of
such Unitholders portion of the Initial Merger Consideration or Earnout
Consideration, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Representatives or
any other party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Units
two (2) years after the Effective Time or two (2) years after the date it is
paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 1.12(c)_ (or, in either case,
such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Government authority) shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

1.10 _Indemnification Escrow_.

(a) _Indemnification Escrow Account_. On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay
(or cause to be paid), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Indemnification Escrow Cash Amount and deliver the Indemnification Escrow
Shares, in each case to U.S. Bank, National Association, as escrow agent ("
_Indemnification Escrow Agent_ "), such Indemnification Escrow Amount to be
held in escrow to satisfy, at least in part (and only to satisfy), the
indemnity obligations described in _Section 7.2(a)_ of this Agreement. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent shall hold the Indemnification Escrow Amount in
a segregated account (" _Indemnification Escrow Account_ ") and invest, and
make payments of, the Indemnification Escrow Amount solely in accordance with
the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit G_ (" _Indemnification Escrow Agreement_ ").

(b) _The Representatives_. Upon any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 7.2_, the Representatives shall serve as the designated
representative of the Unitholders for purposes of receiving notices,
contesting claims, authorizing payments for such claims and all such other
proper purposes in all respects consistent with the provisions of _Section
1.13_ below.

(c) _Remaining Balance in Indemnification Escrow Account_. Upon the
expiration of the Indemnification Escrow Period, Parent and the
Representatives shall cause the Indemnification Escrow Agent (in accordance
with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement) to pay (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) any portion of the Indemnification
Escrow Cash Amount or distribute any remaining Indemnification Escrow Shares
to such account(s) designated by the Representatives (on behalf of the
Unitholders), any amounts and shares remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Account not then subject to claims for indemnification made by Parent in
accordance with the provisions of _Article 7_, for distribution to the
Unitholders in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement and this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _Indemnification
Escrow Period_ " means the period commencing on the Closing Date and
concluding on the 15 month anniversary of the Closing Date.



 

14 (d) _Merger Consideration Adjustments_. Except for any interest amount(s) paid
thereon (which interest, together with all dividends on Indemnification
Escrow Shares, shall be paid to (i) Parent with respect to any portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount distributed to Parent and (ii) the Unitholders
with respect to any portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount distributed
to the Unitholders), any amounts distributed to Parent pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 1.10_ shall be deemed to be and treated for all
purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

1.11 _Payment Mechanics of Unitholder Transaction Expenses_.

(a) _Estimated Unitholder Transaction Expenses_. At least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide to Parent an
estimate which has been approved in advance by the Representatives (which
estimate shall include such reserves as the Company determines in good faith
to be appropriate for any expenses that are not then known or
determinable) of the Unitholder Transaction Expenses (segregated by payee, to
the extent reasonably known or anticipated) that have been incurred prior to
the Closing and that will be incurred at or after the Closing (" _Estimated
Unitholder Transaction Expenses_ "), in each case whether or not paid prior
to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Unitholder Transaction
Expenses_ " means all expenses for legal, investment banking and/or financial
advisory fees of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the Merger),

respect of such matters of Goodwin Procter LLP, Orrick Herrington and Sutcliffe,
LLP, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and any other Person other than Ernst and

equal to 92.166% of any Unitholder Transaction Expenses in excess of
$5,000,000 (the " _Pro Rated Excess Unitholder Transaction Expenses_ ") shall
be paid out of the Preferred Unitholder Initial Cash Payment.

1.12  _Earnout_.

(a) _Earnout Consideration_. If the Surviving Company achieves the Qualified
MWs as calculated pursuant to _Schedule 1.12_ (the " _Earnout Calculation
Schedule_ "), then Parent shall pay to the Unitholders the amount of

15 (b) _Earnout Period_. Within 15 days following the expiration of the period
commencing on January 1, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2010 unless the
Closing has not occurred by January 1, 2010, in which case the period shall
commence on the Closing Date and end 12 months following the Closing Date (as
applicable, the " _Earnout Period_ "), Parent shall (i) deliver a statement
(the " _Earnout Statement_ ") to the Representatives containing Parents
calculation of the Earnout Consideration (the " _Preliminary
Earnout Consideration_ "). Parent shall permit the Representatives and their
accountants to review promptly upon reasonable request, on-site or otherwise,
during normal business hours as mutually agreed, all records, work papers and
other information prepared or used by Parent in connection with the
preparation of the Earnout Statement. The Representatives shall have up to 15
Business Days after receipt of the Earnout Statement and all requested

Parent claims that any Parent Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification or other payments under this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (to the extent permitted in accordance
with _Article 7_ or _Section 9.7(b)_ hereof) in an amount (the " _Excess
Amount_ ") in excess of (i) any remaining Cash Escrow Funds (as defined in
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement) or Escrowed Shares (as defined in the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement and valued at the Parent Common Stock Value)
less (ii) any Claimed Amount (as defined in the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement) which has not been previously paid to Parent, then Parent shall be
entitled to retain such Excess Amount from the Earnout Consideration until the
claims of any such Parent Indemnified Persons have been resolved;  _provided_
, _however_ , that the Excess Amount shall not be greater than the Adjustable
Earnout Setoff Amount with respect to those indemnification rights of Parent
Indemnified Persons that are subject to the Parent Special Matters Cap
(it being understood that if Releases are executed by 100% of the
Unitholders, the Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount shall be zero (0) and
(except in instances of breach, fraud or intentional misrepresentation) Parent
shall not be entitled to retain any portion of the Earnout Consideration with
respect to those indemnification rights of Parent Indemnified Persons that are
subject to the Parent Special Matters Cap); _provided_ , _further_ , that
(except in instances of willful breach, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation) Parent shall pay any portion of the Earnout Consideration
in excess of the Excess Amount to the Exchange Agent (for the account of the
Unitholders) by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
available funds or certificates, as applicable. Promptly following the
resolution of any such claims, Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent (for the
account of the Unitholders) by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately
available funds or certificates, as applicable, the portion, if any, of the
Excess Amount to which the Parent Indemnified Persons are not entitled and to

Amount to which they are entitled.

Section 1274(d) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder), and
shall be treated and reported by Unitholders and Parent as interest for such
purposes.



 

16 (e) _Covenants_. _Section 5.10_ and _Schedule 5.10_ set forth
certain covenants with respect to the operation of the Surviving Company
during the Earnout Period and certain methodologies to be followed in
determining whether the Qualified MWs have been achieved and whether the
Earnout Consideration, if any, will be payable to Unitholders in accordance
with this Agreement.

1.13 _Unitholders  Representatives; Actions_.

 

(a) Thomas Melone (" _Preferred Representative_ "), Carlos Domenech (" _Common
Representative_ ") and Peter J. Lee (" _Independent Representative_ " and,
together with the Preferred Representative and the Common Representative, the
" _Representatives_ ") have been appointed as the true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact of the Unitholders for all matters in connection with this
Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Expense Escrow Agreement,
the Exchange Agent Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to
and by virtue of the requisite approval of this Agreement by the Unitholders.
The Representatives will act on behalf of the Unitholders with respect to all
matters requiring action by the Unitholders under this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Expense Escrow Agreement, the Exchange
Agent Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and any other agreement to
which the Representatives will be a party in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
The Representatives hereby accept such appointment. Such Representatives may
be changed from time to time upon not less than five (5) Business Days prior
written notice to Parent. A vacancy in the position of (i) the Preferred
Representative (and any successor thereto) may be filled by the vote of the
Preferred Unitholders holding a majority of the Preferred Units, (ii) the
Common Representative (and any successor thereto) may be filled by the vote of
the Common Unitholders holding a majority of the Common Units and (iii) the
Independent Representative (and any successor thereto) may be filled by the
vote of the Unitholders holding a majority of all Units. In the event of the
incapacity of any Representative, a successor representative will be
appointed by the Unitholders entitled to fill the vacancy as described in the
foregoing sentence.

(b) At all times, an agreement among two of the three Representatives shall
be required to take any action in their capacity as the Representatives (on
behalf of the Unitholders) under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Representatives shall have
the full power and authority to take all actions required to be taken by the
Unitholders under this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the
Expense Escrow Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement or the Registration
Rights Agreement (collectively, the " _Unitholder Representative Agreements_
") and may take any action contemplated by any Unitholder Representative
Agreement which it believes is necessary or appropriate under such Unitholder
Representative Agreement, including, without limitation, executing each
Unitholder Representative Agreement, authorizing payments to be made with
respect hereto or thereto, objecting to such payments, giving and
receiving notices and communications permitted or required under any
Unitholder Representative Agreement, obtaining reimbursements as provided for
herein for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses and other obligations of or
incurred by the Representatives in connection with any Unitholder
Representative Agreement, disputing calculation of the Earnout Consideration,
defending all indemnity claims against the Indemnification Escrow Account or
Unitholders pursuant to this Agreement (an " _Indemnity Claim_ "), consenting
to, compromising or settling all Indemnity Claims, agreeing to, negotiating,
entering into settlements and compromises of, and demanding arbitration and
complying with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to
such claims, conducting negotiations with Parent or any other Parent
Indemnified Person and their respective agents regarding such claims and
dealing with Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person, the Exchange
Agent, the Expense Escrow Agent and the Indemnification Escrow Agent under
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Representatives shall have the full power and authority to interpret (on
behalf of the Unitholders) the terms and provisions of each Unitholder
Representative Agreement including, without 



 

17  limitation, to consent to any amendment or waiver of any provision hereof or
thereof in their capacity as Representatives. By giving notice to the
Representatives in the manner provided by  _Section 9.1_, Parent shall be
deemed to have given notice to all Unitholders. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Representatives, including an amendment, extension or
waiver of any provision of any Unitholder Representative Agreement, shall
require an agreement of two of three Representatives and shall constitute a
decision of the Unitholder(s) for whom such action was taken and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon such Unitholder(s). Any action taken by two
of three the Representatives may be considered by Parent, each other Parent
Indemnified Person, the Exchange Agent, the Expense Escrow Agent and the
Indemnification Escrow Agent to be the action of the Unitholder(s) for whom
such action was taken for all purposes of such Unitholder Representative
Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

(c) In the event that Parent gives notice to the Representatives of a claim
for which indemnification may be sought, the Representatives shall have the
authority to determine, in their sole judgment, whether to retain counsel (and
to select that counsel) to protect the Unitholders interests, subject to
_Section 7.5_, whether to assume the defense of or otherwise to control the
handling of the claim, whether to consent to indemnification and to make all
other decisions required to be made by the Unitholders pursuant to any
Unitholder Representative Agreement, including without limitation whether to
consent or withhold their consent to any settlement or compromise of a claim.

(d) The Representatives shall not have, by reason of this Agreement or the
performance of services as the Representatives, a fiduciary relationship with
any Unitholders. The Representatives shall not be liable to any Unitholder for
any act or omission taken pursuant to or in conjunction with this Agreement,
except for their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless first from the
Expense Escrow Fund, second from any portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount and Earnout Consideration to be distributed to the Unitholders and
Cashout UAR Holders and third from the Unitholders and Cashout UAR Holders,
severally and not jointly, against any and all Loss, liability or expense
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel) which may arise out of any action taken or omitted by them as the
Representatives in accordance with this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement, the Expense Escrow Agreement, the Exchange Agent Agreement or the
Registration Rights Agreement, as the same may be amended, modified
or supplemented, except such Loss, liability or expense as may result from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any Representative. This
indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement. The
Indemnification Escrow Agent, Expense Escrow Agent, Exchange Agent, Parent
and each other Parent Indemnified Person are hereby relieved from any
liability to any Person for any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representatives.

(e) The Representatives agree that within a commercially reasonable time after
receipt of notice of a claim, they shall give each Unitholder notice of the
same and shall from time to time keep the Unitholders reasonably apprised as
to developments with respect to such claim. Such notices shall be sent to the
Unitholders at their respective addresses as may be communicated to
the Representatives in writing by the Unitholders.

(f) The Unitholder Expense Contribution shall be paid into the Expense
Escrow Fund out of the Merger Consideration for the benefit of the
Unitholders and the Unitholders shall retain all right, title and interest in
such amount and $39,170 shall be paid into the Expense Escrow Fund out of
Parents cash on hand and does not represent any portion of the Merger
Consideration (the " _Parent Expense Contribution_ "). All disbursements from
the Expense Escrow Fund shall be made pro rata as between the Unitholder
Expense Contribution and the Parent Expense Contribution. As of the
expiration or termination of the Expense Escrow Agreement or as otherwise
contemplated thereby, any remaining portion shall be distributed to the
Unitholders (in accordance with the preference and payment provisions set
forth in this Agreement) and Parent, pro rata based on the initial
contribution amounts. At the 



 

18  Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Unitholder Expense Contribution and
the Parent Expense Contribution (the " _Expense Escrow Amount_ ") to be
deposited on behalf of the Unitholders and certain employees of the Company
with U.S. Bank, National Association (the " _Expense Escrow Agent_ "), such
deposit to constitute the expense escrow fund for the benefit and use of the
Representatives should it be necessary as provided herein (the " _Expense
Escrow Fund_ "). The Expense Escrow Fund shall be used to reimburse the out-
of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors
fees and expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Representatives in
performing all of its duties and obligations as the Representatives. Each
Unitholder hereby authorizes the Representatives to enter into an Escrow
Agreement (the " _Expense Escrow Agreement_ ") with the Expense Escrow Agent,
under such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Representatives
and the Expense Escrow Agent consistent with the terms hereof and in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent. If any portion of the Expense Escrow Amount
is disbursed to the Unitholders from the Expense Escrow Fund at the discretion
of the Representatives, such disbursement shall be allocated among the
Unitholders pursuant to the provisions of the Expense Escrow Agreement and
this Agreement. 

1.14 _Allocation_. The Company and Parent agree to treat the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1

Closing as set forth in _Sections 6.2(n)_ and _6.3(p)_. The Parties agree
that with respect to Parent, the Merger Consideration, the liabilities of the
Company and any other relevant items shall be allocated among the assets of
the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations thereunder and on a basis consistent with such valuation. The
Representatives, the Company and Parent and their Affiliates shall report,
act, and file Tax Returns in all respects and for all purposes consistent with
such valuation. The Company and Parent shall timely and properly prepare,
execute, file, and deliver all such documents, forms, and other information

Agreement. The Company does not have more than 1,403,985 Cashout UARs issued
and outstanding. Set forth on _Schedule 2.3(e)_ is a true, complete and
correct list of all Cashout UAR Holders, together with

determined in accordance with, and not in violation of, the terms of the
Operating Agreement and the UAR Plan (including, in each case, with respect to

Agreement by each of Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its respective terms, except to the
extent that enforceability hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the rights and
remedies of creditors generally and general equitable principles.

 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents by the Company or the Representatives, the performance
by the Company and the Representatives of their obligations hereunder or

of the organizational documents (including the Operating Agreement) of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or the Representatives. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.4(b)_ and subject to obtaining the Required Unitholder Approval,
neither of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Representatives is subject to or bound under applicable Law by any statute,
law, rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, injunction, or decree of any

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii) prevent, in any material
respect, the carrying out of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the

trust, lien, agreement, lease or contract which would (i) conflict with or
be breached or violated or the rights or the obligations thereunder
accelerated, increased, extinguished or terminated (whether or not with notice
or lapse of time or both), in any material respect, by the execution, delivery
or performance by them of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or (ii)
prevent, in any material respect, the carrying out of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents.



 

22 (d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.4(d)_ , no material permit, consent,
waiver, approval or authorization of, or declaration to or filing or
registration with, any third Person or any Government is required in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents by the Company or the Representatives or the
consummation by the Company or the Representatives of the transactions

assets and Real Property are adequate, in all material respects, for the
conduct of the Companys business in substantially the same manner and to
substantially the same extent as presently conducted by the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

(e) Except to the extent required pursuant to this Agreement, the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding Class A Units, Class B Units and Class C
Units, voting together as a single class (the " _Required Unitholder Approval_

necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger, and the approval

Agreement (the " _Required Board Approval_ " and, together with the Required
Unitholder Approval, the " _Required Approvals_ ") are the only vote of the

composition of matter by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conflicts with
or infringes, or would conflict with or infringe, the Intellectual Property or
other rights of any third party, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any third party offering a

covenant of any employment contract, patent disclosure agreement, invention
assignment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, noncompetition agreement or

Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to liability under: (i) any employee
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "); (ii) any agreement,
arrangement, plan, or policy, qualified or non-qualified, whether or not

favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (a copy of
which has been provided to Parent) and related trusts have been determined to

Section 406 or Code Section 4975) has occurred which would result in any
material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

its Subsidiaries has any liability or obligation to provide life, medical or
other welfare benefits to former or retired employees, other than as required
by COBRA or applicable state law.

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.24,_ all contributions with respect to
the Plans for all periods ending prior to the Closing Date (including periods
from the first day of the current plan year to the Closing Date) will be made
prior to the Closing Date by the Company and all members of the controlled
group in accordance with past practice and the recommended contribution in the
applicable actuarial report. All insurance premiums (including premiums to
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) have been paid in full, subject only
to normal retrospective adjustments in the ordinary course, to the extent
applicable to the Plans for policy years or other applicable policy periods
ending on or before the Closing Date.

whole or in part by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or at any time after
the Closing Date and the Company may take contribution holidays or withdraw
surplus from each Plan, subject only to approvals required by applicable Law
and the terms of such Plan;



 

45 (ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound

avoidance of doubt, Parties acknowledge and agree the Companys 2009 Bonus
Plan shall remain in place for the duration of its effective period.

(k) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.24_ , the consummation of the

to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, knowingly encourage, initiate,
accept or participate in any negotiations or discussions with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) disclose any confidential information not
customarily disclosed in the Ordinary Course of Business to any Third Party

none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
Agents, will grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries unless the Company Board shall have determined in good
faith that the failure to grant such waiver or release would be inconsistent
with its duties to the Unitholders under applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries set forth in this _Section 4.9_ by any Agent of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section

their respective Agents to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any

and Agents may communicate with any such Third Parties for the purpose of
complying with the next sentence. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors)
in possession of confidential information about the Company or any of its

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Agents within the last 12 months in
connection with consideration of an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy
all such information. During the term of this Agreement, subject to _Section
4.9(c)_, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the

with this Agreement.



 

58 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.9_,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from, at any

compliance with _Section 4.9(d)_, participating in negotiations or
discussions with, or disclosing any information to, any Third Party that
makes after the date hereof an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal in

good faith after consulting with its legal counsel and financial advisors
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result
in a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the Company (A) provides Parent with any
information to be provided to such Third Party which Parent has not
previously been provided prior to or substantially concurrently with the time

from such Third Party an executed confidentiality agreement (a copy of which
shall be provided, promptly after its execution, for informational purposes
only to Parent), with confidentiality provisions and other restrictive

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.9_, but
subject to compliance with _Section 4.9(d)_, at any time prior to receipt of
the Required Unitholder Approval and following receipt of a Superior Proposal
or the occurrence of an Intervening Event after the date hereof, if the
Company Board determines in good faith after consulting with its
legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties to Unitholders under applicable Law, then the
Company Board may (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if it
concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)(viii)_.

informed after taking such action of the status and material terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after

Proposal, or of any request for nonpublic information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party

into account all the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and

shall each give the other Party reasonable advanced notice of, and the
opportunity to participate in, any meeting or conference with any Antitrust
Authority relating to the Antitrust Filings or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent shall pay all filing and related fees in connection with any
Antitrust Filings that must be made by any of the Parties (including the
Company) under the HSR Act. __ The Company and Parent shall each furnish
outside counsel for the other Party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and 



 

70  communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) with any
Antitrust Authority concerning the review, clearance or approval of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent prohibited by
applicable Law or the instructions of such Antitrust Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise hold separate or encumber, before
or after the Effective Time, any material assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale,
divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company of any of their assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or to
consent to any agreement to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to
any material changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or
restriction on, or other impairment of Parents ability to own or
operate, any such material assets, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer,
receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to
the equity interests of the Surviving Company.

6.5 _Public Announcements_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or
making any other public announcement or scheduling any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, its
termination and the reasons therefor, and, except as may be required by
applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any national
securities exchange or association, no Party shall issue any such
press release, make any such statement or communication or schedule any such
press conference or conference call without the consent of the other Parties,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

6.6 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, the Parties shall do
such acts and execute such documents and instruments as may be reasonably
required to make effective the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.7 _Taxes_.

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns of the Company for
(i) all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time which are due
after the Closing Date (and which will be identified on _Schedule 6.7(a)_
delivered to Parent prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) all taxable periods
that include (but do not end on) the Effective Time (all such periods
described in this clause (ii) a " _Straddle Period_ ," and all Tax Returns
prepared under this _Section 6.7_ collectively " _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_
"). Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, (i) prepare all
such Pre-Closing Tax Returns consistent with past practices, unless otherwise
required by Law, (ii) provide such Pre-Closing Tax Returns that relate to
income Taxes that flow through to the Unitholders or that relate to other Pre-
Closing Tax Returns with respect to material amounts of Taxes to the
Representatives for their review, comment and approval (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld) as soon as reasonably practicable and not later
than 45 days prior to the due date of such Tax Returns (including extensions)
with respect to such income Tax Returns and not later than 10 days prior
to the due date of such Tax Returns (including extensions) with respect to
such non-income Tax Returns and (iii) make all such changes as are reasonably
requested by the Representatives pursuant to the preceding clause (ii). In no
event however shall such Pre-Closing Tax Returns be filed later than the date
required by applicable Tax Law (including any extensions). If there is
disagreement amongst Parent and the Representatives as to whether a comment is
reasonably requested pursuant to the preceding clause (iii), Parent and the
Representatives shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior to
the date on which such Pre-Closing Tax Return is required to be filed. In the
event Parent and the Representatives are unable to resolve any dispute in
good faith, the Representatives and Parent shall mutually request a
nationally-recognized, independent accounting firm mutually acceptable 



 

71  to the Representatives and Parent to resolve any issue in dispute. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated equally
between the Representatives (out of the Expense Escrow Fund) and Parent. All
income Tax Returns shall be filed by Parent and all Form K-1s, and any
corresponding state Tax forms, for all taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Effective Time which are due after the Closing Date shall be distributed
to Unitholders as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 45 days
prior to the due date (including extensions), unless the Representatives
consent to such delay or the parties are involved in a dispute as described
in the preceding sentence. In no event, however, shall such Form K-1s, and
any corresponding state Tax forms, fail to be delivered to the Unitholders by
the date so required by applicable Tax Law (including extensions).

(b) Any Tax refunds of the Company or its Subsidiaries that are received after
Closing by Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited
against Tax to which the Company or its Subsidiaries become entitled, that
relate to a pre-Closing period shall be for the account of the Unitholders to
the extent such refund or credit was a refund or credit of Tax for which
the Unitholders are responsible and Parent shall pay over to the
Representatives any such refund or the amount of any such credit within 15
days after receipt or application of any such credit against Tax.

(c) Parent shall not (and, after the Closing, shall not allow the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company to) amend any Tax Return for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, without
the prior written consent of the Representatives (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if the effect of such amended
Tax Return is to increase Taxes payable by the Unitholders or Taxes for which
the Unitholders are liable.

(d) Parent, the Company and the Representatives shall provide each other with
such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the others in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any
Government entity, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liabilities for Taxes. Such assistance shall include making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or
explanation of material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies
of relevant Tax Returns and supporting material. The party requesting
assistance hereunder shall reimburse the assisting party for reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in providing assistance. Parent, the Company and
the Representatives will retain for the full period of any statute of
limitations, and upon reasonable request will provide the others with, any
records or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit,
examination, proceeding or determination.

(e) None of Parent, the Company, the Acquisition Subsidiary or any of their
affiliates shall make an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect
to the purchase of any Subsidiaries of the Company when such election would
give rise to a tax liability for which the Company is liable.

(f) At the request of Parent, the Company shall make an effective election
under Section 754 of the Code and any comparable provision of foreign, state
or local law with respect to the acquisition of the Company.

6.8 _Proxy Statement/Offering Memorandum_.

(a) The Proxy Statement/Offering Memorandum, in the form delivered to the
Unitholders, together with any and all amendments or supplements thereto (the
" _Proxy Statement/Offering Memorandum_ "), shall constitute a disclosure
document for the offer and issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in accordance with this Agreement and a proxy statement for purposes
of obtaining approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by the 



 

72  Unitholders. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Offering Memorandum, the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall cooperate in delivering any
such amendment or supplement to all Unitholders as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

(b) Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
to be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, by
reason of Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act or otherwise, and otherwise to comply with all requirements of
applicable federal and state securities laws.

(c) Parent agrees promptly to advise the Company if, at any time prior to the
Closing, to Parents knowledge any information relating to Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary in the Proxy Statement/Offering Memorandum is or
becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material respect. The Company agrees
promptly to advise the Parent if, at any time prior to the Closing, to
the Companys Knowledge any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the Proxy Statement/Offering Memorandum is or becomes
incorrect or incomplete in any material respect. Such notifying party will
take such steps as may be necessary in order to cause the Proxy
Statement/Offering Memorandum, insofar as it relates to such party (or any of
its Subsidiaries), to continue to comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act after the delivery thereof to the
Unitholders

6.9 _Director and Officer Liability_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall have purchased a six-year tail
policy for its officers and directors liability insurance with an aggregate
premium not in excess of $81,000 and on terms consistent with those in effect
for the Company on July 7, 2009 and those set forth in the policies listed on
_Schedule 6.9_ (which policies have been made available to Parent), and
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
maintain such policy in full force and effect throughout the term of such
policy (with no obligation to extend the policy beyond its six-year term), and
to continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(b) Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary agree that all rights to
indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on
the personal liability of, each present and former director, officer,
employee, fiduciary and agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided for
in the respective operating agreement, charters or by-laws or otherwise in
effect as of July 7, 2009 or pursuant to the policies listed on _Schedule 6.9_
shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time and Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to perform the same; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a " _Claim_ ")
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such Claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Company also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided in
any written indemnification agreements between the Company and/or one or more
of its Subsidiaries in effect as of July 7, 2009 or the policies listed on
_Schedule 6.9_.

(c) The obligations under this _Section 6.9_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this _Section 6.9_ applies without the prior written consent of each
Person affected thereby (it being expressly agreed that the Persons to whom
this  _Section 6.9_ applies, including the present and former directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.9_ and shall be entitled to enforce the
covenants contained herein).



 

73 (d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to
the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume and
have the financial ability to fully perform the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.9_.

6.10 _Blocker Purchase_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.10(c)_, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent to purchase all
of the outstanding equity interests (" _Blocker Interests_ ") of the tax
blocker entities affiliated with the Persons set forth on _Schedule 6.10_ ("
_Blocker Entities_ ") that are, or will be prior to the Effective Time,
Unitholders of the Company but only insofar as such Blocker Entities do not
own in excess of the percentage of Units set forth next to the name of the
Persons affiliated with such Blocker Entities as set forth on  _Schedule
6.10_. Prior to the date hereof, Parent, Company and certain of the Blocker
Entities have worked together in good faith to negotiate a form of Blocker
Purchase Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit M_ (each, a "
_Blocker Purchase Agreement_ "), pursuant to which agreement such purchases
shall occur. As of the date hereof, certain of the Persons contemplated to be
parties thereto have agreed to certain provisions of the Blocker
Purchase Agreements, as reflected in the attached exhibit, but acknowledge
and agree that there are additional material provisions of the Blocker
Purchase Agreements that remain to be finalized and certain related amendments
to this Agreement that will be required to ensure each of the Company, the
Unitholders, the Blocker Owners (as defined below) and Parent are in
substantially the same position (after disregarding the effect of the Blocker
Entities) as a result of the transactions contemplated by any Blocker
Purchase Agreement that such Person would have been if Parent had acquired all
of the Units by virtue of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement (including the
escrow arrangements and indemnification rights of the Persons
contemplated hereby), subject, however, to the rights and obligations under
the Blocker Purchase Agreements of the Blocker Owners, Parent and the wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent that is contemplated to be a party to the Blocker
Purchase Agreements.

 

(b) During the ten (10) Business Day period following the date hereof, Parent
and the Company shall negotiate in good faith (including with the Blocker
Entities and Blocker Owners) and finalize the Blocker Purchase Agreements and
any related amendments to this Agreement with the objectives of:

(i) ensuring that the corporate mechanics will be treated as sale of the
Blocker Interests to a directly wholly owned subsidiary of Parent for U.S.
Federal Income Tax Purposes and not as sale of the underlying Units held by
the Blocker Entities;

(ii) ensuring that the Merger will be effectively consummated in accordance
with applicable Law and that, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of and fulfillment of the covenants and agreements by the Blocker
Owners in the form of the Blocker Purchase Agreement as finalized pursuant to
this _Section 6.10_, the only detriment to the Parent of consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Blocker Purchase Agreement is the loss of
the Foregone Tax Benefit;



 

74 (iii) providing reasonable assurances that a holder of Blocker Interest(s) (a
" _Blocker Owner_ ") shall have no greater and no fewer rights or obligations
with respect to the transactions, agreements, covenants, indemnities and other
provisions of this Agreement than such Blocker Owner would have had
if, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Units held by the Blocker
Entity had instead been held directly by such Blocker Owner (in proportion to
such Blocker Owners interest in the Blocker Entity) and been acquired by the
Parent by virtue of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall limit the rights or obligations of any Blocker Owner
with respect to such Blocker Entity as expressly provided in the Blocker
Purchase Agreements;

(iv) providing reasonable assurances that each Parent Indemnified Person shall
have no greater and no fewer rights or obligations with respect to the
transactions, agreements, covenants, indemnities and other provisions of this
Agreement than such Parent Indemnified Person would have had if, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Units held by the Blocker Entity had instead
been held directly by such Blocker Owner (in proportion to such Blocker
Owners interest in the Blocker Entity) and been acquired by the Parent by
virtue of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall limit the rights or obligations of any Parent
Indemnified Person with respect to such Blocker Entity as expressly provided
in the Blocker Purchase Agreements;

(v) amending this Agreement and/or any other Transaction Document as is
reasonably necessary or advisable to account for the fact that, as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall be the indirect owner of certain Units as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Blocker
Purchase Agreements and that any Units so indirectly owned by Parent as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be entitled to
consideration or any other rights pursuant to this Agreement with respect to
such Units and shall be "carved out" of the transactions contemplated hereby
and none of the Parent Indemnified Persons shall have any obligations
(including indemnity obligations) with respect to such ownership of those
Units or as a Unitholder under this Agreement; and

(vi) taking such other actions and reaching such other agreements as are
reasonably necessary to assure that, when taken together, the transactions
contemplated by the Blocker Purchase Agreements and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement equitably reflect the relative rights and
obligations of the respective parties (including the rights of the
Parent Indemnified Persons and the Unitholders hereunder) that are otherwise
reflected entirely within this Agreement on the date hereof, but for the
intention of Parent and its wholly owned subsidiary, on the one hand, and the
Blocker Owners, on the other hand, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Blocker Purchase Agreements on the terms set forth in this
_Section 6.10_.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this _Section 6.10_, if a Blocker
Owner refuses or otherwise does not enter into a form of Blocker Purchase
Agreement on terms which are consistent with the terms of this _Section
6.10_, then the Parent shall have no obligation to cause its wholly owned
subsidiary to purchase the Blocker Interest owned by such Blocker Owner, and
in lieu thereof, the Units owned by the applicable Blocker Entity shall be
acquired by Parent by virtue of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

Indemnification Escrow Agreement and subject to the limitations contained in
this _Article 7_ , Parent and its Affiliates (including, from and after the
Closing, the Surviving Company) and the present and former directors,
officers, partners, employees, successors, assigns, representatives and agents
of each of them in their capacities as such (the " _Parent Indemnified
Persons_ "), shall be indemnified and held harmless from and against, any and
all claims, losses, judgments, orders, damages, liabilities, expenses or costs
including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses (" _Losses_ ") actually
incurred by any of them, resulting from or arising out of:

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in

Parent Special Matters Cap);



 

76 (v) any continuing indemnification or similar obligation under any engagement
letter with Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs, whether or not such engagement
letter shall have been terminated (the " _Engagement Letter Indemnification
Indemnity_ ");

(vi) any claims (including claims made against the Company, the Surviving
Company or their respective directors, officers or managers) made by current
(i.e., those as of the date of this Agreement or those who become such between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date) or former (A) direct or
indirect holders of equity interests of the Company (including
the Unitholders and the Blocker Owners) or (B) holders of unit appreciation
rights or other rights to acquire equity interests in the Company of any kind
or nature whatsoever, in their capacity as a holder of equity interests or
holder of any such rights or any other capacity, in each case whether
absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or unknown, and
whether arising under any agreement or understanding (other than claims
against Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary for breach of this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents and any of the other agreements executed and
delivered by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary in connection herewith) or
otherwise at law or equity, and whether asserted prior to, at or after
the Effective Time (other than claims for which the facts or circumstances
giving rise to such claim first occur following Closing) (the " _Unitholder
Claims_ "); or

(vii) (X) the Companys and its Subsidiaries Taxes or their liability, if any
(for example, by reason of transferee liability or application of Treasury
regulation 1.1502-6) for Taxes of others, including, but not limited to,
Unitholders or any Affiliate of any Unitholder, or indemnified Losses payable
with respect to Taxes claimed or assessed against the Company or any

Company ending after the Closing Date arising out of the settlement or other
resolution of a proposed Tax adjustment that relates to a Tax period ending on
or before the Closing Date, in each case other than Taxes in the amounts and
to the extent reflected in the Balance Sheet, as such reserve is adjusted for
the passage of time through the Closing Date in the Ordinary Course of
Business, and in accordance with past custom and practice of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns, whether paid or unpaid, and (Y)
any Foregone Tax Benefit in excess of $2,500,000 (collectively, the " _Tax
Indemnity_ " and, together with the Scheduled Indemnity Matters, the Expenses
Indemnity, the Engagement Letter Indemnification Indemnity and the Unitholder
Claims, the " _Special Indemnity Matters_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the
obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons for any Tax shall be
limited to any Tax properly attributable to taxable periods, or portions
thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons for any Tax shall
not include any employment Taxes payable by the Company with respect to cash
retention bonus under the Cash Bonus Plan.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.6(d)_, _Section 7.6(g)_, _Section 7.7(b)_ and 
_Section 9.7(b)_, from and after the Closing, the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to recover any indemnified Losses to which they are entitled
hereunder in accordance with _Section 7.7(f)_, from the
Indemnification Escrow Account and by exercising its right of setoff against
$42,450,000 of any Earnout Consideration otherwise payable (the " _Adjustable
Earnout Setoff Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that
the Company shall deliver to Parent, at Closing, Unitholder Releases from
Unitholders holding more than 



 

77  50% of the Units (or, in the case of the Blocker Entities, the Unitholder
Releases shall be executed by the Blocker Owners and the Units that were held
by such Blocker Entities prior to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Blocker Purchase Agreements shall be deemed to be included
in such percentage) (the " _Minimum Release Threshold Percentage_ "), the
Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount shall be reduced on a pro rata basis between
the Minimum Release Threshold Percentage and 100% in the manner contemplated
by _Schedule 7.2(b)_ (it being understood that if Releases are executed and
delivered by 100% of the Unitholders, the Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount
shall be zero (0)). None of Parent, the Surviving Company, any other Parent
Indemnified Person or any of their respective Affiliates shall have a right to
setoff against payment of any Earnout Consideration due to Unitholders under 
_Article 1_ except to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement
(including _Sections 7.6(d)_ and _9.7(b)_ ).

7.3 _Indemnification of the Unitholders_. From and after the Closing, pursuant
to this Agreement and subject to the limitations contained in this _Article 7_
, Parent shall hold the Unitholders, and the present and former directors,
officers, partners, employees, successors, assigns, representatives and agents
of each of them in their capacities as such (the " _Unitholder Indemnified
Persons_ ") harmless and indemnify each of them from and against any and all
indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by any of them, resulting from
or arising out of:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; or

(b) any breach by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary of any covenant or
agreement of Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary contained in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document (including any breach by the Company of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document that is to be performed following the Merger).

7.4 _Notice of Claim_. In the event that Parent seeks indemnification on
behalf of a Parent Indemnified Person, or the Representatives or a Unitholder
seeks indemnification on behalf of a Unitholder Indemnified Person, such
Party seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give
reasonably prompt written notice in accordance with _Section 9.1_ to the
indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") specifying in reasonable
detail the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the
extent known, of the claim asserted; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
of a Person to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a
failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. If the claim
for Losses does not arise from a Third Person Claim (which such claims shall
be addressed as specified in _Section 7.5_ below), the Indemnifying Party
shall have 45 days after receipt of notice of such Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party to object to such claim by giving notice to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party has not so objected to the Claim Notice by
the close of business on such 45th day, the total amount of the Indemnity
Claim shall thereupon become chargeable to and payable by the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms and conditions, and subject
to the limitations set forth in this _Article 7_. If the Indemnifying Party
objects timely to the Claim Notice and the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party are unable to settle any such dispute, both Persons shall
have all rights and remedies at law or in equity subject to the limitations
set forth herein, and either the Indemnified Party or any Indemnifying Party
may commence an action or proceeding to resolve such dispute and determine
any amounts due hereunder from the Indemnifying Party.

For purposes of this _Article 7_ , the Representatives have the full
authority to act on behalf of the Unitholders and the Unitholder Indemnified
Persons as either an Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, provided
that, as set forth in this Agreement, Parent shall be deemed to have given
notice to all Unitholders pursuant to giving notice to the Representatives.



 

78 7.5 _Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons_.

(a) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Person
hereunder (a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is
actually known to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right of an Indemnified Party to be indemnified hereunder in respect of
claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to
so give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 7.5_, the Indemnifying Party shall then have the right, upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party (a " _Defense Notice_ ") within 30 days after
receipt from the Indemnified Party of notice of such claim, and using counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest, or
settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "),
_provided_  that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to
the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the Persons to be
indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge
any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement.
The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the
defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own
expense. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its
obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its
option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the
Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the Defense Notice
within said 30 day period, (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have
the control over said defense and settlement of the subject claim, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnified
Party such assistance and materials as it may reasonably request, and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its expense to participate in
the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing, and the Indemnifying
Party, if it is required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, will
be liable for all costs and settlement amounts paid or incurred in connection
therewith.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party delivers a Defense Notice with
respect to such Third Party Claim within 30 days after receipt thereof and
thereby elects to conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim, (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have control over said defense and,
subject to the provisions set forth below, settlement of the subject
claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate with and make available to
the Indemnifying Party such assistance, personnel and materials as it may
reasonably request, and (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have the rights at
its expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own
choosing. In such an event, the Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject
claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless (x)
there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of
the rights of any Person; (y) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and (z) the Indemnified Party
shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such
Third Person Claims effected without its consent, in which cases the consent
of the Indemnified Party shall not be required. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.5_,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control, but may participate
in, and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control,
including the right to select defense counsel, over the defense or settlement
of any claim (i) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified Party,
(ii) that involves criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party, (iii)
that, if unsuccessful, (A) would set a precedent that would materially
interfere with, or have a material adverse effect on, the business or
financial condition of the Indemnified Party or (B) would reasonably be
expected to exceed the Parent Cap, the Parent Special Matters Cap, the
Unitholder Special Matters Cap or the Unitholders Cap, as applicable, in any
case as mutually 



 

79  determined by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or, if such a
determination is not made within 15 days after the date on which the
Indemnified Party responds to the Defense Notice by asserting its rights
under this _Section 7.5(c)_, in accordance with its reasonable judgment or
(iv) subject to clause (iii)(B) above, that imposes liability on the part of
the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. In such event, the Indemnifying Party will still be
subject to its obligations hereunder but the Indemnified Party will not settle
the subject claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

7.6 _Limitations on Indemnity_. 

(a) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification in
respect of indemnified Losses pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ unless and
until such indemnified Losses exceed, in the aggregate, the threshold set
forth on _Schedule 7.6(a)-1_ (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), but then
to the full extent of each such indemnified Loss that exceeds the De Minimis
Threshold (it being understood that any indemnified Loss that is equal to or
less than the De Minimis Threshold shall not be deemed to be an indemnifiable
Loss or count toward the Indemnification Threshold). In no event shall Losses
that count toward the Special Deductible also count toward the Indemnification
Threshold and vice-versa. No claim for indemnification may be asserted in
respect of indemnified Losses pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ except to the
extent that the dollar value of each such Loss exceeds the threshold set forth
on _Schedule 7.6(a)-2_ (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ "), _provided_ that, for
purposes of this determination, a "claim" will be deemed to arise from a
single circumstance or a collection of circumstances based on similar facts
that give rise to a single claim or cause of action, whether or not such cause
of action is pursued in any court proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither the Indemnification Threshold limitation
nor the De Minimis Threshold limitation shall apply in any manner whatsoever
to any breach of the Company Fundamental Reps or in instances of willful
breach, fraud or intentional misrepresentation by such Party.

(b) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification
in respect of indemnified Losses related to the Special Indemnity Matters
under _Sections 7.2(a)(iii)_ , _7.2(a)(iv)_ , _7.2(a)(v)_ or _7.2(a)(vi)_
unless and until such indemnified Losses exceed, in the aggregate, the
threshold set forth on _Schedule 7.6(b)_ (the " _Special Deductible_ ") and
then only to the extent of any such excess. All Unitholder Transaction
Expenses paid by Parent at Closing pursuant to  _Section 1.11_ shall be
counted toward the Special Deductible and, if such Unitholder Transaction
Expenses paid by Parent at Closing are equal to or in excess of the Special
Deductible (which, for the avoidance of doubt, they shall be if there shall
exist any Pro Rated Excess Unitholder Transaction Expenses), shall fully
satisfy the Special Deductible. In no event shall Losses related to the
Special Indemnity Matters that count against the Special Deductible also count
toward the Indemnification Threshold and vice-versa.

(c) Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify Unitholder Indemnified
Persons in respect of indemnified Losses pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ unless
such indemnified Losses exceed, in the aggregate, the Indemnification
Threshold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Indemnification Threshold limitation shall not apply in any manner whatsoever
to any breach of a representation or warranty contained in _Sections 3.1_
(Organization; Qualification and Power; Enforceability; Noncontravention),
_3.2_ (Capitalization and Related Matters) or _3.5_ (Brokers; Finders) (the "
_Parent Fundamental Reps_ ") or in instances of willful breach, fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by such Party.

(d) The aggregate amount of Losses that may be recovered by the Parent
Indemnified Persons from and after the Closing (i) under  _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ for any matter other than a breach of a Company Fundamental Rep or
_Section 2.9(a)_ shall not exceed the Indemnification Escrow 



 

80  Amount (the " _Parent Cap_ ") or (ii) under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ with
respect to a breach of a Company Fundamental Rep or _Section 2.9(a)_, or
pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_, _7.2(a)(iv)_ , _7.2(a)(v)_ ,
_7.2(a)(vi)_ or _7.2(a)(vii)_ in respect of a Special Indemnity Matter (each a
" _Parent Cap Carveout Matter_ ") shall not exceed the Parent Cap plus
the Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount (as such Adjustable Earnout Setoff
Amount may be reduced in accordance with _Section 7.2(b)_) (the " _Parent
Special Matters Cap_ "). For purposes of clarity, any Losses recovered by a
Parent Indemnified Person in respect of the matters subject to the Parent Cap
shall count toward the Parent Special Matters Cap but Losses that count toward
the Parent Special Matters Cap shall not count toward the Parent Cap.
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this _Section 7.6(d)_, neither the
Parent Cap nor the Parent Special Matters Cap shall apply in instances of
willful breach, fraud or intentional misrepresentation. In addition, neither
the Parent Cap nor the Parent Special Matters Cap shall apply to
indemnification rights under or pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, and it is
agreed that the Parent Indemnified Persons shall have the right, in addition
to any other remedies that may be available to any Parent Indemnified Person
(including Parent) under the terms of this Agreement, to set-off against the
Earnout Consideration in full with respect to such indemnification rights.

(e) The aggregate amount of indemnified Losses that may be recovered by the
Unitholder Indemnified Persons from and after the Closing (i) under _Section
7.3(a)_ for any matter other than a breach of a Parent Fundamental Rep shall
not exceed the amount set forth on _Schedule 7.6(e)_ (the " _Unitholder Cap_
") or (ii) under _Section 7.3(a)_ with respect to a breach of a Parent
Fundamental Rep (a " _Unitholder Cap Carveout Matter_ ") shall not exceed an
amount equal to the Unitholder Cap plus the Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount
(the " _Unitholder Special Matters Cap_ "). For purposes of clarity, any
Losses recovered by a Unitholder Indemnified Person in respect of the matters
subject to the Unitholder Cap shall count toward the Unitholder Special
Matters Cap but Losses that count toward the Unitholder Special Matters Cap
shall not count toward the Unitholder Cap. Notwithstanding the first sentence
of this _Section 7.6(e)_, neither the Unitholder Cap nor the Unitholder
Special Matters Cap shall apply to the obligations of any Party hereto in
instances of willful breach, fraud or intentional misrepresentation by such
Party. In addition, neither the Unitholder Cap nor the Unitholder Special
Matters Cap shall apply to indemnification rights under or pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)_.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons in respect of the
Special Indemnity Matters pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_, _7.2(a)(iv)_ ,
_7.2(a)(v)_ and _7.2(a)(vi)_ shall expire and be of no further force and
effect on the date that is 36 months following the Closing Date and the
obligations to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons in respect of the
Special Indemnity Matters pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(vii)_ shall expire and
be of no further force and effect on the date that is 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the
matters addressed therein (including any extensions or tollings thereof).

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the rights of Parent as contained in _Section 1.12(c)_, _Section
7.6(d)_ or _Section 9.7(b)_, from and after the Closing the Parent
Indemnified Persons shall first recover any Losses from the Indemnification
Escrow Account before exercising their right of setoff (only up to the amount
of the Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount, if any, except as otherwise set forth
in this Agreement, including in _Section 1.12(c)_, _Section 7.6(d)_ or
_Section 9.7(b)_) against the Earnout Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement or making any claim for Losses against any Unitholder individually
on a several, not joint, basis.

7.7 _Additional Indemnification Matters_.

(a) For all Tax purposes, all indemnification payments under this _Article 7_
shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Merger Consideration to
the extent permitted by applicable law.



 

81 (b) For all purposes hereunder, from and after the Closing a Parent
Indemnified Person shall be permitted to claim for indemnification for only
(i) 92.166% of any Parent Indemnified Persons Losses, until the aggregate
amount of indemnified Losses paid to the Parent Indemnified Persons under this
_Article 7_ and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement shall equal the
Indemnification Escrow Amount and (ii) 100% of any Parent Indemnified Person
Losses in excess thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to this clause
(ii) taking effect, 7.834% of any Parent Indemnified Persons indemnified
Losses referenced in the foregoing clause (i) shall be recovered by Parent on
behalf of such Parent Indemnified Person in accordance with the Cash Bonus
Plan. By way of illustrative example, if a Parent Indemnified Person suffers
an indemnifiable Loss of $10,000,000 for which it desires to seek
indemnification pursuant to any section of this _Article 7_ , the amount for
which it shall be permitted to make a claim for indemnification is
$9,216,600. However, if the Parent Indemnified Persons suffer indemnifiable
Losses, in the aggregate, of $32,551,000, the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which they shall be entitled to recover under this
_Article 7_ and the Indemnification Escrow Agreement shall equal $30,001,000
(it being understood that an additional $2,550,000 of indemnifiable Losses
shall be recovered by Parent on behalf of Parent Indemnified Person in
accordance with the Cash Bonus Plan). 

(c) A Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this _Article 7_ for any Losses in respect of the first matter listed on
_Schedule 7.2(a)(iii)_ only to the extent that such Losses exceed the amount
described on _Schedule 7.7(c)_.

(d) No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted, by
Parent or its representatives, of the Company or otherwise, shall in any way
limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any claim for
indemnification by Parent or any Parent Indemnified Person under this
Agreement. No information or knowledge acquired, or investigations conducted,
by the Company, any of the Unitholders or their respective representatives, of
Parent or otherwise, shall in any way limit, or constitute a waiver of, or a
defense to, any claim for indemnification by the Unitholders or any Unitholder
Indemnified Person under this Agreement.

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of a Parent Indemnified Person, Unitholder
Indemnified Person or any other party or third party beneficiary hereto, after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided to any
Parent Indemnified Person under this _Article 7_ shall, from and after the
Closing, be net of any amounts actually recovered under insurance policies
maintained by the Company in effect immediately prior to Closing and
applicable to such Losses, net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses actually
incurred by the Parent Indemnified Person in obtaining such recovery. Parent
will use its commercially reasonably efforts to promptly seek full recovery
under the insurance policies referenced in the foregoing sentence; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Parent Indemnified Person (including Parent) shall have
no obligation to first submit or to collect upon any applicable insurance
coverage as a precondition to making a claim for indemnification hereunder or
obtaining indemnification for Losses therefor, and the Parties hereto agree,
without limiting any other rights any Indemnifying Party may have against
Parent, not to delay in any manner the payment to Parent or any Parent
Indemnified Person of such indemnification based on Parents non-fulfillment
of the foregoing obligation at the time any such claim is made. To the extent
that any insurance payment is actually recovered by a Parent Indemnified
Person after the related indemnification payment has been made pursuant to
this Agreement; the Parent Indemnified Person will pay over to the
Indemnification Escrow Agent (to the extent that (a) amounts have been paid to
Parent out of the Indemnification Escrow Account and (b) the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement remains in effect) or to the Exchange Agent (or, if the
Exchange Agent is no longer engaged, to the Representatives) for distribution
to the applicable 



 

82  Unitholders (in any other circumstance) the amounts of such insurance
payments promptly after they are actually recovered. If permitted under the
terms of the applicable insurance policies, in lieu of the foregoing, the
Parent Indemnified Person may subrogate or assign its rights to recover under
such insurance policies to the Representatives (on behalf of the Unitholders)
or their designee.

(g) Except for Losses related to Special Indemnity Matters and indemnification
under or pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_ (to which this _Section 7.7(g)_
does not apply), from and after the Closing, the Loss of a Parent Indemnified
Person for breach of representations and warranties of the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall be net of any reserves established on the Balance
Sheet in respect of the matter to which the Loss relates.

(h) In the absence of willful breach, fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
under no circumstance shall any Parent Indemnified Person or Unitholder
Indemnified Person be entitled to indemnification for any punitive or
exemplary damages unless any of the foregoing is actually paid to a third
party.

(i) Any Loss for which any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under this _Article 7_ shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of
more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement but nothing
herein shall be deemed to restrict the ability of the Indemnified Party to
select the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement upon which to base
the Indemnified Partys claim.

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein or elsewhere to the contrary,
and except for the materiality qualification in _Section 2.17(a)_, all
"material" or similar materiality type qualifications (including "Company
Material Adverse Effect" and "Company Material Adverse Change") contained in
the representations and warranties (or definitions used in the representations
and warranties) set forth in  _Article 2_ of this Agreement shall be ignored
and not given any effect for purposes of the indemnification provisions
hereof, including, without limitation, for purposes of determining whether or
not a breach of a representation or warranty has occurred, determining
whether the thresholds in _Section 7.6_ have been surpassed and/or
determining the amount of any indemnifiable Losses; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the terms "Material Contracts" and "Material Permits" shall have the
meaning ascribed to that term as set forth therein without effect of this
_Section 7.7(j)_.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
_Sections 7.2(b)_ , _7.6(d)_ , _7.6(g)_ and _9.7(b)_ , Parent shall be
entitled to set-off against payment of any Earnout Consideration due to any
Unitholders under _Section 1.12_ hereof any amount payable (to the extent
permitted under _Section 1.12_, _Section 7.2(b)_, _Section 7.6(d)_,
_Section 7.6(g)_ or  _Section 9.7(b)_ hereof) to any Parent Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Article 7_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
provided for in or contemplated by _Section 9.7(b)_, Parent shall not be
entitled to set-off in excess of the Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount with
respect to those indemnification rights of Parent Indemnified Persons that are
subject to the Parent Special Matters Cap (it being understood that if the
Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount is zero (0), none of Parent, the Surviving
Company, any other Parent Indemnified Person or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have a right to set-off against payment of any Earnout
Consideration due to Unitholders under _Article 1_ , except as provided for
in or contemplated by _Section 9.7(b)_, with respect to those indemnification
rights of Parent Indemnified Persons that are subject to the Parent Special
Matters Cap).



 

83 ARTICLE 8

_TERMINATION_

8.1 _Termination_.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time only as follows,
whether before or after the Required Unitholder Approval has been obtained:

(i) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent (on behalf of itself and
Acquisition Subsidiary);

(ii) by either the Company or Parent (on behalf of itself and Acquisition
Subsidiary) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 31,
2009 (the " _Drop Dead Date_ "); _provided_ _that_ no Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) if such Partys failure to fulfill any
of its obligations under this Agreement shall be the primary reason for the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before said date; _provided_ , _further_
, that if any Government authority or applicable Law requires the Company and
Parent to postpone the Closing Date in order to obtain a consent or approval
(which is required prior to the consummation of the Merger) from such
Government authority, or any waiting period under any applicable Antitrust
Law has not expired or been terminated, such date shall automatically be
extended to such date as required by such Government authority or as of which
such waiting period has expired or been terminated (which shall be in no
event later than January 31, 2010);

(iii) by either the Company or Parent, at any time after the Company
Unitholder Meeting, if the Company has not obtained the Required Unitholder
Approval by such time;

(iv) by Parent, at any time after the Company Unitholder Meeting, if the
Company has not obtained the Company Unitholder Approval by such time;

(v) by either the Company or Parent, if any Government authority shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have
taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-
appealable and makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibits
consummation of the Merger (a " _Governmental Order_ "); 

(vi) by Parent, if (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or
the Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into a definitive agreement
concerning a Superior Proposal or (B) the Company Board shall have failed to
publicly confirm the Company Recommendation within five (5) Business Days of a
written request by Parent that it do so;

(vii) by Parent if the Company shall have materially breached any of its
obligations under _Section 4.9_ such that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.3(a)_ would be incapable of being satisfied;

(viii) by the Company, if the Company Board authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive
agreement concerning a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (x)
the Company shall have paid any amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.6(b)_ in
accordance with the terms, and at the times, specified therein and (y) 



 

84  this Agreement may be terminated on this basis only at a time that is after
5:00 p.m. Central time on the fifth (5th) Business Day following Parents
receipt of written notice from the Company that the Company Board is prepared
to take such action, and at the end of such period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal relative to the Merger, as supplemented by any
Counterproposal (defined below) that Parent has submitted to the Company. Any
such written notice shall attach the most current version of such agreement
(or a description of all material terms and conditions thereof), and state
that the Company Board otherwise intends to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change (subject to compliance with this Agreement), and/or to terminate this
Agreement and to enter into a binding written agreement concerning an
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal. During any such
five (5) Business Day period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the
Company a counterproposal to such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Counterproposal_
") and Parent and the Company shall negotiate in good faith in respect of any
such Counterproposal (it being understood that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement or enter into any such binding agreement during such five (5)
Business Day period, and that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and an additional three (3) Business Day
period);

(ix) by Parent if (A) there shall have been a breach of any representation or
warranty on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or (B) there
shall have been a breach by the Company or any of the Representatives of any
of its covenants or agreements hereunder, such that, in the case of either
clause (A) or (B), the conditions set forth in  _Section 6.3(a)_ would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date and Parent has provided the
Company with detailed written notice of such circumstance not less then 15
days prior to terminating the Agreement pursuant to this provision (except
that such 15 day period shall be decreased to a period equal to the number of
days, if any, prior to the Drop Dead Date if there are not 15 days remaining
prior to the Drop Dead Date at the time of the delivery of such
written notice, and it being agreed that the Parent shall be entitled to
exercise its termination rights under this _Section 8.1(a)(ix)_ on the Drop
Dead Date in any case if there shall have been a Company Material Adverse
Effect), _provided_   _that_ , with respect to clauses (A) and (B) above,
Parent has not materially breached any of its obligations hereunder and failed
to timely cure such breach; or

(x) by the Company if (A) there shall have been a breach of any representation
or warranty on the part of Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary set forth in this
Agreement, or (B) there shall have been a breach by Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary of any of their respective covenants or agreements hereunder, such,
that in the case of either clause (A) or (B), the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.2(a)_ would be incapable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date
and the Company has provided Parent with detailed written notice of such
circumstance not less then 15 days prior to terminating the Agreement
pursuant to this provision, _provided_ _that_ , with respect to clauses (A)
and (B) above, the Company has not materially breached any of its obligations
hereunder and failed to timely cure such breach.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the preceding
clauses (ii) through (xi) shall give written notice of such termination to
the other party in accordance with _Section 9.1_ below.

(b) _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination pursuant to this
_Article 8_, the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without
further action by the Parties hereto and this Agreement shall terminate, and
there shall be no liability under this Agreement on the part of any Party
hereto, except as set forth in the last sentence of _Section 4.4(a)_ and in
_Sections 6.5_ , _8.1_ and _9.6_ hereof, 



 

85  which provisions shall remain in full force and effect. If this Agreement is
terminated as provided herein, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to redeliver all documents, work papers and other material
(including any copies thereof) of any other Party relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the execution hereof, to
the Party furnishing the same. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
relieve any party from any liability for any willful inaccuracy, willful
misrepresentation or willful breach of this Agreement or any representation,
warranty or covenant contained herein prior to termination.

embody the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements and understandings relative to such subject matter.

9.3 _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and the various rights
and obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Parties and their respective successors, heirs, devisees,
legatees, legal representatives and permitted assigns (whether direct or

neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder shall be transferred, delegated, or assigned (by operation of Law
or otherwise) by Parent without the prior written consent of the
Representatives (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or by the
Representatives or the Company without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall have the right to transfer and assign its and Acquisition

40% of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more
than 40% of the consolidated assets of the Company, (B) any tender offer
(including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in such Third Party beneficially owning 40% or more of any class
of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 40% of
the consolidated assets of the Company, or (C) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets,
reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 40% of the
consolidated assets of the Company.

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section
9.6_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary would
not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly
to pay any amount due to Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary pursuant to this
_Section 9.6_, it shall also pay any costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary in connection
with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment
against the Company for such amount, together with interest on any amount of
the Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate (as published
in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such payment should have
been made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any termination
(or attempted termination) of this Agreement in circumstances where the
Termination Fee is payable in accordance with _Section 9.6(b)_, the payment
by the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee (and, where applicable, the
reimbursement by the Company of expenses as contemplated by  _Section
9.6(b)_ in addition to payment of the Termination Fee) shall constitute
liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim
which Parent would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or against any
of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers,
members, or unitholders, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that,
in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with
respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement in
circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable in accordance with _Section
9.6(b)_, the rights to payment under _Section 9.6(b)_: (i) constitute a
reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any
actual termination of this Agreement and (ii) shall be in full and complete
satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the foregoing.

9.7 _Remedies_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement (including
the right to seek specific performance) are cumulative and without prejudice
to any other rights or remedies under Law. Without limitation of the
foregoing, the Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that either Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, without the
posting of any bond, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any court
specified in _Section 9.10_, in addition to any other remedy 



 

89  to which it is entitled under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if, following a termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(a)(viii)_ and the related payment of the Termination Fee and
reimbursement of expenses under _Section 9.6(b)_, Parent files a lawsuit
purporting to challenge the validity of such termination and purporting to
seek specific performance of the Companys obligation to consummate the
Merger, Parent shall, prior to filing any such lawsuit, return to the Company
all amounts previously paid under _Section 9.6(b)_ together with interest on
the amount so returned at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate (as
published in The Wall Street Journal) in effect on the date such payment was
originally made for the period between Parents receipt of such amounts and
the Companys receipt of such amounts when returned. Nothing in this 
_Section 9.7(a)_ (including, without limitation, the proviso to the preceding
sentence) is intended to, or shall be interpreted as, amending, modifying or
superseding the provisions of _Section 9.6(c)_ such that, in the event of a
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Termination Fee
(and, where applicable, the reimbursement by the Company of expenses as
contemplated by _Section 9.6(b)_ in addition to payment of the Termination
Fee) is payable under _Section 9.6(b)_, the payment of the Termination Fee
(and, where applicable, the reimbursement by the Company of expenses as
contemplated by _Section 9.6(b)_ in addition to payment of the Termination
Fee) shall constitute liquidated damages.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the rights of the Parent Indemnified
Persons and the Unitholder Indemnified Persons to indemnification relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be strictly
limited to those contained in _Article 7_ , and such indemnification rights
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parent Indemnified Persons
and the Unitholder Indemnified Persons, as applicable, subsequent to the
Effective Time with respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement or arising in connection herewith except that the foregoing
shall not limit any rights in instances of fraud, willful breach or
intentional misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary
in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, in instances of willful breach,
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, then Parent shall be entitled to any
and all remedies at law or in equity, including without limitation rights of
setoff against the Earnout Consideration or otherwise.

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in
accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of
Delaware, without reference to its choice of law rules.

9.9 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS _SECTION 9.9_.

9.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the Parties irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by a
Party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in the
state courts located in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, County of New Castle State of



 

90  Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to
any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in
any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that a
Party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named court
for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 9.10_, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
court (whether through judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Each Party hereto
waives all personal service of any and all process upon such Party related to
this Agreement and consents that all service of process upon such Party shall
be made by hand delivery, certified mail or confirmed telecopy directed to
such Party at the address specified in _Section 9.1_ hereof; and service
made by certified mail shall be complete seven (7) days after the same shall
have been posted. The prevailing party in any litigation shall be entitled to
reimbursement of its reasonable legal fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 9.10 shall not apply to the matters addressed in
_Sections 1.12_ ( other than _Section 1.12(c)_), _5.10_ and _6.7_.

9.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
Parties hereto.

9.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the time
for the performance of the obligations or other acts of the Parties hereto
may be extended by the other Party or Parties and any failure by any of the
Parties hereto to comply with any of the obligations, agreements or conditions
set forth herein may be waived by the other Party or Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such waiver shall not be deemed a waiver of any other
obligation, agreement or condition or as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
waiver of the same obligation, agreement or condition by such party;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such extension or
waiver is to be enforced.

9.13 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

9.14 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The Parties hereby agree that there are
no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement, other than Indemnified Parties
and, with respect to _Section 6.9_, the Persons benefiting therefrom, who
are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof and entitled to
enforce their rights thereunder.

9.15  _Subsidiary Compliance_. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be
taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate
and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company or Parent to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, to cause such Subsidiary to take such
action.



 

91 9.16 _Conflicts and Privilege_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties
hereto that the Representatives have retained Goodwin Procter LLP to act as
the Representatives counsel in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary hereby agree that, in the event that
a dispute arises after the Closing between the Parent and its Subsidiaries on
the one hand, and the Representatives and the Unitholders on the other hand,
Goodwin Procter LLP may represent the Representatives and Unitholders in such
dispute even though the interests of the Representatives and Unitholders may
be directly adverse to Parent, and its Subsidiaries, and even though Goodwin
Procter LLP may have represented the Company or its Subsidiaries in a matter
substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries. Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary
further agree that, as to all communications among Goodwin Procter LLP, the
Company, its Subsidiaries, the Representatives and/or any Unitholder that
relate specifically and solely to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence as the same relate or apply to any specific communications as
between the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company and Goodwin Procter LLP
belongs to the Representatives and the Unitholders and the same may be
controlled by the Representatives and Unitholders and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, the Surviving Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries on the one
hand and a third party other than the Representatives or a Unitholder, on the
other hand, Parent, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
to such third party.

1 _Schedule 1.12(a)_

_EARNOUT CALCULATION SCHEDULE_



     | 1. | During the Earnout Period, the methodology described below
under Schedule 1.12(i) shall be utilized by Parent and the Surviving Company
in respect of the Earnout and the potential achievement of the Maximum
Earnout Target. Upon the termination of the Earnout Period, the Earnout
Statement to be delivered by Parent under Section 1.12(b) shall state the
Aggregate Qualified Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects (as defined
below) and, subject to the provisions of Section 1.12, Parent shall pay the
Unitholders the consideration specified in paragraph (ii) below in accordance
with the terms of Section 1.12. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 2. | Subject to Section 1.12(c) for pending claims and Parents
setoff rights under Section 7.7(k) in order to satisfy Parents right to
receive indemnification, notwithstanding the term of the Earnout Period,
within fifteen (15) Business Days following the achievement of 80MWs of
Aggregate Qualified Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects, Parent shall
cause the early payment of the Earnout Consideration to be paid to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.12 for distribution to the Unitholders
pursuant to Section 1.12. As used herein, Early Payment means the lesser of
(i) $[*] or (ii) an amount equal to the greater of (x) $[*] minus the
Adjustable Earnout Setoff Amount or (y) $0. To the extent that all or a part
of any such Early Payment is delayed by the operation of Section 7.7(k) but
not actually used for such set-off purposes during the Earnout Period, it
shall be released as part of the Earnout consideration at the end of the
Earnout Period in accordance with section 1.12. 
---|---|--- 


     | 3. | On a monthly basis the Surviving Company financial, planning
and analysis team will present to the CEO of Parent, with a copy to the
Representatives, the information required to be provided under Schedule 5.10
and the cumulative qualified MWs completed and a quarterly forecast for the
remainder of the year. The Parent CEO and president of the Surviving Company
will as part of a monthly meeting ensure that the Earnout execution and
Parents goals are aligned, with any material deviation to be subject to the
prior written consent of the Representatives. In furtherance of the foregoing,
by mutual written agreement, Parent and the Representatives may agree to
amend the Earnout methodology contained in this Schedule 1.12 as necessary or
advisable as long as it is for the benefit of the combined business and it is
not unfair to the recipients of the Earnout Consideration. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 4. | Pursuant to the Surviving Companys efforts to achieve the
Maximum Earnout Target, Parent and Surviving Company shall develop a mutually
approved rolling quarterly module supply roadmap (the " _Module Supply Plan_
"), describing what modules, and at what prices, Surviving Company can obtain
modules that include Parent wafers. The Module Supply Plan shall be dated as
of Closing Date and updated on no less than a quarterly basis. The
Representatives shall receive a copy of the Module Supply Plan and such
updates as they are developed. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5. |

In the event (x) Parent and/or a third-party module company described in the
Module Supply Plan are unable to deliver such modules on the terms and
conditions (including, without limitation, price, warranty, efficiency,
regulatory and technology approval) provided for in the Module Supply Plan or
(y) Parent does not timely provide such Module Supply Plan, then Surviving
Company may purchase modules not in conformity  

---|---|--- 



 

2  with the Module Supply Plan (in all other situations, Surviving Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase modules in conformity
with the Module Supply Plan).  

---|--- 



     | 6. | In the event a solar development project requires modules
that are not viable from a third-party module company utilizing Miyagi wafers
(including, without limitation, due to technological, cost, permitting or
other reasons), Surviving Company may purchase modules not in conformity with
the Module Supply Plan 
---|---|--- 



     | 7. | If a project is not completed on a timely basis, or if the
cost of such project is increased due to a failure of Parent to abide by the
Module Supply Plan, such project shall be deemed to have achieved a GPM of
[*]% or IRR of [*]%, as applicable, for such Development MWs (as defined in
Schedule 1.12(i), sub-sections II(a) and III(a) below) (the " _Automatic MW
Qualification_ ");  _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the failure
of a third party supplier to meet its commitments to Parent or Surviving
Company under the agreed upon Module Supply Plan trigger the deemed completion
of such a project unless such failure is attributable in whole or in
substantial part to the actions or inactions of Parent. 
---|---|--- 

_Section 1.12(i)_

The Unitholders of the Surviving Company shall be entitled to an Earnout based
on the Aggregate Qualified Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects if the
Aggregate Qualified Adjusted MWs exceed the thresholds set forth in Section
1.12(ii). The Aggregate Qualified Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects
shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Development MWs (and the Revised
Development MWs, if applicable) achieved during the Earnout Period that
satisfy either the GPM Test or IRR Test, as defined below and (ii) the
Automatic MW Qualification (as defined in paragraph 7 above).



     | I. | _Earnout calculation generally; Definitions_ 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | " _Development MW_ " shall mean the MWs of nameplate
capacity, DC, for solar photovoltaic projects where: 
---|---|--- 


     | i. | The Surviving Company directly develops a project 
---|---|--- 



     | ii. | The Surviving Company develops a project through its channel
partner program in the U.S. if the Surviving Company facilitates the provision
of the modules for installation by the channel partner 
---|---|--- 



     | iii. | The Surviving Company installs projects through a joint
venture (e.g., SkyPower) and the Surviving Company, directly or indirectly
through a subsidiary, is the general, prime or sub-contractor engineering,
procurement and construction provider 
---|---|--- 



     | iv. | 100% of international joint venture or licensing structures
(e.g., the Sun IS Solar Energy Ltd. joint venture, the " _Israel JV_ ")) if
the Surviving Company facilitates the provision of modules for installations 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | A Development MW shall be determined as of the Financial
Close for a project: 
---|---|--- 


     | i. | " _Financial Close_ " shall mean: 
---|---|--- 



     | 1. |

The full, or partial in the event of a staged-project, financial closing
pursuant to a project finance transaction (e.g., sale-leaseback;  

---|---|--- 



 

3  cash-sale; partnership flip; term debt facility (whether system is kept on
our books or sold)) occurring after January 1, 2010 and on or prior to
December 31, 2010  

---|--- 



     | 2. | A Development MW shall also count for the purpose of this
earnout in the event such Financial Close occurs in January 2011, but only to
the extent of the percentage of installation completion for such project as
of 12/31/2010 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | For the avoidance of doubt, a project will be deemed fully
completed when a final building permit from the municipality, or comparable
permit, is obtained  
---|---|--- 



     | ii. | A project that includes both a partial sale and a build and
hold component (i.e., where a portion, but not all, of the equity is sold to a
third-party and where the decision to hold the project on the companys
balance sheet was part of the project plan) shall be divided between the GPM
Test and IRR Test below based on the percentage of such project sold and/or
retained by Surviving Company  
---|---|--- 



     | c. | Module costs 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | For the purpose of the GPM Test and IRR Test below (and other
than with respect to projects developed pursuant to Section IV below), a
photovoltaic module will be priced at $[*] per watt. 
---|---|--- 



     | 1. | For the purposes of calculating the GPM Test or IRR test,
when projects are outside the U.S., the $[*] per watt module cost shall be
converted into the applicable currency at the exchange rate as of the signing
date of the Agreement, as published in the Wall Street Journal. 
---|---|--- 



     | ii. | Surviving Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain modules in a manner consistent with the Module Supply Plan (as
provided in Schedule 1.12)  
---|---|--- 



     | d. | " _Earnout Adjustment_ " 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | Notwithstanding the GPM Test of [*]% and IRR Test of [*]%, to
the extent the GPM Test or IRR Test (as defined below) yield a result less
than [*]% and [*]%, respectively (but not less than [*]% and [*]%,
respectively), the Development MWs, that are included in the Aggregate
Qualified Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects shall be calculated
pursuant to the following formula: 
---|---|--- 



     | 1. | For the GPM Test: Development MWs-[(1-(Actual GPM/[*]%)) *
[*] * Development MWs] = the " _Revised Development MWs_ "  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | For the IRR Test: Development MWs-[1-(Actual IRR/[*]%)) * [*]
* Development MWs] = the " _Revised Development MWs_ "  
---|---|--- 



     | 3. | E.g., assuming 150MW at a [*]% GM achieved, would result in:
150  [(1-([*]/[*])) * [*] * 150 = [*]MW 
---|---|--- 
 



 

4 ---|---|--- 



     | a. | The " _GPM Test_ ": The cumulative number of Development MWs
that in the aggregate achieve a GPM of => [*]% 
---|---|--- 


     | b. | Development MWs subject to the GPM Test shall include any
project sold in a cash-sale, or sale-leaseback transaction, to a third-party
(collectively, " _Project Sales_ ") 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | " _GPM_ " = Development Margin / Sale Proceeds 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | " _Development Margin_ " is the difference between the Sale
Proceeds and the COGS 
---|---|--- 


     | 1. | Development Margin shall also include: 
---|---|--- 



     | a. | License fees from Israel JV and similar JV (with less than
50% Surviving Company control)/license fee structures (this royalty amount
would go into the numerator of the GPM calculation) 
---|---|--- 



     | b. | The amount by which actual Surviving Company 2010 SGandA is
more than or less than $[*], as a downward or upward adjustment, respectively;
_provided, however_ , that the $[*] SGandA amount for the purpose herein shall
be adjusted accordingly due to capitalization decisions or accounting changes
that differ from Surviving Companys 2010 Business Plan; _and provided
further_  that this clause (b) shall not have the effect of reducing the
Development Margin unless the Representatives have agreed that such reduction
is consistent with achieving the Maximum Earnout Target

7 _Schedule 5.10_

_OPERATION OF SURVIVING COMPANY DURING THE EARNOUT PERIOD_

(a) Except as Parent and the Representatives may otherwise agree in writing,
from the Closing Date through and including the last day of the Earnout
Period, Parent shall cause Surviving Company to, and Surviving Company shall,
operate in the Ordinary Course of Business consistent with the conduct of the
Companys Business prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the ability of the
Surviving Company to achieve the Maximum Earnout Target amounts, which would
result, absent any allowed indemnification claims under Article 7, in the
payment by Parent of the full Earnout Consideration (i.e., the full $89
million) by virtue of the Surviving Company having completed 150 MW of
Installed Projects by the end of the Earnout Period (the " _Maximum Earnout
Target")_. It is the express intent of the Parties that the Surviving Company
be operated, consistent with this Schedule 5.10 and Section 5.10 of the
Agreement, in such a manner during the Earnout Period as to facilitate the
ability of the Surviving Company to achieve the Maximum Earnout Target. During
the Earnout Period, again consistent with this Schedule 5.10 and Section 5.10
of the Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall take, agree
to take, or commit to take, or fail to take, directly or indirectly, any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in Surviving Companys
inability to achieve the Maximum Earnout Target unless to do so is otherwise
commercially reasonable (and not done with the intention of impacting the
Surviving Companys ability to achieve the Maximum Earnout Target).
Without limiting the foregoing, during the Earnout Period, except as Parent
and the Representatives may otherwise agree in writing, from the Closing Date
through and including the last day of the Earnout Period, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not permit the Surviving Company to, and
the Surviving Company shall not:

(i) mortgage, otherwise encumber or subject to any senior or first priority
Lien any of the Surviving Companys properties or assets, and not otherwise
encumber or subject to any Lien solar projects or assets intended to be
financed by sale-leaseback, cash sale, partnership flip or debt financings,
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Surviving Company;

(ii) enter into any binding contract or agreement related to any commercial
development of a power plant or project that will utilize any of the sources
of financing to be provided or arranged by Parent for Surviving Companys
under this Schedule 5.10 and Section 5.10 of the Agreement, including without
limitation the working capital (including SGandA expense funding), or project
finance facilities of, or to be made available to, the Surviving Company, and
the Parties hereby agree that no such project shall be included in the
Earnout calculation; _provided, however_ , that if Parent does enter into any
such binding contract or agreement (or requires the Surviving Company to do
so), the Parties agree that (A) such project shall not utilize any of the
sources of financing described above, and (B) the work or efforts required by
employees of the Surviving Company to effect such transactions, in the
aggregate, if any, shall be of a magnitude such that they do not interfere in
any material respect with the Surviving Companys efforts to achieve the
Maximum Earnout Target;

(iii) except with the consent of the Representatives, terminate or demote
other than for Cause any two of the four employees set forth on _Schedule
5.10A_ (each an " _Earnout Key Employee_ );  _provided that_ "Cause" for this
purpose shall mean when used in connection with the termination of a Earnout
Key Employee, the termination of the Earnout Key Employee by the Parent or
Surviving Company on account of (i) the failure of the Earnout Key Employee
to make a good faith effort to substantially perform his duties (other than
any such failure due to the 



 

8  Earnout Key Employees disability) or Participants insubordination with
respect to a specific directive of the Earnout Key Employees officer to which
the Earnout Key Employee reports directly or indirectly; (ii) Earnout Key
Employees dishonesty, gross negligence in the performance of his duties or
engaging in willful misconduct, which in the case of any such gross
negligence, has caused or is reasonably expected to result in direct or
indirect material injury to the Surviving Company or Parent; (iii) breach by
Earnout Key Employee of any material provision of any written agreement with
the Surviving Company or Parent or material violation of any material Company
policy applicable to the Earnout Key Employee; (iv) Earnout Key Employees
commission of a crime that constitutes a felony or other crime of moral
turpitude or fraud; or (v) material neglect or negligence in the performance
of such Earnout Key Employees duties, obligations and responsibilities;
_provided, however_ , that such Earnout Key Employees shall be provided with
at least 10 business days advance written notice and an opportunity to
cure such breaches or problems as described in Subsections (i), (iii) and (v)
above;

(iv) establish any compensation or other benefit arrangements that would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of impairing in any material respect
the Surviving Companys employees motivation to apply their best efforts to
achieve the full Maximum Earnout Target or breach Section 5.10; _provided,
however_ , that the parties agree that so long as (i) the salaries at the
Effective Time and the Inducement Grants for such employees are maintained
(and not decreased or increased during the Earnout Period (except as may be
permitted in clause (ii) hereof)) and (ii) unless 80MW of Aggregate Qualified
Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects are achieved pursuant to the
Earnout, no additional compensation is provided to the Earnout Key Employees
during the Earnout Period and for a period of one year thereafter, other than
(x) the compensation in place as of the Effective Time, including without
limitation the Inducement Grants, (y) normal vesting of equity compensation
and contractual bonuses and (z) such other adjustments or increases generally
applicable to other Parent executives in comparable positions, this covenant
shall be deemed met;

(v) reorganize, consolidate or otherwise take steps to transfer any portion of
the Surviving Companys business to an entity other than the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries or to expand, alter or change the type or nature
of the Surviving Companys business from the business conducted by the
Surviving Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; 

(vi) unreasonably require the Surviving Company to cut staff, capital
expenditures and general and administrative expenses or take other actions
that are not commercially reasonable (if the same would be inconsistent with
the Companys practices prior to the Effective Time) and/or a prudent business
practice, _provided, however,_ that it is not reasonably foreseeable that
such actions would materially undermine the Surviving Companys efforts and
ability to achieve the Maximum Earnout Targets;

(vii) require or allow the Surviving Company to engage in any activity for the
intended purpose of increasing the long term growth of the Business at the
expense of achieving the Maximum Earnout Targets, except as Parent and the
Representatives may otherwise agree in writing, which agreement could include
credit towards or adjustment of one or more Earnout targets or thresholds;

(viii) materially change, modify or alter the Surviving Companys pricing,
marketing, sales, financing or operations in such a manner as would
reasonably be expected to hinder or impair in any material respect its
achievement of the Maximum Earnout Target (unless not to do the same would be
commercially unreasonable); and



 

9 (ix) compete with the Surviving Company for project
development opportunities; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained
herein shall prevent Parent from (A) continuing to participate in its existing
joint venture with Q-Cells International or similar joint ventures or (B)
investing or providing capital to companies engaged in project development;
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in respect of any
new business development opportunities not in Parents current pipeline or
currently under consideration by Parent, the Surviving Company shall have a
right of first refusal with regard to any Parent photovoltaic pipeline
acquisitions, or Parent corporate acquisitions primarily valued based on the
photovoltaic project pipeline, in each case for the acquisition of projects
or pipeline only in the United States (which right of first refusal shall
include the right to negotiate with Parent about the acquisition, including
the terms, such as financing terms, thereof).

(b) In addition, during the Earnout Period, Parent shall:

(i) fund (by way of contribution of cash for common equity) the Surviving
Companys Business Plan for its planned level of SGandA of $[*] in 2010,
subject to Section II of Schedule 1.12(i), accounting adjustments to $[*]
amount; for the avoidance of doubt, Parents funding of such SGandA expense
shall be a separate and distinct obligation from, and in addition to,
Parents obligations to provide capital investment funds or arrange revolving
credit pursuant to Subsections (ii) and (iii) below; provided, further, that
Parents failure to fund less than the $[*] SGandA target but in no event less
than 90% of such target shall not result in automatic MW credit for the
earnout but instead shall be accounted for in sub-section II(c)(i)(1)(b) of
the earnout methodology below;

(ii) fund (by way of contribution of cash for common equity) not less than an
aggregate of One Hundred Million ($100,000,000) in working capital to the
Surviving Company, in such increments as are requested by the Surviving
Company, subject to such internal controls and financial policies and
procedures as are consistent with the Parents controls, policies
and procedures regarding capital distributions to its Subsidiaries, and
consistent with the Business Plan, with such funding to be provided within
five (5) Business Days of the Surviving Companys request but, in any event no
later than (A) Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) on the Closing Date (in
excess of any amount used by Parent to pay off the Companys note with HSH),
(B) Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) no later than January 2, 2010
and (C) Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) by April 1, 2010;

(iii) if the need for such facility is required by the Business Plan and it
is commercially reasonable for Parent to do so, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and make available to the Surviving Company a revolver or
working capital facility (which revolver or working capital facility would be
either a portion of Parents facility or a separate Surviving Company facility
on similar terms) from a bank or financial institution suitable to the scale
of the Surviving Companys business, as set forth in the Business Plan, in
order to achieve the Maximum Earnout Target;

(iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Surviving
Company, where prudent, advisable or in the best interests of Parent and the
Surviving Company to do so, to provide or fund additional project financing or
project equity or otherwise provide additional credit support in connection
with government loan guarantee programs; _provided, however_ , that in no
event pursuant to this Schedule 5.10 and Section 5.10 of the Agreement shall
Parent be required to provide parent guaranties except for (A) performance
guaranties of operations and maintenance contracts consistent with the past
practices of the Surviving Company prior to the Effective Time or (B)
additional credit support in connection with 



 

10  government loan guarantee programs, where prudent and advisable; and
_provided, further_ , that in no event pursuant to this Schedule 5.10 and
Section 5.10 of the Agreement shall Parent be required to provide letters of
credit in connection with renewable energy credit contracts or EPC contracts
except where such letters of credit are (A) consistent with the past practices
of the Surviving Company prior to the Effective Time and (B) necessary to
obtain a specific project or projects; and

(v) provide commercially reasonable assistance to Surviving Company to obtain
modules, consistent with the Module Supply Plan agreed by the parties prior to
Closing, as mutually agreed and updated during the Earnout Period;

(c) During the Earnout Period the Surviving Company and Parent shall provide
to the Representatives updates no less frequently than monthly providing in
reasonable detail information regarding the operation and result of the
Surviving Company, the outstanding MW pipeline and MW backlog, the total MWs
of installed projects during the prior calendar month and the total MWs of
installed projects that satisfied the IRR Test and GPM Test during the prior
calendar month, together with any other information reasonably necessary to
allow the Representatives to assess the Surviving Companys progress towards
achievement of the Maximum Earnout Target, and Parent, its Subsidiaries and
the Surviving Companys compliance with the covenants set forth in this
_Section 5.10_. If the Representatives believe that there has been the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, occurrence or circumstance that in
the Representatives reasonable good faith judgment is reasonably likely to
have a material effect on the achievement or non-achievement of the Maximum
Earnout Target, or in the event the Representatives disagree with the
calculations in a monthly report from the Parent or that the Representatives
believe that there has been a material breach of any covenant set forth in
_Section _5.10, (an " _Alleged Earnout Covenant Breach_ "), then the dispute
resolution and arbitration provisions of Section 5.10(e) below shall be
utilized to achieve resolution of such Alleged Earnout Breach, which
resolution could included extension of the Earnout Period for an appropriate
period of time or the acceleration of some or all of the entire amount of the
Earnout Consideration (i.e. Eighty Nine Million Dollars ($89,000,000)).

(d) If, during the Earnout Period, there is (i) a Sale of the Company or (ii)
if there is (x) a Parent Acquisition, then the Maximum Earnout Target shall be
deemed to have been met as of the date of the Sale of the Company or Parent
Acquisition (as the case may be) and the full Earnout Consideration (i.e.
Eighty Nine Million Dollars ($89,000,000) shall be due and payable pursuant to
the payment and allocation provisions of Article 1. As used in this Schedule
5.10, the term "Sale of the Company" means any transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which any Person other than Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent acquires (Y) units or membership
interests of the Surviving Company possessing the voting power to elect a
majority of the Surviving Companys board of directors (whether by merger,
consolidation, reorganization, combination, sale or transfer of the Companys
units or membership interests or otherwise) or (Z) all or substantially all of
the Surviving Companys assets determined on a consolidated basis. As used in
this Schedule 5.10, "Parent Acquisition" means any (A) any acquisition or
purchase, direct or indirect, of 50% or more of the consolidated assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries or over 50% of any class of equity or voting
securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute more than 50% of the consolidated assets of
Parent, (B) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any Person (including as such term
is defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors of such Person)
beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute more than 50% of the consolidated assets of Parent, (C)
a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of
substantially all the assets, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction 



 

11  involving Parent or any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute more than 50% of the consolidated assets of Parent
or (D) a change in the composition in more than 50% of the directors,
excluding directors whose nomination was approved by a majority of the
existing directors (and any previously approved directors).

(e) Disputes. In the event any dispute arises between at least two of the
Representatives and Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries which expressly
includes the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries and the respective
successors and assigns of each of the foregoing) the Company (each an "
_Earnout Party_ ") in connection with the Earnout or any of the covenants,
agreements or calculations (including any calculation of the
Aggregate Qualified Adjusted MWs of Financially Closed Projects, Earnout
Statement or the Preliminary Earnout Calculation) or any of its component
parts) set forth on this Schedule 5.10, the Earnout Parties agree that such
dispute will be resolved as follows: 

(i) _Mediation_. The Earnout Parties shall first attempt to resolve the
dispute by themselves through the participation in such endeavor of the Chief
Executive Officer of Parent and the Representatives. In the event that the
Earnout Parties are unable to resolve such dispute themselves within ten
business days that an Earnout Party has provided notice to the other Earnout
Parties of such dispute (the "Initial Period"), then, within three (3)
Business Days following the end the Initial Period, the Earnout Parties shall
submit it to non-binding mediation through a neutral mediator selected by
mutual agreement. In the event that the Earnout Parties are unable to resolve
such dispute by mediation within fifteen (15) business days following such
submission (the "Mediation Period"), it shall be resolved by
binding arbitration as set forth below.

(ii) _Rules_. Except as expressly provided herein to the contrary,
the arbitration proceeding shall be conducted under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the
time a demand for arbitration is made. To the extent that there is any
conflict between the rules of the American Arbitration Association and this
Schedule 5.10, this Schedule 5.10 shall govern and determine the rights of the
Earnout Parties.

(iii) _Location; Selection of Arbitrators_. The arbitration will take place in
New York, New York, before a single arbitrator which arbitrator shall have
experience in matters and industries relevant to such dispute, provided,
however that if the amount in controversy exceeds $25 million, then either the
Parent or the Representatives shall have the right to require that three
arbitrators be used. In the event that the Earnout Parties cannot agree on a
single arbitrator within five (5) Business Days following the end of the
Mediation Period, then the arbitrator shall be selected as follows: either
Earnout Party may request the American Arbitration Association to provide a
list of five (5) proposed arbitrators, all of whom must be retired judges
with at least ten (10) years of judicial experience, but who may still be
active in the practice of law; _provided_ that any such prospective arbitrator
shall have experience in earnout matters relevant to such dispute. If the
Earnout Parties are unable to mutually select an arbitrator from such list,
the Earnout Parties to such dispute shall then take turns crossing off the
names one at time until one name remains, who shall thereupon be appointed
the arbitrator. The Earnout Parties to such dispute shall select by lot which
of them strikes the first name from the list of proposed arbitrators. If the
person selected in this method to be the arbitrator declines or is otherwise
unavailable to serve as the arbitrator of the dispute, the arbitrator shall be
selected from the same list of proposed arbitrators selected in the reverse
order to which those proposed arbitrators names were struck from the list
until one of those individuals elected to be the arbitrator accepts the
appointment and is able to serve as the arbitrator.



 

12 (iv) _Arbitration Procedures_. The arbitrator selected in the manner set
forth herein (the " _Arbitrator_ ") shall be requested to honor the intention
of the Earnout Parties hereto to resolve the dispute quickly and in accordance
with the intent of the parties expressed in this Schedule 5.10. All decisions
shall be made with this intention in mind. The decision of the Arbitrator
shall be final and binding on all Earnout Parties, their successors and
assigns as applicable. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Arbitrator shall determine the manner in which the arbitration proceeding is
conducted, including, without limitation, the time and place of all hearings,
the order or presentation of evidence and all of the questions that arise with
respect to the arbitration proceeding. The arbitration shall entitle both
parties to conduct discovery consistent with the applicable rules of civil
procedure for federal courts situated in New York, New York. If deemed
necessary by the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall have the right to retain a
nationally recognized accounting firm to aid in the Arbitrators consideration
of the dispute which accounting firm must be reasonably acceptable to both
Earnout Parties. The Arbitrator shall be required to determine all issues in
accordance with Delaware law. The arbitration shall be conducted in "baseball
arbitration" style, whereby each Earnout Party shall submit their proposed
result, and the Arbitrator may only choose one or the other proposed
result. Either Earnout Party to the arbitration may seek a judgment from a
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the award of the Arbitrator.

(v) _Costs_. The cost of arbitration, including administrative fees, fees for
recording a transcript, and the Arbitrators fees, shall be borne equally by
the Earnout Parties to the arbitration. Each Earnout Party shall bear the
costs of the fees charged such Earnout Party by its own counsel; _provided,
however_ , that the Arbitrator shall have the discretion and the right, but
not the obligation, to award reasonable attorneys fees to the Earnout Party
determined by the Arbitrator to be the prevailing party (which shall be the
Earnout Party whose proposed result is chosen by the Arbitrator).
