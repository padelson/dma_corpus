ARTICLE III

 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

 

3.1 _Merger Consideration_ _; Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of the Company, each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time other than Excluded Shares (such shares of Company Common
Stock, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive
cash in the amount of $23.04 per share (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

3.2 _Conversion of Shares of Company Common Stock_. By virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any
capital stock of the Company, all of the Eligible Shares shall represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III, shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and each certificate formerly representing any of the
Eligible Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each book-entry account
formerly representing any non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-
Entry Share_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

3.3 _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or any holder of
any Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have pursuant to Section 4.7.

 

3.4 _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Parties, each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time.

 



-3- 3.5 _Treatment of Equity Awards_. At the Effective Time, the Company Equity
Awards will receive the following treatment, in each case in accordance with
and subject to the terms set forth in Sections 3.5(a)-(f) and the other
provisions of this Agreement: (i) each Vested Company Option that is not
designated as a Rollover Equity Award by its holder will be converted into a
right to promptly receive a cash payment based on its spread value; (ii) the
spread value of each Vested Company Option that is designated by its holder as
a Rollover Equity Award will be converted to common stock of Parent (or a
parent of Parent); (iii) each Unvested Company Option will be converted to a
cash award, based on its spread value, that remains subject to the same
vesting schedule that applied immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iv)
each Company RSU will be converted to a cash award, based on the Merger
Consideration, that remains subject to the same vesting schedule that applied
immediately prior to the Effective Time; (v) each Company P-RSU will be
converted to a cash award, based on the Merger Consideration and the actual
performance of such Company P-RSU through the Effective Time, that otherwise
remains subject to the same vesting schedule that applied immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and (vi) each Company DSU will be converted into a
right to promptly receive a cash payment, based on the Merger Consideration.
With respect to the foregoing, the spread value of a Company Option will be
determined by subtracting the per share exercise price of such Company Option
from the Merger Consideration, and any Company Option for which the per share
exercise price is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration will be
cancelled for no consideration.

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding vested
option (or vested portion thereof) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(a " _Vested Company Option_ "), other than any Rollover Equity Awards, shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Vested Company Option to
receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective
Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock of such Vested Company Option less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment and (ii) each outstanding
unvested option (or unvested portion thereof) to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (an " _Unvested Company Option_ " and, together with the Vested
Company Options, the " _Company Options_ ") under the Stock Plans shall,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Unvested Company Option to
receive an amount in cash, without interest (a " _Company Option Deferred
Cash Award_ ") equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such Unvested
Company Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Option which has
an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each such Company Option Deferred Cash Award will be subject to the same
vesting schedule and other terms and conditions (other than with respect to
exercise) applicable to the corresponding Unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and be paid on the applicable vesting date.

 



-4- (b) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit that is subject only to service-based vesting conditions (a " _Company
RSU_ ") under the Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest (a " _Company RSU
Deferred Cash Award_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such Company
RSU Deferred Cash Award will be subject to the same vesting schedule and
other terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Company P-RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit that is subject to performance-based vesting conditions (a " _Company
P-RSU_") under the Stock Plans shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder of such Company P-RSU to receive an amount in cash, without
interest (a " _Company P-RSU Deferred Cash Award_" and together with the
Company Option Deferred Cash Awards and the Company RSU Deferred Cash Awards,
" _Replacement Deferred Cash Awards_ ") equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company P-RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time based on the actual performance through the
Effective Time as determined by the compensation committee of the Company
Board (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") _multiplied by_ (y) the
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent there
are any Company P-RSUs for which the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Company P-RSU as determined in accordance with clause (x) of the
preceding sentence is zero, such Company P-RSU shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time for no consideration or payment. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each such Company P-RSU Deferred
Cash Award will be subject to the same vesting schedule and other terms and
conditions applicable to the corresponding Company P-RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(d) _Company DSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding deferred stock
unit (a " _Company DSU_ ") under the Companys Director Deferred Compensation
Plan, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company
DSU to receive (without interest), as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
after the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company DSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment; _provided_ , that,
with respect to any Company DSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to
be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time
permitted under the Companys Director Deferred Compensation Plan and a
participants deferral elections that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

 



-5- (e) _Company Equity Payments_. Any payments to which holders of Company
Options, Company RSUs, Company P-RSUs and Company DSUs (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Awards_ ") are entitled to pursuant to Section 3.5(a), Section
3.5(b), Section 3.5(c) and Section 3.5(d), respectively (collectively, the "
_Company Equity Payments_ ") shall be made through the Surviving Corporations
payroll (except in the case of Company DSUs) and in accordance with Section
3.5(a), Section 3.5(b), Section 3.5(c) and Section 3.5(d). Parent and Merger
Sub shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation has an amount in cash, or
immediately available borrowing capacity, sufficient to pay all amounts
required by the foregoing sentence.

(f) _Company Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Company Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall

ARTICLE IV

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION; PROCEDURES FOR SURRENDER

4.1 _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, or as promptly as possible
thereafter, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with a paying agent
selected by Parent and approved by the Company (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of Eligible Shares, an aggregate amount of cash
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under Section 3.1 (such cash
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The paying agent
agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for
in this Agreement. The Exchange Fund may be invested by the Paying Agent as
reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
investment shall in all events be limited to (i) direct short-term obligations
of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by, the United States government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, (ii) certificates of deposit or bank repurchase agreements of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion or (iii) AAA rated 2A-7
fixed NAV money market funds (or those of similar quality), or a combination
of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months. To the extent
that there are losses with respect to such deposits, a default of an
applicable bank or for any other reason any amount in the Exchange Fund is
below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration and the other payments contemplated by this Article IV,
Parent

 



-6-  and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or restore, or cause
the replacement or restoration, of the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through
such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at
all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by this Article IV.
Any interest and other income resulting from such deposit may become part of
the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
Section 3.1 may, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2 _Procedure_ _s for Surrender_.

 

(a) With respect to Certificates, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to provide
or make available to each holder of record of each such Certificate (i) notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a letter of
transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to a Certificate shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate
as provided in Section 4.5) to the Paying Agent (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), and (iii) instructions for surrendering a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 4.5) to the
Paying Agent. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 4.5)
together with a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and such
other documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to promptly provide or
make available to each holder of record of any such Certificate in exchange
therefore a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.6) of (A) the number of Eligible Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate
as provided in Section 4.5) _multiplied by_ (B) the Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

(b) With respect to each Book-Entry Share not held through DTC (each, a "
_Non-DTC Book-Entry Share_"), promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to provide or make available to each holder of
record of a Non-DTC Book-Entry Share (i) a notice advising such holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.6) of (A) the
number of Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares held by such holder _multiplied by_ (B)
the Merger Consideration, and the Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled.

 

(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company
shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent and DTC to
ensure that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the
Closing Date (or if Closing occurs after 8:30 a.m. (California Time) on the
Closing Date, on the first Business Day after the Closing Date), upon
surrender of Eligible Shares held of record by DTC or its nominees in
accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures, the Merger Consideration
for each such Eligible Share that each such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article IV. 

(d) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable for Eligible
Shares pursuant to this Article IV.

 



-7- 4.3 _Transfers_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of the Companys capital
stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of the Companys
capital stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Agreement.

(b) With respect to Certificates, in the event of a transfer of ownership of
any Certificate that is not registered in the transfer books of the Company
as of the Effective Time, a check for the cash (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.6) to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate, may be issued or paid to such a transferee if
the Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each
case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Paying Agent.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.3, each Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article IV.

(c) With respect to Book-Entry Shares, payment of the Merger Consideration,
payable pursuant to this Article IV, shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock transfer books of the
Company as of the Effective Time.

 

4.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any deposit of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of the Eligible Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of Eligible Shares who has not
theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation for delivery of the Merger Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article IV.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Any Per Share Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

4.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will, subject to Section 4.7 in respect of any Certificate representing
Excluded Shares, issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article IV,
had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

 



-8- 4.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and timely remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable.

4.7 _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock owned
by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting
Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section
262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to demand
for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC

any other section or subsection (other than representations and warranties in
Section 5.2 [ _Capital Structure of the Company_ ]) to which the relevance of

Company Reports will be deemed to modify or qualify the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.1 [ _Organization, Good Standing and

Violations; Certain Contracts, Etc._ ], Section 5.11 [ _Takeover Statutes_ ]
__ and Section 5.20 [ _Brokers and Finders_ ], the Company hereby represents

-9- 5.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Section 5.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the name,
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization (as applicable) and entity form
of each Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X

of the Companys Subsidiaries is in violation of its Organizational Documents
in any respect except, in the case of the Companys Subsidiaries, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

5.2  _Capital Structur_ _e of the Company._

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 200,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, of which 110,711,498 shares were issued and
outstanding as of the close of business on April 4, 2018 (the "
_Capitalization Date_ "), and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which no shares were issued and outstanding as of
the close of business on the Capitalization Date. All of the outstanding

issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The only shares of Company Common Stock
reserved for issuance as of the Capitalization Date, were 13,883,391 shares of

of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company, free and clear of any pledge, lien, charge, security
interest, adverse right or other encumbrance (an " _Encumbrance_ ," and any

preemptive rights or any restriction on the right to vote, transfer, sell or
otherwise dispose of such outstanding capital stock and (ii) not subject to or
issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right of first

debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter. Since the
Capitalization Date through the date of this Agreement, neither the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has (i) issued any Company Securities or incurred
any obligation to make any payments to any Person based on the price or value
of any Company Securities or (2) established a record date for, declared, set
aside for payment or paid any dividend on, or made any other distribution in
respect of any Company Securities.

 



-10- (b) Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and
complete listing of all outstanding Company Equity Awards as of the close of
business on April 4, 2018, setting forth the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each Company Equity Award and the employee
identification number, grant date and exercise price with respect to each
Company Equity Award, as applicable. Except as set forth in Section 5.2(a) or

date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, there
are no outstanding shares of (i) capital stock or voting securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock, or
cash payment in lieu of a share of capital stock, or voting securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation
rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements,
calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, dispose or sell any shares of capital
stock, or cash payment in lieu of a share of capital stock, or other
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) restricted shares,
performance shares, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar
securities or rights with respect to the capital stock of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iv) any securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, valued by reference to, directly or
indirectly, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding (the
items described in the foregoing being referred to collectively as the "
_Company Securities_ "). Upon any issuance of any shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such shares of Company
Common Stock will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and free and clear of any Encumbrance. There are no voting
trusts, proxies, or other similar agreements or understandings to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound with respect to the disposition or voting of any
shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

5.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, subject
only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on such matter at
the Stockholders Meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the "
_Requisite Company Vote_ "). The only vote of holders of any class of capital
stock of the Company necessary to adopt this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the Transactions (under applicable Law, the Companys
Organizational Documents or otherwise) is the Requisite Company Vote. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes
a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general
equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 



-11- (b) The Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that the Merger is fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders (other
than the Parent, Merger Sub and any of Parents other direct or indirect
Subsidiaries), approved and declared advisable the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions and resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Recommendation_ "),
(ii) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock for their adoption and (iii) received the opinion of its
financial advisor, Qatalyst Partners LP, to the effect that as of the date of
such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various assumptions,
qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be received pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
this Agreement by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Parent or any Affiliates of Parent), is fair, from a financial point of view
to such holders.

5.4 _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts, Etc._

any required to be made or obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with or from any Governmental Entity or Industry Association, in connection
with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Transactions, except those that the failure to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay or impair the consummation of the
Transactions.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Transactions will not, constitute or
result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any material respect,
(ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,
a termination (or right of termination) of or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of an Encumbrance on
any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any
Material Contract, Lease or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of
this Agreement and consummation of the Transactions) compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.4(a), under any Law or Industry Association
Rule to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject or (iii) any
change in the rights or obligations of any party under any Material
Contract or require any consent or approval thereunder, except, in the case
of clause (ii) or (iii) above, as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



-12- 5.5 _Company Reports; Financial Statements_ _; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act since October 31, 2015 (the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements,
reports and documents filed or furnished to the SEC and those filed or
furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including any
amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports,
at the time of its filing or being furnished, complied, or if not yet filed
or furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed
with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Each required form, report and document containing
financial statements that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC by the
Company since the Applicable Date was accompanied by the certifications
required to be filed or submitted by the Companys principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. None of the Company, any current executive officer of the
Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any former executive officer of
the Company has received written notice from any Governmental Entity
challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing of such certifications made with respect to the Company Reports filed
prior to the date hereof. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent correct and complete copies of
all comment letters received by the Company from the SEC since the Applicable
Date relating to the Company Reports, together with all written responses of
the Company thereto. Except as set forth in Section 5.5(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any
comment letters received by the Company from the SEC relating to the Company
Reports and the Company has not received any notice from the SEC that any of
the Company Reports is the subject of any ongoing review, outstanding comment
or outstanding investigation by the SEC.

(c) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of

 



-13-  financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and
expenditures are executed in accordance with the authorization of Company
management, and (iii) that any unauthorized use, acquisition or disposition
of the Companys assets that would materially affect the Companys financial
statements would be detected or prevented in a timely manner.

 

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly presents, or, in the case of Company Reports filed
after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, equity and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into
the Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents, or in the case of Company Reports filed after the date of this
Agreement, will fairly present the results of operations, retained earnings
(loss) and changes in financial position, as applicable, of such companies for
the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,
to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that will not individually or
in the aggregate be material in amount or effect to the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein or in the
notes thereto. Since December 31, 2015, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent registered
accountant has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency
or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting utilized by the Company, (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves the management or other employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in the Companys
preparation of financial statements or internal control over financial
reporting, or (iii) any claim or allegation regarding any of the foregoing.

(e) The Company, based on its most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, has not identified any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting. Since the Applicable Date, no material complaints,
allegations, assertions or claims from any source regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls or auditing matters, or regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters, have been received by the Company or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm.

5.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since October 31, 2017, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than in the Ordinary Course,
and there has not been any Effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, since October 31, 2017 through
the date of this Agreement, the Company has not taken any actions which, had
such actions been taken after the date of this Agreement, would have required
the prior written consent of Parent pursuant to Sections 7.1(b)(iii), (vi),
(vii), (x), (xi), (xvi) and (xviii).

 



-14- 5.7 _Litigation and Liabilities_.

 

(a) There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any present or
former officer, director or employee, in their capacities as such, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Except for obligations and liabilities (i) reflected or reserved against
in the Companys consolidated balance sheets (and the notes thereto) included
in the Company Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)
incurred in the Ordinary Course since October 31, 2017, or (iii) incurred in
connection with this Agreement, there are no obligations or liabilities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any Governmental
Order that restricts in any material respect the manner in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries conduct their businesses, that otherwise is material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or that would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay or impair the consummation of the Transactions.

5.8 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Section 5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
correct list of each material U.S. Company Benefit Plan. No later than thirty
(30) days after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide a
complete and correct list of each material Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan as of
the date of this Agreement and indicate (i) each Non-U.S. Company Benefit
Plan that is a defined benefit plan (as defined in ERISA, whether or not
subject to ERISA) and (ii) each Non-U.S. Company Benefit Plan that provides
post-termination or post-retirement welfare benefits beyond those required
under Section 4980B of the Code for which the covered Person pays the full
cost of coverage). With respect to each U.S. Company Benefit Plan, the
Company has made available to Parent and, with respect to each Non-U.S.

ability of Parent to consummate the Transactions.

 



-27- (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and

-28- 6.7 _Financing_. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and
correct copy of an executed commitment letter of even date herewith (the "
_Equity Commitment Letter_ ") from the Equity Financing Source, pursuant to
which the Equity Financing Source has committed to provide, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, equity financing for the Transactions
in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ "). The
Equity Commitment Letter provides that (i) the Company is a third-
party beneficiary thereof and (ii) subject in all respects to Section 10.6,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or the Equity Financing Source will oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in
connection with the exercise of such third-party beneficiary rights. The
Equity Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered to the Company, is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub
and the Equity Financing Source, fully and specifically enforceable against
the parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception.

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and accurate copy of an
executed commitment letter of even date herewith, and the executed fee letter
related thereto of even date herewith (except that the fee amounts, pricing
caps, other economic terms and other "market flex" provisions may be redacted
so long as no redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount
(including the net cash proceeds to Parent), conditionality, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing, as hereinafter defined), together with any
related exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other
agreements (collectively and as amended from time to time, the " _Debt
Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "
_Financing Commitment Letters_ "), pursuant to which the agents, arrangers,
managers, lenders and other entities party thereto (excluding Parent, Merger
Sub or the Guarantors), including the parties to any joinder agreements
joining such parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or parties (excluding
Parent, Merger Sub or Guarantor) to the definitive agreements executed in
connection with the Debt Financing (together with their respective affiliates
and their respective affiliates officers, directors, employees, controlling
persons, agents and Representatives and their respective successors and
assigns, collectively, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ " and, together with
the Equity Financing Source, the " _Financing Source_ ") have committed to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, debt financing
for the Merger and the other Transactions in the aggregate amount set forth
therein (the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the
" _Financing_ "). Any reference in this Agreement to (i) "Equity
Commitment Letter", "Debt Commitment Letter" or "Financing Commitment
Letters" will include such documents as amended or modified in compliance with
the provisions of Section 7.13, and (ii) the "Financing" will include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters as amended or
modified in compliance with the provisions of Section 7.13. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter constitutes the legally valid
and binding obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the commitments set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters are in full force and effect, none of such
commitments has been amended or modified and no such amendment or modification
is contemplated or pending that would not be permitted by Section 7.13; and
(ii) the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn, modified, reduced or rescinded in any respect
and no such withdrawal, modification, reduction or rescission is contemplated
except any reduction of the commitments in accordance with the terms set out
in the Financing Commitment Letters. Other than the Financing Commitment
Letters, as of the date of this Agreement there are

 



-29-  no other agreements, side letters or arrangements to which Parent is a party
relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing that
could affect the availability of the Financing or any portion thereof on the
Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has paid in full any
and all commitment or other fees required by the Financing Commitment Letters
that are due as of the date of this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Financing
Commitment Letters and, as of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure
to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date of this
Agreement, no Financing Source has notified Parent of its intention to
terminate any commitment set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters or not
to provide the Financing. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
(including any "flex" provisions), other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any
conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing to be satisfied
by it, or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to consummate the
Transactions, is not and will not be subject to the receipt by Parent or
Merger Sub of any financing or the consummation of any other transaction.

(d) The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters
are sufficient (after deducting applicable fees, expenses, original issue
discount and similar premiums and charges) to enable Parent to (i) consummate
the Transactions upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pay all
of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of all Eligible Shares in the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement, (iii) pay all amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.5 of this Agreement, (iv) pay all Indebtedness, liabilities and
other obligations of the Company contemplated to be funded by Parent under by
this Agreement, and (v) pay all related fees and expenses associated with the
Transactions or the Financing Commitment Letters incurred by Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates and
required to be paid at the Closing by such party.

 

(e) None of the Guarantors, the Equity Financing Source, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates has entered into any Contract with any
Person (other than a Debt Financing Source) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit
such Person from providing or seeking to provide debt financing to any Person
in connection with a transaction relating to the acquisition of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

6.8 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor or the Equity
Financing Source is entering into this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 (in each case, other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), (b) that the
representations and warranties set forth in Article V as written are true and
correct at and immediately after the Closing and (c) the estimates,
projections or forecasts provided by or on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries to Parent or Merger Sub prior to the date hereof (as may have
been updated in writing prior to the date hereof) have been prepared in good
faith on assumptions that were, and

 



-30-  continue to be, reasonable, at and immediately after the Closing (it being
understood that Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606) shall not affect the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections or forecasts), then, after
giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions (including the Financing
being entered into in connection therewith), the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries would be Solvent.

6.9 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Guarantors have duly executed and delivered the Limited Guarantee to the
Company. As of the date hereof, the Limited Guarantee is in full force and
effect and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception, and has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the part of any Guarantor under the
Limited Guarantee.

6.10 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement to be filed in connection with the Merger and Transactions, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, will at the time of the mailing of the Proxy
Statement and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting contains nor will it
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading.

6.11 _Non-Reliance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself and on behalf of
its Affiliates and Representatives) that Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives (i) have received full access to (A)
such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of

and Representatives, as of the date hereof, have requested to review and (B)

Agreement, (a) none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (or any other
Person) makes, or has made, any representation or warranty (whether express or
implied) relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
businesses, operations, properties, assets, liabilities or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions, including as to the
accuracy or completeness of any such information, and none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives is relying on
any representation or warranty made by the Company or its Representatives
except for the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set
forth in Article V, (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to make any representation or warranty relating to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, operations,
properties, assets, liabilities or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions, and if made, such representation or warranty
has not been, and may not be,

 



-31-  relied upon by parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives as having been authorized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any other Person), and (c) any estimate, projection,
prediction, data, financial information, memorandum, presentation or any other
materials or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives, including any materials or
information made available in the electronic data room hosted by the Company
in connection with the Transactions or in connection with presentations by the
Companys management, and the estimates, projections, forecasts other
forward-looking information, and business plan and cost-related plan
information referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section 6.11, are not and
shall not be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless
and to the extent any such materials or information is expressly the subject
of any express representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Article
V of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge (each for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and Representatives) that it has conducted,
to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the business,
operations and financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this
Section 6.11 in connection with the due diligence investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub
have received and may continue to receive from the Company and its
Subsidiaries certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plan and cost-related plan
information, regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
businesses and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, with which Parent and Merger
Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility
for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as such business plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-
related plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will not commence or threaten
(and each of them agrees that there shall be no basis for) any Proceeding
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto.

and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives shall have the right, directly

pursuant to confidentiality agreements on customary terms no more favorable in
any material respect, individually or in the aggregate, to such Person than

that such confidentiality agreements need not prohibit or restrict the making
or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that (x) the Company
shall not pay, agree to pay or cause to be paid, or reimburse, agree to
reimburse or cause to be reimbursed the expenses of any such Person in
connection with any Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers
or other efforts or attempts that may lead to an Acquisition Proposal), in
each case, without the prior consent of Parent, (y) the Company shall
implement reasonable protections for any competitively sensitive information
or data provided to any such Person who is, or whose Affiliates include, a key
competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as determined by the
Company Board in its judgment); and (z) the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter) make available to Parent any material non-
public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that the Company

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.2, at all times during the
period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX and the Effective Time, except as expressly permitted
by this Section 7.2, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and the directors and officers set forth in Section 7.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, and shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries other Representatives to:

 

(i) at 12:00 a.m. (California Time) on May 25, 2018 (the " _No-Shop Period

Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; (D)
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition

-37- (c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(b) to the contrary, at any time
following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the time, but not after
the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in response to an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (if the Company did not materially violate Section 7.2
with respect to such Person) that the Company Board believes in good faith is
_bona_ _fide_ , the Company may:

 

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor (including non-
public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that such information
has previously been made available to Parent or its Representatives or is made
available to Parent promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after such
information is made available to such Person and that, prior to furnishing any
such information, the Company receives from the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no more favorable
in any material respect, individually or in the aggregate, to the other party
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, _it_ _being_
_understood_ that such confidentiality agreements need not prohibit
or restrict the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,
that (x) the Company shall not pay, agree to pay or cause to be paid, or
reimburse, agree to reimburse or cause to be reimbursed the expenses of any
such Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries,
proposals or offers or other efforts or attempts that may lead to an
Acquisition Proposal), in each case, without the prior written consent of
Parent and (y) the Company shall implement reasonable protections for any
competitively sensitive information or data provided to any such Person who
is, or whose Affiliates include, a key competitor, of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (as determined by the Company Board in its judgment); and

(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clause
(i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that
(A) based on the information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and
(B) failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(d) Except as permitted by Section 7.2(e) and Section 7.2(f), the Company
Board, including any committee thereof, shall not:

 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation with
respect to the Merger in a manner adverse to Parent, (B) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) take any action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer other than an unequivocal recommendation against such offer or
a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act in which the
Company Board

 



-38-  or the Company indicates that the Company Board has not changed the Company
Recommendation or (D) if reasonably requested by in writing by Parent in a
timely manner, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within three (3)
Business Days prior to the Stockholders Meeting (provided, that the Company
Board shall not be required to comply with more than one (1) such request);

 

(ii) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose
to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.2(a) or Section
7.2(c) entered into in compliance with Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(c))
providing for any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ ," and any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

(iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company Board may (A) effect
a Change of Recommendation if (x)(1) a written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board believes in good faith is _bona fide_ and that did not arise
from or in connection with a breach of the obligations set forth in Section
7.2 is received by the Company and is not withdrawn, and the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (2) an Intervening Event has occurred, and (y) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, that failure to take such action in response to such
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (B) take action
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section
9.4(a) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in connection with a
Superior Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Change
of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or Intervening Event or
action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4(a) may not be made
(i) unless the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 7.2(e) and (ii) unless and until the Company
has given Parent written notice of such action five (5) Business Days in
advance (an " _Initial Notice_ "), setting forth in writing that the Company
Board intends to consider whether to take such action and (I) in the case of
a Superior Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and (II) in the case of an Intervening Event, a reasonable
description of such Intervening Event (it being agreed that, in each case,
neither the delivery of such notice by the Company nor any public
announcement thereof that the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, is required to be made under applicable Law
shall constitute a Change of Recommendation). After giving such Initial
Notice and prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or taking such
action to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4(a), the Company
shall, and shall instruct its legal and financial advisors to, negotiate in
good faith with Parent and its Representatives throughout such five (5)
Business Day period (to the

 



-39-  extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of
this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not to effect a Change of
Recommendation or to take such action to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.4(a). At the end of the five (5) Business Day period, prior to
taking action to effect a Change of Recommendation or taking action to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4(a), the Company Board shall
take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in writing and any other information offered by Parent in response to
the Initial Notice, and shall have determined in good faith that (i) in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and (ii) in the case of an Intervening Event,
the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, in each case, if such changes offered in writing were to
be given effect. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2(e)
except that the obligation to give advance written notice (a " _Change Notice_
") with respect thereto as set forth in this Section 7.2(e) shall be reduced
to three (3) Business Days.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective boards of
directors or any committee thereof, from complying with its disclosure
obligations under any Laws, including U.S. federal or state law, with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) if such
disclosure includes a Change of Recommendation or has the substantive effect
of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and (ii) in no
event shall the Company effect, or agree or resolve to effect, a Change of
Recommendation other than in compliance with this Section 7.2.

 

(g) The Company shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or
modify any provision of, or grant permission under or fail to enforce, any
standstill provision in any confidentiality agreement in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal to which the Company is a party that remains in effect
following the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , _that_
, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may waive any such standstill provision to the extent necessary to permit a
third party to make an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(h) On or before the thirty-fifth (35th) day of the Go-Shop Period and within
24 hours following the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall notify
Parent of the material terms and conditions of any proposal or
offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments or
modifications thereof) theretofore received during the Go-Shop Period (which
shall include an copy of such proposal or offer (which copy may be redacted
to omit the identity of the Person making such proposal or offer; provided
that, if requested by Parent, an unredacted copy shall be provided to Parent
promptly following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period) and a summary of any
financing material related thereto (if any)). The Company shall promptly (and,
in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) give written notice to Parent if,
following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, (i) any inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, (ii) any
non-public information is 

 



-40-  requested in connection with any Acquisition Proposal from, or (iii) any
discussions or negotiation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought
to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives,
indicating, in connection with such notice the name of such Person or group
and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including,
if applicable, unredacted copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements, or where no such copies are available,
a reasonably detailed written description thereof) and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours), of the status and material terms of any such
proposals, or offers (including any material amendments thereto) and any
material changes to the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
including any change in the Companys intentions as previously notified.

(i) The Company agrees that any material breach of this Section 7.2 by any of
its directors, officers named in the definition of "Knowledge", Qatalyst
Partners LP or Sullivan and Cromwell LLP (collectively, the " _Specified
Representatives_ ") shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

7.3 _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event within twenty
(20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, a proxy statement in
preliminary form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement,
including any amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ").
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company
and/or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other,
with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use
their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the
SEC with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC
and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed and
mailed as promptly as possible (and in any event, no later than three (3)
Business Days following the later of (i) ten (10) days after the filing of the
preliminary Proxy Statement if the SEC has confirmed to the Company during
such ten (10)-day period that it will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement
(provided that the Company will contact the SEC on the 10th day to confirm no
review) and (ii) the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further
comments thereon or that pursuant to the Exchange Act the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement). The Company and Parent each shall, upon request
by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself,
its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters
as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement. The Company and Parent each agree, as to itself and its respective
Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any
of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



-41- (b) The Company shall provide Parents legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement and any
other documents related to the Stockholders Meeting prior to filing of the
Proxy Statement and any other such documents, including any amendment thereto,
with the applicable Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the
stockholders of the Company. The Company will consider in good faith for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and such other documents related to the
Stockholders Meeting all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by Parent
or its legal counsel, and the Company agrees that all information relating to
Parent and its Subsidiaries included in the Proxy Statement shall be in form
and content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably.

 

7.4 _Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 7.2 of this Agreement, the Company will take, in
accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational Documents, all action
necessary to convene the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, and in any event no later
than thirty (30) days after the filing of the definitive Proxy Statement (but
in no event shall such meeting be required to be held prior to five (5)
Business Days following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period), to consider and
vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and to cause such vote to be taken,
and shall not postpone or adjourn such meeting except (A) if there are not
holders of a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock present or
represented by proxy at the Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum
at the Stockholders Meeting, (B) if the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting by applicable Law, order of Governmental
Entity or a request from the SEC or its staff or (C) if there has been a
Change of Recommendation and the Company Board (or any committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting
in order to give the stockholders of the Company sufficient time to evaluate
any information or disclosure that the Company has disseminated or otherwise
made available to such stockholders, in which case the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting one (1) time, but only for such period as
the Company Board (or such committee) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) is necessary or appropriate to give
the stockholders of the Company sufficient time to evaluate such information
or disclosure, which in any event shall not exceed five (5) Business Days.
Subject to Section 7.2 of this Agreement, the Company Board shall recommend
such adoption and shall take all lawful action to solicit such adoption. In
the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board
makes a Change of Recommendation, the Company nevertheless shall continue to
submit this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company for approval at
the Stockholders Meeting unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Once the Company
has established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting, the Company will
not change such record date or establish a different record date for the
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



-42- (b) The Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, on a timely basis, with the
daily written voting reports it receives concerning proxy solicitation
results for each of the ten (10) Business Days prior to the Stockholders
Meeting and (ii) to use its reasonable efforts to give written notice to
Parent one (1) Business Day prior to the Stockholders Meeting and on the day
of, but prior to, the Stockholders Meeting of the status of the Requisite
Company Vote.

 

7.5 _Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub; Obligations of Merger Sub_.

 

(a) Immediately following execution of this Agreement, Parent shall execute
and deliver, in accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational
Documents, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent
and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either
of them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants,
agreements and obligations pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

7.6  _Cooperation; Efforts to Consummate_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Company
and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries, and with respect to Parent, the Equity Financing
Source and its other Affiliates, to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Transactions
as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly
as reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings (including (i) by filing no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the notification and report
form required under the HSR Act, and (ii) by filing no later than May 11, 2018
all other notifications (or, where customary, draft notifications to be
followed in the ordinary course by formal notifications) required under
the Antitrust Laws of the other jurisdictions listed in Section 8.1(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and in each case requesting, where applicable,
early termination of the waiting periods with respect to the Merger) and to
obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Transactions. Nothing in this Agreement shall require or be construed to
require the Company or its Subsidiaries to proffer to, or agree to, incur any
liabilities or any sale, divestiture, license, disposition or holding separate
of, or any termination, prohibition, limitation, restriction or other action
with respect to existing relationships, contracts, assets, product lines or
businesses or interests therein of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
unless the effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 



-43- (b) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in
good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, and with respect to Parent, its other Affiliates, that appears
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions (including the
Proxy Statement). Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its
officers or other Representatives to participate in any meeting or substantive
correspondence or telephone discussion with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the
Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall be primarily responsible for
directing the process by which the parties seek to avoid or eliminate
impediments under any applicable antitrust or competition Laws in the United
States and shall take the lead in and control all discussions, negotiations
and other communications with Governmental Antitrust Entities, subject to good
faith consultations with the Company. In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

(c) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Merger, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received
by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from
any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and
the other Transactions.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 7.6, but on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Company (in the case of clause (i) below) and Parent
(in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) below) agree to take or cause to
be taken the following actions:

 

(i) promptly provide to each and every federal, state, local or foreign court
or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable
Antitrust Law (each, a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-privileged
information and documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or
that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
Transactions;

(ii) promptly use its reasonable best efforts to take all
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable steps to (A) avoid the entry of,
and (B) resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove
any actual, anticipated or threatened temporary, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or judgment
entered or issued, or that becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or
issued, in any Proceeding or inquiry of any kind, in the case of each of the
foregoing clauses (A) and (B), that would reasonably be expected to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit or make unlawful the
consummation of the Transactions, including the defense through litigation on
the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other Proceeding by
any Person seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Transactions and the proffer and agreement by Parent of
its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease,
license, disposal

 



-44-  and holding separate of, assets, operations, rights, product lines,
licenses, businesses or interests therein of the Company, Parent, either of
their respective Subsidiaries or, with respect to Parent, its other
Affiliates (and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of,
the relevant Governmental Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if such
action should be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable so as to permit
the consummation of the Transactions as promptly as practicable ( _it_
_being_ _understood_ that, no such action will be binding on the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates unless it is contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing); and

(iii) promptly use its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment,
determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any Proceeding,
review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger or
the other Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful
or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger or the other Transactions, any and all steps
(including, without limitation, the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or
the taking of the other steps contemplated hereby) as may be necessary or
appropriate to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate,
avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit such
consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 7.6, but on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the Company (in the case of clause (i) below) and Parent
(in the case of clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) below) agree to take or
cause to be taken the following actions:

 

(i) promptly provide to BaFin and the FFSA all information and documents as
required by applicable Laws, or as requested by BaFin or the German Federal
Reserve ( _Bundesbank_ ) or the FFSA or that are necessary, proper or
advisable in regards to the regulatory status of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, all of which information shall be accurate, complete and in
compliance with applicable Law;

(ii) file promptly and within the deadlines set by applicable Laws, and in any
event substantially simultaneous with the execution of this Agreement, a
notification of intent to purchase an indirect significant stake in InterCard
AG pursuant to Section 14 para. 1 of the German Payment Services Act (
_Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz_ ) in connection with Section 2c of the
German Banking Act ( _Kreditwesengesetz_ ) with BaFin and the German Federal
Reserve ( _Bundesbank_ );

(iii) file promptly and within the deadlines set by applicable Laws, a
notification of intent to purchase an indirect significant stake in Verifone
Finland Oy pursuant to Section 21c of the Finnish Act on Payment
Institutions ( _Maksulaitoslaki_ ); and

 



-45- (iv) other than as would result in a Burdensome Condition, use reasonable best
efforts to take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law relating to any consent, approval, no-action
letter or authorization by BaFin and/or the FFSA to enable the parties hereto
to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as promptly as
practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside Date, including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
arrangements or orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of such of its and their assets, properties or businesses or of
the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by Parent pursuant hereto,
and entering into such other arrangements, as are necessary in order to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law relating to any consent,
approval, no-action letter or authorization by BaFin and/or the FFSA to enable
the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions and to
avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order
or other order in any suit or Proceeding that would otherwise have the effect
of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the Merger and the
other Transactions; provided, that any such sale, divestiture, license or
other disposition referred to above may be conditioned upon any necessary
consent, approval or authorization by BaFin and/or the FFSA of consummation of
the Merger and the other Transactions or confirmation that such sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition renders BaFin and/or FFSA approval
unnecessary; provided further that, in the event (A) Parent fails in a timely
manner to take any actions required to be taken under this Section 7.6(e)(iv)
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law relating to any
consent, approval, no-action letter or authorization by BaFin and/or the FFSA
to enable the parties hereto to consummate the Merger and the other
Transactions, or (B) the Company shall determine in good faith that it would
be most expeditious to avoid or eliminate each and every such impediment for
the Company, rather than the Parent, to take action, the Company may,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.1
or elsewhere in this Agreement, take any and all such actions described in
this Section 7.6(e)(iv) to avoid or eliminate any such impediment to enable
the Parties to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions so long as
such actions shall not result in a Burdensome Condition; provided further
that, beginning the earlier of (i) fifteen (15) days following the receipt of
all Requisite Regulatory Approvals other than the approval of the FFSA and
(ii) the sixtieth (60th) day prior to the date that would otherwise be the
Outside Date (after giving effect to two (2) extensions thereof pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)), the steps required or permitted to be taken under this
Section 7.6(e) to obtain the approval of the FFSA may result in a Burdensome
Condition.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.6,
Parent shall not be obligated to share any confidential or personally
identifiable information with the Company in connection with any filing made
under this Section 7.6(e), including by virtue of the Company attending any
meeting or phone call with BaFin or FFSA, provided that such information may
be shared with Sullivan and Cromwell LLP as the Companys legal advisor, one
German counsel appointed by the Company (in the case of the BaFin filing) and
one Finnish counsel appointed by the Company (in the case of the FFSA filing),
in all circumstances for attorneys eyes only and not to be shared with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Further, the Company or such counsel
shall be afforded prior review of materials to be submitted, or given the
opportunity to participate in calls or meetings with BaFin and FFSA, only to
the extent practicable; provided that Parent will provide such materials, or a
summary of the content of such calls or meetings, to the Company or such
counsel as soon as practicable.

 



-46- 7.7 _Status; Notifications_. Subject to applicable Law and as otherwise
required by any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep
the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the consummation of
the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as
applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party or
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions.

 

7.8 _Information; Access and Reports_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each shall, upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement, or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and the
Effective Time, upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Law,
the Company shall (i) give to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the offices, properties, employees, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives such
financial and operating data and other information as Parent may reasonably
request, provided that, in each case, the Company shall not be required to
permit any inspection, or disclose any document or information, that would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company, (A) result in the disclosure of any
Trade Secrets of any third parties or violate the terms of any confidentiality
provisions in any agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement (or entered into after the date of this Agreement in
compliance with Section 7.1), (B) result in a violation of applicable Law,
including any fiduciary duty, (C) waive the protection of any attorney-client
privilege or (D) result in the disclosure of any sensitive or personal
information that would expose the Company to the risk of liability. In the
event that the Company objects to any request submitted pursuant to and in
accordance with this Section 7.8 and withholds information on the basis of
the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), the Company shall inform the Parent
as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in good faith to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing
impediments, including through the use of commercially reasonable efforts to
(A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to
provide such information and (B) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable
measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove
the basis for the objection. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 7.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Representatives will be permitted to collect or analyze any environmental
samples or perform any invasive environmental investigation of the type
commonly referred to as a "Phase II" environmental investigation with respect
to any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
access provisions of this Section 7.8. No information or knowledge obtained in
any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder. All
information made available or disclosed pursuant to this Section 7.8 shall be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



-47- (b) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this Section 7.8 or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. It is the intention of the Parties that all
such information that is entitled to protection under the attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege shall remain
entitled to such protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under
the joint defense doctrine.

(c) No exchange of information or investigation by Parent or its
Representatives shall affect or be deemed to affect, modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement.

7.9 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the Transactions
shall be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
consult with each other, and provide meaningful opportunity for review and
give due consideration to reasonable comments by the other Party, prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making planned public statements with
respect to the Transactions and prior to making any filings with any third
party or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange)
with respect thereto, except (i) as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or (ii) with respect to any Change of Recommendation made
in accordance with this Agreement or Parents response thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.9, each of the
Parties may make public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors, business partners or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company.

 

7.10 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries at
the Effective Time who continues to remain employed with the Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") shall, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time (or if earlier, the
date of the Continuing Employees termination of employment with the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary), be provided with (i) base salary or base wage
that is no less favorable than the base salary or base wage provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual cash incentive opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable than the
target annual cash incentive opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii) employee
benefits (other than defined benefit pension, deferred compensation,
severance, equity based, post-termination or retiree welfare benefits) that
are

 



-48-  substantially comparable in the aggregate, to those provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than defined benefit pension, deferred compensation,
severance, equity based, post-termination or retiree welfare benefits), and
(iv) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
requirements of this sentence shall not apply to Continuing Employees who are
covered by an agreement with a works council or like organization. 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain the existing Company Benefit Plans that are health
and welfare or retirement benefit plans or cause Continuing Employees to
become eligible to participate in comparable benefit plans that are not
Company Benefit Plans (" _New Plans_ "), in each case in accordance
with Sections 7.10(a) and 7.10(c). With respect to any New Plans, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any New Plans
providing health benefits in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
to be waived with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan, (ii) in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs give
each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made under the Company Benefit Plans, and (iii) give each Continuing
Employee service credit for such Continuing Employees employment with the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual (for
purposes of vacation benefits only) and eligibility to participate under each
applicable New Plan, as if such service had been performed with the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or their relevant Affiliate, to the extent such service
was credited for the same purpose under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, as
applicable, except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans or
any purpose under any equity-based plan or arrangement entered into after the
Closing Date other than the Replacement Deferred Cash Awards or to the extent
it would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation.

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and assume all
employee benefit obligations to current and former employees under
the Company Benefit Plans set forth on Section 7.10(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The Parties agree that the consummation of the Transactions
and the occurrence of the Effective Time shall constitute a "change in
control", "change of control" or any term of similar import for purposes of
the Company Benefit Plans.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Compensation Committee shall in
its discretion determine allocations in respect of the Companys annual
incentive cash bonus plans for the 2018 performance year (the " _2018 Annual
Bonus Plan_ ") among participants of such plan based on "target" achievement
of all performance goals. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to) cause such bonuses under the 2018 Bonus
Plans to be paid in accordance with the Company Compensation Committees
determinations. Such payments shall be made in a manner consistent with the
Companys historical timing for making bonus payments under its annual bonus
plans, but no later than December 31, 2018. Payment of bonuses earned under
the 2018 Bonus Plans in accordance with

 



-49-  this Section 7.10(d) shall be conditioned upon each applicable Continuing
Employees continued employment with the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
through the payment date; provided, that if a Continuing Employee undergoes a
Qualifying Termination between the Effective Time and such payment date, such
Continuing Employee shall be paid his or her bonus under the 2018 Annual Bonus
Plan in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.10(d). " _Qualifying
Termination_ " has the meaning set forth in Section 7.10(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
establishment, modification or amendment of any particular Company Benefit
Plan or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, practice,
agreement or arrangement, (ii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their benefit
or compensation plans, programs, policies, practices, agreements or
arrangements or, after the Effective Time, any Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from modifying or
terminating (for any or no reason) the employment or service, or any
particular term or condition of employment or service, of any Continuing
Employee or any other Person or (iv) create any rights in any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or
any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain, or to create any rights
or remedies (including any third-party beneficiary rights, other than as set
forth in Section 7.12) in any Person for any purpose.

(f) To the extent reasonably practicable, prior to making any broad-based
written communications to the directors, officers or employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that
are affected by the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended
communication, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and the Company shall consider any such
comments in good faith.

7.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the Transactions, including all fees and expenses of its Representatives,
shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense.

7.12 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Companys Organizational
Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former
(determined as of the Effective Time) director and officer of the Company, in
each case, when acting in such capacity or in serving as a director, officer,
member, trustee, Representative or fiduciary of another entity or enterprise,
including a Company Benefit Plan, at the request or for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including reasonable

 



-50-  attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any
Proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including in
connection with (i) the Transactions, and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted to do so under applicable Law and
the Companys Organizational Documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking in customary form to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final adjudication that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies
(providing only for the Side A coverage where the existing policies also
include Side B coverage for the Company) for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of six years from and after the Effective Time
(the " _Tail Period_ ") from one or more insurance carriers with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date of
this Agreement with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as
favorable to the insureds as the Companys existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions). If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for the Tail Period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits
of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the annual premium of the DandO Insurance during the
Tail Period exceed 300 percent of the last annual premium paid by the Company
for such purpose; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such
insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

 

(c) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any Indemnified Party as provided in the Organizational Documents of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between
such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the
Transactions unchanged and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 



-51- (d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case
may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.12.

 

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 7.12 are in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
any applicable Contracts or Laws, and nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any of their respective directors, officers or other employees ( _it_ _being_
_understood_  that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.12 is
not prior to or in substitution of any such claims under such policies).

 

(f) This Section 7.12 is intended to be for the benefit of, and from and after
the Effective Time shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
who shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.12.

7.13 _Financing_ _and Financing Cooperation._

(a) _No Amendments to Financing Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not (without
the prior written consent of the Company) permit any amendment or modification
(including an amendment or modification effected by way of side letter) to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing
Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver would or could
reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce either the aggregate amount of or the
net proceeds to Parent from the Debt Financing (unless the Equity Financing
is increased by an equivalent amount or the representations in Section 6.7(d)
(as though made at the time of the effectuation of such amendment,
modification, supplement or replacement) shall remain true and correct after
taking into account such reduction) or reduce the aggregate amount of the
Equity Financing, (ii) impose new or additional conditions precedent (except
in connection with any "flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter made available to the Company as of the date of this Agreement) to the
funding of the Financing, in a manner that would, or could reasonably be
expected to (A) delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger, or (B) make
the timely funding of the Financing less likely to occur in any respect, or
(iii) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
(solely with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter), to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto (provided that, each of Parent and
Merger Sub may, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend or
modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this

 



-52-  Agreement). In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall not release or
consent to the termination of the Debt Commitment Letters or of any individual
lender under the Debt Commitment Letters, except for (x) assignments and
replacements of an individual lender under the terms of, and only in
connection with, the syndication of the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letters, or (y) replacements of the Debt Commitment Letters with
alternative financing commitments pursuant to Section 7.13(c).

(b) _Equity Financing_. Parent shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
and do (or cause to be done) all things necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Equity Financing, including by (i) maintaining in effect the Equity
Commitment Letter, (ii) complying with its obligations under the Equity
Commitment Letter, (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to Parent or Merger Sub in such Equity Commitment Letter that are
within its control, if any, (iv) enforcing its rights under the Equity
Commitment Letter, including through the initiation of legal proceedings
against the Equity Financing Source if and to the extent necessary to obtain
the Equity Financing contemplated thereby and (v) consummating the Equity
Financing at or prior to Closing, including by causing the Equity Financing
Source to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing, in each case in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter.

 

(c) _Debt Financing and Alternative Debt Financing_. Parent shall use (or
cause Merger Sub to use) its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and obtain the financing contemplated thereby as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any flex provisions) set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, subject to modifications not prohibited
hereunder, (ii) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(iii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, subject to modifications not prohibited hereunder, (iv)
satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver to) all conditions to funding
that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Commitment Letter
and the definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, (v) enforce its rights pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter, and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to
the Closing, including by using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at the Closing. Parent and Merger
Sub will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees
arising pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter as and when they become due.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources on terms and conditions not less favorable
in the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient, when taken together with the
Equity Financing and the available portion of the Debt Financing,
to consummate the Transactions, as the case may be (the " _Alternative Debt
Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternative Debt Financing (such new
financing commitment letters, together with any related fee letters,

 



-53-  exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements, term sheets and other agreements,
the " _New Debt Commitment Letters_ "), which New Debt Commitment Letters will
replace the existing Debt Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Parent shall
promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Debt Commitment Letters
(except that the fee amounts, pricing caps, other economic terms and "market
flex" provisions contained in any fee letters may be redacted so long as no
redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the amount, conditionality,
availability or termination of the Alternative Debt Financing). In the event
that any New Debt Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this
Agreement to the "Financing Commitment Letters" or the "Debt Commitment
Letter" will be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not
superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter at the time in question and any
New Debt Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect, and (B) any
reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" or the "Debt Financing" means
the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified
pursuant to the foregoing.

(d) _Information_. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
and shall provide the Company with copies of all executed definitive
agreements and all exhibits thereto related to the Financing if
requested. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company (i) of any material breach or
default by any party to the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing of which Parent has Knowledge, (ii) of
the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication
from the Equity Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source with respect to
any breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to a Financing
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement related to the Financing of any
provisions of such Financing Commitment Letter or such definitive agreement
and (iii) if for any reason, Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms,
in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing Commitment
Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing; _provided_
, however, that in no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose
any information pursuant to the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) that is
subject to attorney-client or similar privilege; _provided_ , further, that
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure of such information in a manner
that would not risk waiver of such privilege.

 

(e) _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(i) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives, _including_ legal and accounting, to
provide (in each case at Parents sole expense) all cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent that is customary in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, including, but not limited to using
reasonable best efforts to, (i) assist in preparation for and participate (and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause senior management to
participate) in a reasonable number of meetings (but no more than two (2) in
person "bank meetings" and additional telephonic meetings at reasonably agreed
times), due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows, and
presentations with prospective lenders and rating agencies, and otherwise
using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the marketing efforts
for the Debt Financing, (ii) assist with the timely preparation of customary

to give rise to the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2

or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,

termination without cause following a change in control under the Companys
Director Deferred Compensation Plan and related RSU Awards.

stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, other
Representatives or the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective
assets; provided, however, that this Section 9.5(d)(iii) shall not limit the

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party
to consummate the Transactions are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees
that, subject to Section 9.5(d), Section 9.7 and this Section 10.6, in

Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than a
Proceeding to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to such Party pursuant

requirements set forth in clauses (A) and (B) below, and the right of the
Company to specific performance in connection with enforcing (x) such
obligation of Parent and the Companys third party beneficiary rights under
the Equity Commitment Letter will be subject to the requirements that (A) all
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 have been and
continue to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the time the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of
the Equity Financing to be funded); (B) the Debt Financing has been funded or
will be funded in full at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at
the Closing; (C) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the
date required pursuant to Section 2.2; and (D) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in a written notice to Parent that if specific performance
is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it
would take such actions that are required of it by this Agreement to cause the
Closing to occur (and the Company has not revoked, withdrawn, modified or
conditioned such irrevocable confirmation), and Parent and Merger Sub fail to
complete the Closing within three (3) Business Days after delivery of the
Companys irrevocable written confirmation. In no event will the Company be
entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger unless the
Debt Financing has been funded in full or will be funded in full at the
Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing. Subject to Sections
9.5(d)(iii) and 9.7, the election to pursue an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, while
the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as an only to the
extent permitted by this Section 10.6 and the payment of the Parent

10.8 _Entire Agreement_.

 

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules), the Company

Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, understandings and, representations
and warranties, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matters
hereof.

(b) In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of
this Agreement, on the one hand, and the Exhibits, Schedules, the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter (other than an exception
expressly set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure
Letter (as applicable)), or the Confidentiality Agreement, on the other hand,
the statements in the body of this Agreement shall control.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (i) no Party has made or
is making any other representations, warranties, statements, information or
inducements, (ii) no Party has relied on or is relying on any other
representations, warranties, statements, information or inducements and (iii)
each Party hereby disclaims reliance on any other representations, warranties,
statements, information or inducements, oral or written, express or implied,
or as to the accuracy or completeness of any statements or other information,
made by, or made available by, itself or any of its Representatives, in each
case with respect to, or in connection with, the negotiation, execution
or delivery of this Agreement, any instrument or other document delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or the Transactions, and notwithstanding the
distribution, disclosure or other delivery to the other or the others
Representatives of any documentation or other information with respect to any
one or more of the foregoing, and waives any claims or causes of action
relating thereto.

 



-87- 10.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) from and after the Effective
Time, the Indemnified Parties with respect to (i) the provisions of 7.12 [
_Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_ ], (ii) the
right of holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards as of the
Effective Time, after the Effective Time, to receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Article III of this Agreement (and for the
right of (A) each holder of any Company Equity Award that will be converted to
a Replacement Deferred Cash Award to enforce the terms of such Replacement
Deferred Cash Award and (B) each Rollover Eligible Individual to elect to have
all or a portion of the Vested Company Options treated as Rollover Equity
Awards) and (iii) the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent

that each Debt Financing Source shall be an express third party beneficiary
with respect to Sections 9.7(c), 10.3(a), 10.5(a), 10.5(c), 10.6(d), 10.9 and
10.10, the Parties hereby agree that their respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors,
legal representatives and permitted assigns any rights or remedies, express
or implied, hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement. The representations and warranties
in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with Section 10.3 without notice or liability to
any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

10.10 _Non-Recourse_. Unless expressly agreed to otherwise by the Parties in
writing, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Proceeding in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise resulting from this Agreement,
any instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the
Transactions may only be brought against the Persons expressly named as
Parties (or any of their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns) and then only with respect to the specific obligations set
forth herein with respect to such Party. No past, present or future director,
employee (including any officer), incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, other equity holder or Persons in a similar capacity,
controlling Person, Affiliate or other Representative of any Party or of any
Affiliate of any Party, or any of their respective successors, Representatives
and permitted assigns (unless, for the avoidance of doubt, such Person is a
Party), shall have any liability or other obligation for any obligation of any
Party under this Agreement or for any Proceeding in connection with, arising
out of or otherwise resulting from this Agreement, any instrument or other
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or the Transactions; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this Section 10.10 shall limit any liability or
other obligation of the Parties for breaches of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

 



-88- 10.11 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Whenever this Agreement requires an
Affiliate of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Affiliate to take
such action. Whenever this Agreement requires an Affiliate of the Company to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking
on the part of the Company to cause such Affiliate to take such action and,
after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Affiliate to take such action. Any obligation of one Party to any other
Party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
properly fulfilled by an Affiliate of such Party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such Party.

 

10.12. [Reserved].

10.13  _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is illegal,
invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision to be
negotiated by the Parties, each acting reasonably and in good faith shall be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be legal, valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or enforceability
of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other
jurisdiction.

10.14 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties (and any of their respective successors,
legal representatives and permitted assigns). Except as may be required to
satisfy the obligations contemplated by Section 7.12 [ _Indemnification;
Directors  and Officers Insurance_], no Party may assign any of its rights
or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part,
by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the
other Parties, except as provided for in Section 10.11 [ _Fulfillment of
Obligations_ ], and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation in
violation of this Section 10.14 shall be null and void; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent may designate another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a constituent corporation in the Merger in lieu of Merger
Sub, so long as Parent provides the Company with advance written notice
thereof, in which event all references to Merger Sub in this Agreement shall
be deemed references to such other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, except
that all representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such other wholly owned Subsidiary as of
the date of such designation; _provided_ , _further_ that any such designation
shall not reasonably be expected (in the Companys reasonable determination)
to prevent or materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the stockholders of
the Company under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent or
Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part from time to time, to (a) one or more of its
Affiliates and/or any parties providing Debt Financing pursuant to the terms
thereof (including for the purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral in respect of such Debt
Financing) at any time, and (b) after the Effective Time, to any Person.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 



-89- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties to this Agreement as of the date
first written above.

Exhibit A-2 _ARTICLE ELEVEN_

 

If any director of the Corporation who is not, and has not previously been, an
employee of the Corporation (each such director, a " _Non-Employee
Director_"), acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may
be an investment or business opportunity or prospective economic or
competitive advantage in which the Corporation could have an interest or
expectancy (a " _Competitive Opportunity_ "), or otherwise is then exploiting
any Competitive Opportunity, the Corporation will have no interest in such
Competitive Opportunity and no expectation that such Competitive Opportunity
be offered to it, any such interest or expectation being hereby renounced so
that each Non-Employee Director shall (i) have no duty to communicate or
present such Competitive Opportunity to the Corporation and (ii) have the
right to hold any such Competitive Opportunity for such Non-Employee
Directors (and its agents, partners or affiliates) own account and
benefit, or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer or deal in such
Competitive Opportunity to or with persons or entities other than the
Corporation or any affiliate of the Corporation. No amendment or repeal of
this _Article Eleven_  shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or
alleged liability of any Non-Employee Director for or with respect to any
opportunities of which such Non-Employee Director becomes aware prior to such
amendment or repeal.

_ARTICLE TWELVE_

 

To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the
Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. Any amendment,
modification or repeal of this _Article Twelve_ shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation that exists
at the time of such amendment, modification or repeal. The Corporation shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify and
upon request shall advance expenses to any person who is involved (including,
without limitation, as a witness) or is or was a party or is threatened to be
made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding
or claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to be a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer, is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee,
employee or agent (or in any other capacity while so serving) of any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (an "
_indemnitee_ "), including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
against all expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses), liabilities,
losses, judgments, fines, penalties, excise taxes or penalties under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to
time (" _ERISA_ "), and amounts paid in settlement incurred or suffered in
connection with the investigation, preparation to defend or defense of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim, and such indemnification shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Corporation to
indemnify or advance expenses to any person in connection with any action,
suit, proceeding or claim initiated by or on behalf of such person or any
counterclaim against the Corporation initiated by or on behalf of such person.
Such indemnification shall not be exclusive of other indemnification rights
arising under any by-law, agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or
otherwise and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal
representatives of 

 



Exhibit A-3  such person. Any person seeking indemnification under this _Article Twelve_
shall be deemed to have met the standard of conduct required for such
indemnification unless the contrary shall be established. The Corporation
hereby acknowledges that certain indemnitees affiliated with institutional
investors may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and/or insurance provided by such institutional investors or certain of their
affiliates (collectively, the " _Institutional Indemnitors_ "). The
Corporation hereby agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e.,
its obligations to the indemnitee are primary and any obligation of the
Institutional Indemnitors to advance expenses or to provide indemnification
for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the indemnitee are
secondary), (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by the indemnitee in accordance with this _Article Twelve_
without regard to any rights the indemnitee may have against the Institutional
Indemnitors and (iii) that it irrevocably waives, relinquishes and releases
the Institutional Indemnitors from any and all claims against the
Institutional Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery
of any kind in respect thereof. The Corporation further agrees that no
advancement or payment by the Institutional Indemnitors on behalf of the
indemnitee with respect to any claim for which the indemnitee has sought
indemnification from the Corporation shall affect the foregoing and the
Institutional Indemnitors shall have a right of contribution and/or be
subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights
of recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation. Expenses (including
attorneys fees, costs and charges) incurred by an indemnitee in defending a
proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf
of the indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall
ultimately be determined that such indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this _Article Twelve_. Any
repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this _Article Twelve_
shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation with respect to any acts or omissions of such director
occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing in this _Article
Twelve_ , any present and former (determined as of the Effective Time (as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 9, 2018 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among the Corporation, Vertex Holdco LLC and
Vertex Merger Sub LLC) director or officer of the Corporation shall be
provided with the same rights to indemnification (including any rights to the
advancement of expenses) permitted under applicable law and the Corporations
certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect as of the date of the
Merger Agreement in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. If this
_Article Twelve_ or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by
any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless
indemnify each person entitled to indemnification under the first paragraph
of this _Article Twelve_ as to all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys fees and related disbursements, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes and penalties, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which
indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this _Article Twelve_
to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this _Article
Twelve_ that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted
by applicable law.
